(i'm on a fixed income.) it's a st on the bus and go to the theater. it's been a great way to get myself going a few times a week. i love movies and enjoy going to quiet, morning matinees when the theater isn't as full (i get panic attacks in crowded places), sometimes there's only 3 or 4 people in the theater with me so it's like my own private showing. so maybe if you're like me and love movies, a subscription service may be the thing to help you leave the house. amc theaters also has a subscription service for $20 a month if you can afford that. (this is in the us). sinema has plans starting at $4.99 a month. if you love movies and want to have a motivation to leave the house once in a while, this may be a good idea for you.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prob_adhd\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.27123010661667146,\n        \"min\": 1.0735532e-05,\n        \"max\": 0.9135881,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 69,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0620401\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prob_anxiety\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.2634821385232234,\n        \"min\": 1.2745199e-05,\n        \"max\": 0.97770464,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 69,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.060043816\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prob_bipolar\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.11757729401058094,\n        \"min\": 0.00012788306,\n        \"max\": 0.4178276,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 69,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.14221746\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prob_depression\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.34210875686419867,\n        \"min\": 0.00016044106,\n        \"max\": 0.95366436,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 69,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.6962681\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prob_ptsd\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.37067483336549256,\n        \"min\": 0.002491008,\n        \"max\": 0.99960166,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 69,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.018420588\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prob_none\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.08521103626960896,\n        \"min\": 5.2302374e-05,\n        \"max\": 0.6049377,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 69,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.02100989\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":12}],"source":["#@title Inspect the result dataframe\n","errs = res_df[(res_df['actual'] == 'bipolar') & (res_df['predicted'] != 'bipolar') ]\n","errs.sort_values(by='prob_bipolar', ascending=False)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Inspect patterns in the post - part 1\n","Check if the class name string of each class-id is present in the posts.
