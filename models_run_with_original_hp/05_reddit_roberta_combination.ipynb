clean up garbage and stuff so it's not anywhere near hoarding levels. it's more that i have a ton of random crap that i don't know what to do with so it ends up just sitting in one spot and living there. i know there's tons of advice on clutter/organizing and all that.. and i know i could use it. the problem is that i have an all-or-nothing attitude that makes breaking large things down into manageable chunks very hard. so instead of being a reasonable adult and maintaining a clean environment by doing like.. 20 mins of work a day... i'll avoid it for half a year, spend an entire day deep cleaning until there's not a spec of dust anywhere.. and then rinse and repeat 5-6 months later. this also doesn't really organize things either. stuff just gets migrated into either a box, some shelf, or somewhere else. just glancing right now i see: a tube of fish food for the goldfish i have not had for over 4 months, a heating pad from when i hurt my knee, a roll of paper towel, a relaxation cassette tap from the 80's, a tape measure, 3 cans of condensed air for cleaning computers (actually relevant and useful, but somehow i ended up using all 3 at once so now i have 3 of them), a cd with drivers for the dell computer we had 10 years ago, a photo album that somehow ended up living next to the compressed air cans... you get the picture. logically, i know what to do to clean up.. just start somewhere. i just hate the idea that i'll probably do what i always do and just shuffle everything around or stick random crap in boxes. please tell me others deal with this bullcrap. it's an eyesore, it stresses me out, and it makes me feel so incredibly stupid because it's not rocket science on how to fix the problem... but somehow i still end up taking one look and thinking i'll start on it in an hour. i decided to set aside 20 mins a day at a specified time to force myself to just start on it.. because otherwise i just keep avoiding it until i snap and clean everything in a 5-6 hour time span. what is silly is that i have pet birds and i have no problem cleaning their cage weekly and doing all the daily maintenance required.. it's just when it's random crap that somehow my brain chemistry malfunctions and i suddenly don't know what to do with anything.\",\n          \"i've done the usual distracted adhd-brain stuff. opened the dishwasher instead of the fridge on the other side of the room, taken my dog for a walk on the long leash without putting her harness one for when the long leash goes on, going out in two different shoes and only noticing when i come home.... but yesterday, evening, i topped it all. we wanted to walk the dog. my so is done and waiting the dog is dressed.... and i'm off meds because its late. so i run it through in my head. treats, poop bag, clicker, i'm wearing a jacket, ball, gloves for the long leash, shoes. i pick up my gloves, mumbling the list over and over. i only need to put on gloves and shoes. i shake the gloves out, open one, lean my shoulder against the wall, lift a leg and.... attempt to put my foot into it. after all, my brain says \\\"shoes\\\". my so burst out laughing (he'd apparently been watching in fascinated \\\"she isn't really going to....\\\"-horror), i burst out laughing once i realised what was wrong (because yes, there were a few seconds of utter \\\"wait, something isn't right\\\" - confusion) and it ended with us both sitting on the floor, laughing to the point of tears. it was a lovely end to an otherwise stressy day, but i'm so glad i have my meds.\",\n          \"i'm a survivor of sexual abuse that occurred 10 years ago, but i didn't understand what happened until a few years ago and i've only recently started going to therapy specifically to process this and learn to function again. anyway, it used to be that when i'd be triggered, i would experience flash backs or panic attacks, etc. but now it seems that my brain has become quite adept at dissociation, and i sink into a deep fog. sometimes it's a good thing, but other times i wish i could pull myself out of it so i could feel the emotions i need to feel. for example, today, i've felt like crying for hours now but every time it starts to come up, that feeling immediately gets pushed back down. it's so tiring. if anyone else gets this too, how does it affect you and do you do anything to redirect your mind or do you accept that's where you're at and just wait for it to stop? i'm mostly just curious about other people's experiences. thanks.\"\n        ],\n

finally raised the funds for an adhd assessment after months and months of wondering what if? and it's on friday! i was asked for someone who knew me as a child, and someone who knows me now, to fill out a questionnaire about me. my best friend of 10 years was brutally honest (her words) in her questionnaire, and told me afterwards that it completely makes sense now, that i must have adhd based on her realisations of the symptoms. my mother however, messaged me afterwards to say \\\"done it. i answered no to all of them\\ud83e\\udd23\\\" like... for real? i had to embarrassingly send an email to the pa to explain that while she is my mother, she also has never believed any ailment i have, including the 10 years of physical agony i was in until my diagnosis at 21 of fibromyalgia (of which she scoffed at). she didn't believe me when i told her i was physically and mentally abused at 15 by my then boyfriend (i even overheard her agreeing with my ex that i was probably lying because i have a record of it) she didn't believe that i have a sensitivity to light, sound and temperature, and couldn't touch certain materials. i'd get an eye roll and a \\\"whatever\\\" why? because when i was younger, i took risky impulse actions. i stole, i lied, i cheated. i started smoking, drinking, skipping school at 14(sometimes for days). so because i lied and stole when i was younger, anything else i say is a lie. keep in mind that from 8, i was playing out all the time, 11 i was gaming all night, 14 i started hanging out with bad people and would spend every living day with them. i moved into my nans at 18 and that was it. she was never involved with my school work, homework and never asked me to do chores. so how can she have an opinion on what i was like? she had no fucking idea because she dismissed any problem i had!! oh, she's also basing her answers on the fact that for a week, she looked after a 4 year old with adhd so i must not have it because i wasn't like him. ugh.

i make it worth it for my dad. we struggle. sometimes we dont know how we'll pay the rent, things get complicated with family, with work, with life. and all of it together makes me wanna opt out. but then i think of leaving him by himself to deal with it himself and what a living hell that would be. even if i cant do much, ill do what i can till i can't. because if i dont that would make me sadder than anything i can ever encounter in my life. my point is that out there there are strong, amazing, incredibly intelligent and driven people, who do this shit alone. while feeling everything. and its heart breaking. my dad spent his life trying to make me feel welcome when every fiber of my being says i don't belong on this earth. the least i can do is gtfo bed and try to do something. even if my battle that day is just to brush my teeth. so that he can see a good looking smile that he made. to make him feel just a little better. that's my part, my mission. thats what gets me up. there are people that can use your help, and you owe it to them. but that s just my opinion.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":12}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["rdt_val"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":423},"id":"X3QUJQn9MrJa","outputId":"f851ab0c-9878-46e4-d00f-e33a0246dcdb","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1722743476856,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"bhaskar borah","userId":"03570468795409183215"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                        ID  \\\n","0     34db02f0-82ed-43e9-ac8b-65db8ba55a95   \n","1     f515fc3a-0f62-4203-bfc8-53a8252a8fc1   \n","2     93ed44ff-20b8-4bc2-b71b-6c7a39fa4775   \n","3     e9ec2f5b-f709-40c4-b4f2-202ebbe5bc87   \n","4     2e6f28e3-acbe-44ac-82f0-a980aa07a464   \n","...                                    ...   \n","1483  55acf4ff-e555-4804-8a15-b3e9a27aecbc   \n","1484  b4821450-78a9-4fde-8da0-9e99a39a49db   \n","1485  d0cea880-458c-41ad-a464-82183fca0bd5   \n","1486  7346a22c-4f59-459c-815b-f3c79e67a8fa   \n","1487  80895763-cba3-41d3-a048-845fb419de00   \n","\n","                                                  title  \\\n","0     do others feel like they have a warped sense o...   \n","1     do you ever feel like one small failure can de...   \n","2     so you've heard about getting a song in your h...   \n","3     anyone here have listening comprehension probl...   \n","4     i finally found a way to wake my ass up in the...   \n","...                                                 ...   \n","1483                    psa: wear earplugs to concerts.   \n","1484  as a cop that worked the may day protests (and...   \n","1485             how to increase your listening skills?

on this list but here were my tsim shah tsui essentials and the do-not-miss places on hk island aqua bar - best view of hong kong island * go up to the bar at 1 peking road. go up to the top and get a cocktail or mocktail. it's slightly pricey but an amazing view of the city. do this in the evening. wa-en - yakiniku that will never let you down * 12/f, the toy hinal. also, if you go up the stairs,

dessert restaurants and this was the best for quality, taste, freshness, authenticity, local atmosphere. highly recommend if you're in causeway bay. northern dumpling yuan * 1 water street, sai ying
