depression,anxiety,3,"we've been dating the past month and i got the balls to ask her out. she said she'll think about it which means no, but i still got the nerve to do it! 😃"
anxiety,bipolar,9,"i am just posting this to ease the minds of people who have gad who sometimes wonder whether it is ""real"" as a disability or not or whether we are making it up, its in our heads, etc.. i came across the stat as i was writing a formal letter requesting an extension on a deadline for my section 8 voucher because of my gad. i was googling whether it was considered a disability or not (i already knew it was...), and i came across that stat which exemplifies how disabling it can be."
bipolar,none,16,"i had my goals lined up for this week in this sub. my sunday line up looked good. and yesterday for mid week checkin i was feeling good. i had one con though which was going to the bank with my mom and fixing up finances aka debt. i was proud that i held in crying in front of the awesomely nice bank consultant. had to bite my tongue a couple of times in the office. but i lost it in the car. heres what triggered me: the bank consulant was 25 with a good job thats steady. im turning 28 in a month to this day and my job is in retail re under her name, i have no idea where my checks from work go. i just quietly assume they just go on paying my debt to my parents, i have no relationship, i have no interests or passion. im sorry im just spiralling down a rabbit hole on my break from my 10 hour shift at work. the worst part was yelling at my mom when shes just trying to be there. sometimes i just feel like a raging monster. how the hell am i to be with a so in the future? thank you for reading. if i didnt vent i may not have the energy for my last 3 hours of work."
ptsd,adhd,21,"i'm diagnosed with schizophrenia, but psychiatrists also tried out adhd, aspergers/autism, dissociative identity disorder, anxiety, major depression, etc etc you get the picture. my psychiatrist is now convinced that i have ptsd, and whether or not he's right about that, there is something traumatic in my past that caused me a lot of pain and coincided with suicide attempts and illicit drug use. but i don't know what happened. i'm generally aware that my family life wasn't good growing up, i know i was unhappy as a kid, but most of what i ""remember"" from earlier than 18 is actse the moment i try to relax, i lose control of my emotions. even mundane memories of walking to school or what my bedroom looked like sends me into a panic or makes me feel like i'm about to cry and throw up. i feel so disgusting and awful anytime i touch any memory from earlier than 18. i know that i couldn't handle it when it happened, and i feel like it'd just destroy me again if i remembered. but this is clearly still affecting me in terms of anxiety and stress, and i can't fix those until i fix the cause. what if trying to fix this just sends me spiralling out of control?"
none,depression,26,"conservatives always talk about personal responsibility, but when it comes to healthcare, that's all it is: talk. when one of them comes whining to you about the cost of obamacare to their business ask them, ""who is paying for your employees' healthcare right now?"" oh, that's right, me. conservatives hate talking about reducing costs. when they say that, what they mean is that they want to pass the burden to the taxpayer, and keep the resulting profit for themselves."
anxiety,depression,30,"i came into this year in a good place after years of wading through shit. i was kicking ass at my job, i have sorted a long term medical problem, i achieved dreams this winter by freeride snowboarding a mountain. i came out as bi / genderfluid to my family and it went well. but this year since then has fucked me up. i haven't touched another human in three months. i've been single for 12 years. i happening again every day recently. i don't want to see any more fucking therapists any more i hate the idea of it. i can't go through reopening all that painful old stuff again i don't want to deal with this bullshit any more. i don't want to burden my family with this, i've put them through enough. fucking 2020. its a good job i don't have a gun because its sure looking like a way to escape recently."
ptsd,depression,33,"i saw your post on weighted blankets and how it can help you sleep. it normally takes me over an hour to fall asleep and normally only sleep about 4-5 hours a night. i gave it a shot and bought a weighted blanket and for the past 2 weeks i have fallen asleep faster than my husband and sleep a glorious 7-8 hours straight. so thank you who ever posted that, because hat was what i clearly needed."
ptsd,bipolar,34,"i (26f) don’t want to go into a lot of detail because i’m still processing everything. i had a psychotic break last week after a huge trigger. last wednesday i drove up to a cabin in the woods and swallowed a bunch of pills until the cops showed up, called by my parents after they tracked me down. they took me to the nearest hospital where i actually escaped then was brought back again by the police out looking for me. i’ve literally lost count of how many attempts i’ve made, but i know it’s in the 20 range. most of them occurred in a 3 month periodanything similar? how did you cope? maybe if i just hide in bed the rest of my life i’ll live to be 80. she said i can do it, but i need to realize the harsh truth of the matter that i have already beat the odds too many times. i feel unfixable. will i be broken forever? will i live until i’m 80? i really hope so, but now i’m not so sure. attempting suicide became a coping mechanism for me years ago but i thought after a year and a half of therapy i could go the rest of my life without an attempt. i don’t know what i’m looking for, any help i guess."
depression,adhd,35,"like you're put on the spot, and suddenly feel this pressure to sound interesting because you realize how boring your routine must appear to a third party. suddenly realizing you spend 70% of your time aimlessly browsing the same 10 subreddits, watching lize one day that i've never actually finished any project in which i've expressed interest. i already know that i will like myself a lot more, have better conversations, and more fulfilling relationships if i can just manage to flip this balance of time."
bipolar,depression,38,"i feel like every time i have a conversation or try to, i’ll have em in the first half, but by the second i imagine the -2 social points from sims. it’s not just imaginary. after i get that feeling, i notice the people from those situations liking me less. i’ at me and my gut is telling me to stop and continuing on until i’ve ruined the atmosphere. telling a joke that is insensitive/being annoying/rambling/etc it feels awful because it does numbers on my reputation. it gets in the way of dating and making friends."
adhd,depression,40,"does anyone else ever just get pissed off at anything that happens some days? like, the tv remote falls off your counter and it's just a pain even though it will take less than a second to pick up and fix or how about constantly having to piss because you drink an excessive amount of water per day and you just can't be fked going all the time? just me..? ok"
none,bipolar,45,i heard the expression before and seems kinda understandable like it's am onomatopoeia or like it really has the feeling it tries to mean... it's like a shivery cringey thing as far as how i understand... could you please correct me if i'm wrong?
ptsd,depression,54,"i feel completely trapped in my own head. i've had that ""chair is about to fall backward"" feeling day in and day out for like three weeks now. it's becoming exhausting. i feel like a thousand screaming emotions are trapped behind a stone exterior. i can't cry or yell or write. i can't express any emotions, even for moms most of the time, it's just particularly bad right now and trying to out-logic my emotions is just overwhelming sometimes. right now is one of those times. you guys are my people and i guess i'm not really looking for solutions, just someone to remind me that it will pass and maybe offer up some tips on self-care."
anxiety,depression,55,"this should be a celebratory post but i've spent two days awake, shaking, throwing up or otherwise... i don't know if i can do it but i can't live the hell of staying in our 1 bedroom apartment any longer. i got hired at an oil and vinegar bar, and i really want to work there because i cook a lot and  shopped there i dreaded when the employees bombed me with information. so yeah, i work at 2 tomorrow expecting to not last the 2 week probation period. everything i'm studying just gets lost in my head and i retreat back to my no window bedroom calm down. but i can't lose my car or stay in this house."
bipolar,depression,64,"i was feeling suicidal a few weeks ago, so maybe my barometer is all messed up and this is just run-of-the-mill happy. but i kind of hope it's not. i've been med compliant for over a decade so i'm not gonna do anything _really_ stupid, but i am really tempted to let this spin out for a bit. i probably won't. but i mean....it's been fucking godawfully miserable, can i just have this one thing."
bipolar,adhd,67,"ok, it isn't the first time i've destroyed it. i've done this so many times. i lost my job on november 18th. i thought i was well liked there, but then work started getting taken away from me. i got maybe a little paranoid. you can look at my post history to see everything. it's to much to type again. boss said i suddenly changed, though i don't see it. i thought my conduct at work was normal for me, but i just wasn't fast enough after they hired a faster groomer. it all exploded that saturday becaost a meme to facebook right now, but nothing encompasses what i need to say. so hi... i'm new here, and i'm having a bad episode. i haven't been on meds since my late teens/early 20's and now i'm back on a mood stabilizer, antidepressant, and xanax. i'm overwhelmed, i'm terrified, i'm broke, i'm sad, i have so much to do and no motivation, the thought of doing more job interviews and starting a new job makes me want to curl up and sleep, i have two kids and christmas is coming, and i can't do this."
ptsd,depression,72,"i tend to internalize everything, i close up and shut down a lot. i don't really get angry at others, just with myself. it really helps for me to talk about it because it seems like i can get rid of some of the things that i've internalized."
ptsd,anxiety,75,"i've been having more panic attacks triggered by loud, sharp sounds, including today where a neighbor's fire alarm put me so on edge and panic-attacky that even after some help from my partner i'm still having a little trouble sleeping. i'm really really tired of just coping, of just keeping sound and light o, but is there at least some way that i can feel better, that i can feel less anxiety, that i can exist without having so many of my coping methods? i mean, i also deal with anxiety for other reasons, and that also hasn't been getting better, but if i could at least take this on separately it would help a bit."
ptsd,anxiety,79,ive come to the situation where i have a brand new partner who wants to hold my hand and this is coming to a head for me again. the second this happens i start to cry and they get put off. they ask if im uncomfortable literally every time no matter the person and i have to say no because its not normal. ive tried to muscle through it but the moment the hand holding gets to hand rubbing i cry again and so on. im 19 what do you think i should do? understandably all of my relationships are very short
adhd,depression,83,"i get really excited about an idea or something and im motivated about it . when it comes time to apply to it (job, student org), i get depressed and don't do well. then afterwards i regret. i keep getting rejected from everything. i'm really fucking upset and the people around me are really fucking tired of hearing me cry all the time. anyone else feel this way"
depression,adhd,84,"- keeping the appointment with the dentist, because tooth pain sucks, even though all you really want to do is stay in bed - scheduling an appointment for the root canal you need, even though the mere thought of the procedure has you quaking in your boots - paying the bill that's ten days late for no reason other than you couldn't bring yourself to task on the day it was due - taking the car to the shop because the check engine light has been on for weeks and the inspection is due at the end of the month - doing all of the above and still not feeling proud of yourself or accomplished because there are a hundred other small things you're avoiding or flat out ignoring just to keep from feeling like your life is spiraling down the drain. who the hell let me adult."
ptsd,anxiety,91,"my new therapist has been really great. today in our third session she asked if i would be more comfortable talking if she wasn't looking at me. i'm never comfortable with eye contact so i always look away, but no one has ever noticed before that i don't like being looked at. she turned away and i looked at the wall for the whole session and it really helped! i am so glad for this. it made such a huge difference for me and i feel a lot better about our sessions in general. i feel kind of stupid but holy shit! a small thing makes a huge difference!"
depression,anxiety,93,"which is wack, because we're all a bunch of strangers hiding behind usernames. but this is such a common theme for me. for example, if someone passes me on the freeway, i immediately assume it's because that person is angry at me and wants to run me over. where is this line of thinking coming from? is it anxiety? i've been depressed for 13 years and this ""everybody hates me empirically"" has only surfaced in the last 1-2 years. anyone else deal with this?"
bipolar,adhd,97,"i can't get motivated to do *anything* but at the same time i'm having difficulty concentrating, i can't hold onto a thought or focus, inside i'm churning do something now fix this do it now. my brain is going i cant think i cant think, nothing is focusing hurry hurry hurry. and my body is acting like a sloth. i can't moooooove. i had to edit posts because i caught myself talking (writing) differently, usually i'm thinking things out, but now i'm reactive and i fear saying things that will have attitude and put people off. like oh that person is a child, laugh it off (when do i say that?). i generally avoid name calling and the like. i feel so flippant. wtf. i've been taking supplements, not currently on meds. have been depressed for a while, short spikes into hypomania with activity. they're ""normal"" vitamins, but something i've taken is making me weird. i've noticed in the past that drinking a lot of coconut water makes me aniagainst the wall, then i will snap out of this weird place hopefully. i can't describe it well. i really don't like it when i don't feel grounded. i can have ups and downs, i can be hypomanic and still be pretty ok, but this just feels fucking weird and disturbing in a way i can't describe. i feel like i'm not myself. though i am aware of myself, it feels like a different personality is pushing in, and my behavior feels weird. and i'm trying to reground myself. i know this is a transitional state it passes within the day or the next and i'll be myself again. but i hate it. it feels icky, for lack of a better word. does any of this make sense? people always get alarmed when i talk about stuff like this, but it's just something i have to manage and get through, it's not something that's an emergency. it's too mild. i ate something and got fresh air and reset. weird. if this is what anxiety or low blood sugar does, that's fucked up."
ptsd,bipolar,101,"i was born the 3rd of 7 siblings to two schizophrenic drug addicts. my older 2 brothers grew up in the luxury of 2 parents that took meds, had jobs and could take care of themselves. however when i came i fucked it all up. i was born with pyloric stenosis (a sphincter is fucked up so the baby can't digest shit, i basically could eat) so from the get go i was a problem for my parents. as shit got worse and they had to help 2 almost teens and 1 infant they stopped being able to care for themselves. they lost jobs, stopped meds and started drinking. my dad became abusive towards us all and was frequently sobering up in jail overnight. shit was hell for a kid to grow up in. eventually my mom got pregnant 4 more times from 1 to 7. (possible rape) and shit went haywire. my eldest brother (now 14,15 or so) became very abusive. he got verbally, physically and eventually sexually. he taught 5 year old me to masturbate, made me do it until i vomited. he'd hit me if i ran away. he eventually taught me about girls/my sisters. i'm not sure how it started (probably blocked it out of my mind due to ptsd) but i began to have sex with my sisters conscentual and not. i was 5/6 years old. i hated myself. my brother would sometimes watch, then call me a peice of shit and say i was going to hell. at 7 i started playing with fire, one day i w i was used to people rejecting me, so used to it i became perversely ""in love"" with it. i did all i could to try and make her get rid of me, show her that i only deserved pain (which i truly believed, and sometimes still do) i gave her hell, yelled tell her i hated her. i never hurt her physically but i hurt he emotionally and verbally. this is what reactive attachment disorder is like (one of my diagnosis) it basically makes it very difficult for someone to feel like they can accept love, so much so that they are willing to hurt to prove themselves right. its fucking horrible, i dont wish it on my worst enemy. luckily my mom is the goat and has stuck through it to the point where i'm at college now. however i still think about my trauma every day, and it affects me so much so that i'm really bad with relationships (friends and romantic). i feel like a horrible person, even though all the stuff i did i had no real control over or even knew was wrong. i still hate myself for what i put my mom through and i fucking hate that i still want a relationship with my bio family. i'm fucking friends on facebook with my eldest brother. it sucks that i was the one to be put on his own out of all my siblings and i was the one that had to go through so many families. i fucking hate it. anyways just wantex to get that shit off my chest"
bipolar,depression,110,"just wanted to share that i finally got myself together enough to book an appointment with the therapist. i kinda stopped going and kept putting it off (it's ok i'll go next month, etc.) three years later i find myself on the edge, i'm relieved to have made the call. wish me luck!"
bipolar,adhd,114,"i promised a friend i'd make a poster and a pin the tail on the donkey game for his kid's birthday. then i forgot - because my own kid had a school project that i threw all my free time this week into. i remembered thursday at work about the posters and started immediately. what i thought would take a few hours turned into, well, let's count. 3 hours last night, 30 minutes this morning, and i've been at it pretty intensely for the last 6 hours. now it's 4:30 in the morning, i have to drive it to his house before work, which starts at 9:30. i feel stupid for this. i also had a twelve hour work day yesterday and it's a job that requires tons of running. i hope they're happy with it all. if they're not... i guess i'll just have to accept that and know that i gave it my best!!!"
ptsd,bipolar,117,"i'm a computer programmer by trade. i worked hard for years at my field, know multiple languages, soak up technology like a sponge, and i'm very good at my job. however, my company embraced and went full tilt into the open office concept with entire floors as a single, giant open office. it's hundreds of people moving around, talking, touching from behind to get your attention, no buffer zonee on me to maintain stability and sanity. while i have been out, work from home has been eliminated in favor of staying in the floor longer, people are quitting, and i'm like, i just want to go back to what i was doing best but not be continuously traumatized. am i just screwed at this point in life? or what? any suggestions from those out there in with boots on the ground? thanks for reading."
ptsd,anxiety,122,"i’m incredibly nervous but i’ve decided to try some medical marijuana this week. maybe next if i chicken out. something has to change. i feel like i’ve been doing whatever i can for the last two decades and plateaued with my health in the last four years or so. my medication, support system, physical activity level, and therapy are helpful but i still feel very frostrain is tailored to my issues and i trust my “bud tender” but am terrified to lose control. but i think it could be the best type of exposure therapy for me. obviously my greatest fear is losing control but having a mild experience with some mj and facing it could be helpful. or it could be really, really bad. anyone relate to this or have tried anything similar ?"
anxiety,bipolar,125,"three months ago mine was mild and i could function with my as needed meds. then i had the most severe panic attack of my life. it quite literally traumatized me. every since i feel everything. and my mind won't shut off. i am always on panic and have panic attacks basically every day now. sometimes multiple ones. before you ask, yes i breathe. yes i try to focus on other shit. i take meds as needed. i've been seeing a therapists. the whole nine. nothing is working anymore, and it keeps progressing. all i do is lie in bed and try to sleep because i can't deal with it. i wish i could go to sleep and never wake up! :(."
ptsd,depression,130,"almost pulled out of the gas station and hit someone. i didn't and stopped just in time. the driver gets out and starts yelling at me and i said i'm sorry. it was an honest mistake. i wasn't cutting him off or anything. now, i'm yelling and telling him to go, but he wont. he blocked me in. so i just lay't see it going well... i'm just not strong enough for this world. it's even just the little things. someone's tone of voice, body language or a way someone words something. im tired of walking around d on egg shells and taking all my strength to try to live a normal life. it's all just weighing me down."
none,depression,133,i think that may be one of the saddest songs in existence. is it pathetic that that song makes me cry whenever i take the time to sit down and listen to it? it is unbelievably sad.
ptsd,bipolar,137,i bought a couple of bluetooth led lights from homedepot for around $15 each. through their app i setup 'schedules' that automatically dim the lights slowly on and off in the morning and at night. when my alarm goes off in the morning the light has been slowly dimming on for 10 mins and usually i am already awake. at night i don't realize why i am suddenly sleepy until the light is almost off. i still have plenty of nights of insomnia but it has helped me create a better routine and it helps so much that it happens automatically. anyone else tried something like this?
anxiety,bipolar,138,"have just come of my meds last month after managing to travel the world for a year on my own and then staring my first year at university. years ago i physically couldn’t leave the house for months at a time out of fear, now i am a completely new person. you can beat this, no matter how long it takes."
bipolar,adhd,142,"i have no motivation to do anything. i don’t go to my one online class, i don’t get off of my couch except for when my dog needs me to, i can’t clean, i can’t do the laundry, my dishes are piling up, and i still can’t make myself get off of this couch. how do y’all push through? what are little things you do to get out of this?"
anxiety,depression,146,"i think about death all the time. everything i do at this point i ask myself why? it won't matter when i'm dead. i keep thinking how i could die tonight, to tomorrow or in my 20's or in my 40's or just go into cardiac arrest before i finish posting this. what if i'm dead before this year ends? what if i'm dead before i meet a girl, or have kids, or hell what if i die before the next time i get to eat a steak or smoke a cigar. does anyone else have this? if so how do you cope? thanks. and sorry if i rambled."
anxiety,depression,149,"which is, now, the longest i've gone without an incident. three years ago i was having them weekly, i couldn't even get on public transport or go into shops. i feel like i've made massive steps and i'm really, really proud of myself. here's to another six!"
adhd,depression,153,"while most people i know can barely muster a tired smirk, even the lamest ones keep me snorting forever. just saw someone here say ""copypasta"" and it had me rolling for minutes. and i'm actually in a horrible mood."
adhd,depression,157,"i don't know how to best explain this feeling i have all the time, but extreme boredom comes kinda close. dissatisfaction with everything. i often hate my life so much, because i feel like i'm never satisfied by anything. i never feel truly happy, truly stimulated, by daily life. waking up, walking dogs, school, work, watching tv, eating, going to bed; it's a continous loop that makes me so very sick. i crave more, and because i don't have the motivation to go find more exciting things i just feel like i could might as well be dead. i'm so bored, so disappointed, so unmotivated, that lying down and just dying seems like a good alternative. what do i even do about this? help."
depression,adhd,158,"i had to turn in my notes for a class, and forgot that i had a bunch of private writing in there. my teacher saw it, showed it to my other teachers, and eventually the principal, who sent me to the school therapist... it was the most embarrassing thing i've ever had to endure. i was called up to the school therapist's office and she showed me some scans of the journal and asked me what was up. it was a series of self deprecating shit about how much of a cunt i am. she had me explain why i was feeling that way, etc. i was in that room for about 2 hours. sounds like an awful situation, right? it turned out to be one of the best days of my life (but somehow still awful).as bad about it? * it was uncomfortable * it was embarrassing. take the fact that this is the only positive post that i have put on this sub (not about me nearly taking my life, or hating it) and realize that there is actual help to be had. even when it's uncomfortable as fuck, as i have come to find out. i'm still not happy, or even content. but i'm more sensible with thinking about the shit that has been going on in my life forever, and am able to think of it with a more realistic perspective. if anyone has any more questions or any advise for people reading this, unsure if they want some guidance or not? please, by all means put something down below. thank you, all."
none,bipolar,160,"for my job, i can take 4 weeks off at once, starting january 1st. i'm very strongly considering antartica, as my only bucket list item is to go to all 7 continents. i've been to 4 and lived in 3... checking off antartica would be a dream! what can you recommend i do? when do think is best to go? i'd most likely go alone. money is a slight consideration... but i'd go into a little credit card debt for this :]"
ptsd,depression,162,"i only feel comfortable communicating with people who have some sort of serious mental health issue themselves as well, or are professionals in the field, thus very understanding. i am so tired of being lonely and limited in my abilities to make connections with people."
anxiety,ptsd,165,"i took the first step. i’ve been struggling so much for the past few months. it’s gotten to the point that i’m barely sleeping and when i do, i have insane nightmares. a couple weeks ago i booked a therapy appointment and it was today. i stood outside the building and came very close to just leaving because the idea of opening up about what i’m strug; if you’re wondering if you should start looking for a therapist, do it. if you’ve found a therapist that seems interesting but you’re not sure if you should reach out, do it. if you’ve made an appointment but you’re not sure if you should attend, attend it. and if you’re standing outside wondering if you should go in, go in. it will help, i promise."

bipolar,adhd,171,"dialectical behavior therapy aims to balance accepting things as they are with aiming for positive change. the main disciples in dbt are mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, emotional regulation, and distress tolerance. each day (if i can keep this up) we will discuss an exercise from one of these topics. the first and most basic distress tolerance skill in my book is distraction. distraction gives you time to create an appropriate response to pain or impulse by temporarily stoping you from thinking about the pain or impulse. distraction is different from avoidance because you still intend to deal with the situation in the future, when you are more ready. sometimes for me if i can distract myself from emotional pain the pain passes on it's own with no further action necessary. an example would be when i get worse depression at night - by morning i f and i've already exercised a lot today). browsing redding will distract me from an impulse. here is a hypothetical example (it's not relevant now, but it will be later). i am bipolar and i am depressed. i want to kill myself now, but i will probably feel better in the morning. i will call my uncle and talk on the phone to distract myself from the pain. if he doesn't pick up, i will pet my dog. it is ok to cry. feel free to type out more than one example. it might be a good idea to do one for feeling up and one for feeling down. this post was guided by the dialectical behavior therapy skills workbook by mckay, wood, and brantley, but it is original content. if you share credit ssnakeggirl and the dialectical behavior therapy skills workbook or you're plagiarizing big time. the book is $11 new and $4 used, so if you want your own copy it's very accessible."
bipolar,depression,175,"hello! i've had insomnia as early as age 7. at this point, my ability to fall and/or stay asleep is so difficult that i am taking sleep when i can. it's not the same as when you sleep a lot because you're depressed. it's just that if i feel sleepy at still able to maintain attendance at school and work. because of this, i've kinda rationalized sleeping this way. i've abided by all the sleep hygiene rules and still no cigar. so this is what i'm settling at. does anyone else do this or feel this way?"
anxiety,depression,178,"i made the call to a place to finally seek some help. i was honest with the lady on the phone and it felt good knowing that i (we!!!) are not alone in this!! i know i will not always feel like this and i hang on to that thought and for now, that's what is getting me through this tough time. may all who read this know that this too shall pass and if anyone needs someone to talk to, i am here to listen."
depression,adhd,186,it's 1:40pm and i am sitting alone in taco bell eating a shredded chicken burrito and nacho fries. dining room is totally empty. wendy's is normally where i go because the dining room is always more active and feels a bit more cozy vs the sterile decor and hard seats of taco bell but i am getting bored of eating the same thing so figured i'd have some tb instead. not even sure of the point to typing this other than than to share my boredom. outside of errands or making service calls to clients my fast food outings are usually the only time i go out of the house.
anxiety,depression,188,"i have had 5 jobs in the last 4 years. i quit every single one of them, usually within a week of commencing. the longest i’ve stayed in a job has been 6 weeks. employment has been my biggest hurdle in my adult life. i become so anxious at work, i start to panic and lose the ability to concentrate. my body goes into fight or flight and i just simply run away and don’t look back. then the guilt, and depression hits me hard. after a good two years of no employment and bvery supportive so fingers crossed i can keep at this and build my confidence up! i know i will have my ups and downs, the anxiety will hit me hard some days more than others but i just have to remember how good working is for my mind and how we all start somewhere. i am proud of myself, it’s so good to be able to say that for the first time in a long time. thank you everyone on this subreddit for being so supportive. i hope to read lots of progress stories on here :)"
anxiety,depression,193,"for example, my parents are going away for a week later this year. i don't want to be at home alone, but i can't sleep out of my house, i haven't slept out in at least 10 years. i asked a friend if they would mind sleeping over and they were like ""sure! i'd be glad to"". i was like, what, they just agreed like that??? they're so cool with sleeping out???? what???? aren't they going to miss their bed? and pets? and family? so weird to me."

ptsd,anxiety,206,i've started to use cbd oil to manage my anxiety and i feel like a person again. i have energy to both accept any negative feelings i have and still put out a positivity to other people. which is something i struggle with when my anxiety is fully active since it pulls me down and it's difficult for me not to come off nasty when all my energy is spent fighting anxious thoughts and coping with the feelings it creates. i have an easier time talking myself down from my anxious thoughts and can function better in public in general. i can focus when i read and not forget things because i don't have my brain going a mile a minute. this stuff makes me feel like my life has changed drastically. i'm so grateful it exists.

adhd,depression,336,"i read and responded to a post on this topic yesterday and op from that post recommended that i make my comment a post of its own. after all the times i've been helped by this community, this finally feels like my opportunity to give back. here goes! \*cracks knuckles\* &amp;#x200b; so i've been struggling with this lately myself. i've been wanting to learn the guitar for literally years but never had the money to buy one. now that i have the money to do it i keep getting cold feet and thinking, ""oh man, i know i'm not gonna be able to stick with it so it's not even worth buying."" but f\*ck it. i'm gonna buy it! here's how i came to that decision. &amp;#x200b; **\*\*1. be kind to yourself!\*\*** obviously, #1 universal rule of adhd, applicable to all scenarios. self-loathing sucks. do your best to be kind to yourself. i recently came across the term ""self-compassion"", which i really like. be at least as nice to yourself as you'd be to other people. you wouldn't make fun of/beat up a loved one who switches hobbies often, so don't do it to yourself! &amp;#x200b; **\*\*2. emphasize dynamic hobbies.\*\*** someone in yesterday's thread used the phrase ""dynamic hobbies"" and i think that's a god damn genius phrase. we need hobbies that we can pick up for a month or two at a time and completely forget for another few months. that's just how my/our hobbies work! we just need to accept that and choose compatible hobbies. last month i got *obsessed* with freshwater aquariums. watched a ton of youtube videos, went to petco to scout potential fish, etc. even bought a fancy ass $100+ fish tank from amazon! then i realized that this is \*not\* a dynamic hobby. forgetting/not caring about my aquarium for months will result in dead fish. **\*error 404: incompatible hobby!\*** fish tank was subsequently returned. relatedly, i had a plant in my bedroom that i needed to water every day or few days. that plant is dead as hell. i now have one of those plants that you only need to remember to water once a month (snake plant, if you're wondering!). plant iscan afford it!). example: i've had a regular gym membership for 6 months and literally only gone 1 single time. it's just too much to actually figure out what workouts i am supposed to be doing, keep myself accountable to the time set for each exercise, etc. also tbh it's honestly kind of boring. i signed up for a workout class last week. the only thing i need to do is show up. they already have the exercises planned so i don't need to think about it. and it's a group class so there's constant motivation to push myself from peers. i have exercised 5 times in the last 7 days! that's like an infinity percent improvement from my previous strategy. i would never have gotten there if i was just trying ""harder"" at a strategy that didn't work for me. &amp;#x200b; **\*\* 6. trying new hobbies is a hobby unto itself!\*\*** what is the definition of a hobby? something you do for fun. some people collect stamps for fun. other people watch birds for fun. others make scrapbooks. you know what i do? try new hobbies! i get pleasure from getting excited about a random thing and diving into it a month at a time. trying new hobbies is my hobby! no sense in feeling guilt or shame about it when it makes me so god damn happy! this is a subtle but ***really important*** reframing. person x would say, ""i collect stamps for fun. last year i found a rare limited edition 1956 stamp from montana and a couple from california in the 1760s! i loved it!"" i would say, ""i try new hobbies for fun. last year i dabbled in photography, guitar, and dog sitting! i loved it!"" both of us would be having fun doing what we do. person x would never feel bad about him or herself for not trying ""enough"" new things, so why would i ever feel bad about trying ""too many"" new things?! &amp;#x200b; **\*\*tl;dr:\*\*** be kind to yourself. accept that your hobbies will have to be dynamic. instead of trying harder, consider trying differently. reduce the (financial) barriers to exit. and, most importantly, recognize that trying new hobbies \*is\* a hobby! godspeed, mateys. happy hobbying!"

depression,bipolar,354,"kinda shitty advice. but i'll start with some backstory. i'm on mobile so forgive me. (this will be kinda rambly) i was diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety disorder after i checked into a psychiatric hospital a few years back, but i always felt as i grew up that something was wrong. when i went to go meet my biological mother (who is very bipolar) when i was 18 things started to click with me that i needed to figure out a way to find meaning. it didn't help that my step-mom was an abusive cunt. so overall i kinda suck at being a person.(still do) anyways, i've struggled with constantly feeling down, and also feeling a whole lotta shit i didn't really understand. because of this i turned to weed and alcohol when i was 15. went through a few phases of drinking hard, but really weed was my poison of choice(still dont think it's bad but that's for another sub). again anyways because of the plant i kinda regained a sense of what it meant to be a healthy functioning member of society, but it was  pay the rent, things get complicated with family, with work, with life. and all of it together makes me wanna opt out. but then i think of leaving him by himself to deal with it himself and what a living hell that would be. even if i cant do much, ill do what i can till i can't. because if i dont that would make me sadder than anything i can ever encounter in my life. my point is that out there there are strong, amazing, incredibly intelligent and driven people, who do this shit alone. while feeling everything. and its heart breaking. my dad spent his life trying to make me feel welcome when every fiber of my being says i don't belong on this earth. the least i can do is gtfo bed and try to do something. even if my battle that day is just to brush my teeth. so that he can see a good looking smile that he made. to make him feel just a little better. that's my part, my mission. thats what gets me up. there are people that can use your help, and you owe it to them. but that s just my opinion."

anxiety,adhd,357,"when i was about 12 (25 years ago), i used to have this group of friends that i would go out to lunch with to restaurants near school on half days. one day at school, i overheard this one guy who was in the same group ask another guy in the group if i was going to lunch that day. the other guy said no, and the first guy said ""good, because raingodofmorning is so annoying."" then he turned around and saw me, and gave some half-hearted, awkward, non-apology. i've never really gotten over this, and i have a fear of hanging out with people and them secretly wishing i wasn't there because i'm so annoying, but me never knowing about it. and i actually think that i might be pretty annoying to be around. my brain works really, really fast and i have anxiety and adhd, so i talk fast and i cawe should get dinner sometime"" that sounded like the clichéd thing people say when parting, regardless of whether they mean it. this is something i've identified as an external clue (as in, not something from my own head) that they might also find me annoying. i'm not quite sure if i should work on: (a) just accepting that i am an annoying person and being okay with keeping my contact with others limited in order to avoid inadvertently thrusting myself upon a social group one too many times, or (b) if i should work on convincing myself that i'm not annoying, even if it isn't really true. (i do see a therapist. this is one of many issues we work on, but it is very slow going). anyone with similar experiences? any thoughts/advice/opinions (that fit within the rules of this community)?"
adhd,anxiety,359,"i failed a biochemistry test today. i knew i needed to study on time and i actually did start a few weeks ago. i had plenty of time to sit down and study for this very important test that would help me keep my grades up this semester. instead, i let my anxiety get the better of me - i stayed up all night, cycling between panic and apathy. i couldn't even sit through my therapy session today. this is on top of a bioethics paper that is now a day late. every year of college, i've started out strong only to crash and burn by the end of the semester. things have gotten better after my adhd diagnosis but this. keeps. happening. and after this morning's test, i **refuse** to let the anxiety and depression consume me. despite the fact i will most likely not get the high gpa i was hoping for this semester, i will not let that deter me from finishing at least in a decent spot, with my head held high. this is my plan: * after posting this, i will nap, shoto not only look for resources (suggestions welcome!) that can help me but to also start practicing using them and seeing what works (want to start studying for my classes next semester and work on my thesis). this set-back will most likely change my plans for med school. i also have to prepare myself for the interrogation/scrutiny/abuse hurled at me from my parents. i have to stay strong. my path may be different and longer than others but i will keep trying to pursue my dreams while also having back-up plans as well. thank you for reading. this is mostly to hold me accountable but i'll admit, i could use a bit of encouragement or friendly words. i can't turn to my parents for support, i have only one friend who i can confine in with these matters (but i don't want to burden her), and i'm... disappointed at myself right now. i need to hold it together but i am upset. if anyone else is also struggling with things right now, i'm also here for you."
bipolar,depression,369,she's still an infant and i'm already worried that she knows that mommy is going through the motions some days. i try to keep doing our regular activities but it is so hard to smile and look and act enthusiastic. i'm just so tired and sad and i'm not sure i'm giving her what she needs. i'd love to hear your advice and experiences.
bipolar,depression,374,"i've been feeling needy and ignored lately, the thing is i'm not interacting with anyone really outside my so. it's too much to handle right now. and my so gives me cuddles and is being helpful. there is really no one to ignore me, you know? but i just feel bad for some reason. i can't figure it out. i'm even upset when people don't reply or upvote my posts and that is really weird because i don't usually notice votes. i ruminate over whether i said the wrong thing or upset someone. i don't always reply to people i've gone into crisis i managed. i dunno, i felt a little weird after a session a few weeks ago. kinda like emdr weird and the session was kinda an unconscious exploring one, not emdr but a different therapy. i keep going back to that. i am left with just vague feelings i don't understand and just feeling uneasy. this is really bugging me. i keep expecting it to resolve, but when i'm resting or taking a time out to recharge it's really on my mind. and i feel unusually sensitive of late,since that weird appointment."
bipolar,depression,377,"like many of you, when i get depressed i tend to stay in my room, unshowered, and pass the days bingeing on netflix, hulu or amazon prime. i canceled netflix so i could afford movie pass. (i'm on a fixed income.) it's a subscription service that allows you to see one movie a day, every day, for $10 a month. (this is not an advertisement, just an idea. i don't work for movie pass.) i spoke to my private showing. so maybe if you're like me and love movies, a subscription service may be the thing to help you leave the house. amc theaters also has a subscription service for $20 a month if you can afford that. (this is in the us). sinema has plans starting at $4.99 a month. if you love movies and want to have a motivation to leave the house once in a while, this may be a good idea for you."
depression,bipolar,379,"my life sucks now and has always sucked. i've always struggled with depression, bipolar and self harm and awful social anxiety. waking up and thinking about all the years ahead, makes me absolutely exhausted in a way that sleep can't even touch. i realized the other day.. i don't wanna be alive, but i also don't want to die. i feel like there's a chance later on, my life could be amazing. a husband &amp; family, a job, ect.. and if i died, i'd never get to experience what i want so bad. so for now, i guess i'll keep doing what i'm doing and hope something changes and just keep hope. anyone else ever felt this way?"
adhd,bipolar,383,"my dog likes to sit on the mat i keep by my back door, so i brought it with me to his obedience class last night. i remember putting the mat back in my bag after class. i remember putting the bag in the car. i remember dropping the bag in the garage before taking the dog for a walk. i remember putting the empty bag away. i looked all over the garage, the house, the car, and i have no freaking clue where the doormat went. i have lost many things. i have never before lost a doormat. tl/dr: who the fuck loses a doormat?!?"
anxiety,depression,384,"so i am starting to venture out of the house after having a very hard time leaving my 2 floor walkup apartment for almost a year now. tonight i accomplished getting to my favorite bookstore which is just around the corner for the first time since last spring! and guess what? here's what happened: i didn't faint. i didn't die. i didn't let lightheadedness/dizziness/for my husband who is my soul mate and best friend! (couldn't have done it without him!) recently, i started pushing myself to get outside more and more every day. today was a major milestone! spoke to people on the street. got myself some gifts. felt like my ""old self"". super freaking refreshing. just wanted to share w y'all that there is hope for us and the world!"
anxiety,depression,385,"there was this kid when my husband and i went to see a movie yesterday that would not stop talking. he would talk every 5 minutes about what was happening or what new character came on screen... and i could tell that others around me were annoyed as well. his parents said nothing to him. it took me two hours to mentally prepare myself, but i looked behind me and asked him to please stop talking. he said ""okay, sorry"" and he actually stopped! i'm so proud of myself, usually i'm not confident enough to do something like that."
adhd,depression,390,"for example, there’s so many items and guns left behind in places you raid in fallout and i just can’t leave the place without literally doing every side thing, killing every guard and getting the best equipment. what happens from that is it takes me ages to play the game which leads me to give up without finishing the story line. sorry mods if this is a faq or common post, i just am bad at researching lol"

ptsd,anxiety,418,"the other day i or i should say we went on a 1st date with a woman i had just met a couple of days earlier. i say we, because my service dog was with me. after we had eaten, we were just chatting when all of sudden my dog jumps up and starts licking me. this is what she does when i start getting amped up. didn't train her to do it, she just does i had to get out of there. i could not sit still. i don't remember everything after the anxiety exploded. i don't remember driving home. i just couldn't think straight. i was short of breath. my heart was pounding. it had been such an amazing date up until that point. has anyone been thru anything similar?"
ptsd,anxiety,427,"like it says, something feels wrong. i can taste in my mouth that something isn't right. it's as if i'm looking at everything through a different light, like my mind is seperate from my body. i feel all these signals going off in my head, that tell me to run and to leave. my brain is filled with all these screaming noises. not voices, not people telling me to do things, but it's as if every thought i have is being screamed throughout my head. i can feel in my chest that something is wrong, it's not anxiety, it's my heart pumping so loud. it feels like something very bad is about to happen."
ptsd,depression,428,"too much horrible shit has happened to me in the past few weeks. one of the things i can't tell my parents. i have been going around house to house staying with other people because i want to avoid my parents. due to my other mental health issues, i still live at home at age 27 (i know,pathetic) and i feel like i can't be around them rig bitch to me. didn't care that i couldn't sleep. i had to go to the e.r. (i have medicaid) to get sleeping pills that actually work because she wouldn't return my call after giving my trazedone, which doesn't even work. i'm so angry at everyone. even my therapist who i told my problem to, i don't think he takes me seriously. i'm so tired."

adhd,depression,433,"video games, weed, watching porn, eating fatty foods, drinking, etc. these are all things i find very hard to control. when i smoke a bit of weed i crave more instantly and i don't stop smoking until i'm baked out of my mind. whenever i'm feeling bad i start overeating, which leads to me feeling worse, which leads to more overeating. whenever i feel bored (which is quite often) i play video games. this leads to me using only video games for pleasure and to esccult emotions, and i dull myself with unhealthy behaviours, instead of just accepting the emotions and processing them in a healthy way. when i stop using these behaviours the negative thoughts and emotions start hitting me very hard. but probably that's just a phase you have to go through, to get out better on the otherside. are there others who struggle with balancing life like me? if you've found a solution, please elaborate. is this just a discipline thing?"
anxiety,depression,435,i feel drained and exhausted. every day. even when i exercise. i'm so lonely but no one ever hangs out with me or talks with me. most of my friends left and now i'm back to where i started. :/ i feel guilty to and idk why. i've never experienced this type of sadness before
bipolar,adhd,439,"i have been struggling so much to take this exam for my mba program. the course material was truly terrible, but i also just... couldn't face it. i had no confidence. i was avoiding it at all costs. well last night i did it! i sucked it up, scheduled my exam, and nailed it. i have a little bit more work to do, but i am now extremely close to finishing my masters degree and i just have to ride this wave to the end."

adhd,bipolar,457,"for anyone suffering and on the fence about it, give it even more serious thought. also this might be a bit of an overreaction seeing as its just the first fucking day but if this is how things are normally going to be then yeah; i should have done this ages ago. when i went on academic probation after my first year of college my mother told me that i should consider going back on it and would pay for it. i declined; citing that i did not want to be on the medication for my whole life and that i didn't want my success to be thanks to a pill. prideful. i did not want to be seen as ""weak"" needing medication just to focus on things that people did so easily. fast forward almost two years. i got my associates at a community college, but barely. my gpa was just a hair below 2.5, preventing me from transferring. i did land a job that paid well and i enjoyed. i had it for a year before hitting 3 strikes and being let go. 1st strike was because i went to fast and didn't double check something. 2nd strike was honestly just me not clocking in during the window before shift started. several of these tardies were over because i would get carried away talking to my co-workers about what needed to be done before shift (i had an odd job and this was required. i showed up 10-15 minutes early each shift). i would clock in after the buzzer rang, reminding me. 3rd strike was because of repeated problems in just failing to do certain things after being told to so. if i didn't writeted*. like the world is open to me now. literally every teacher i've had has mentioned that i should be doing a lot better than i am right now. every employer has praised my skills and work ethic but bemoaned on how i might solve problems other can't, but stumble on the simple things we do every day. today is a turning point. things will not be the same. the world had better watch out, because i don't think its prepared for /u/replieswithanimegif on medication. thank you to /r/adhd, and your wiki in particular. reading through the wiki was an eye opening experience that convinced me that i wasn't weak/broken/whatever. i had an issue. there was a solution. i realized that i was what i criticized often; someone refusing to acknowledge the answer when its staring right in front of them. thank you for helping me confront my pride and shove the answer in their face. tl;dr /r/adhd wiki is amazing. after two years of getting very little done academically and losing my job over add issues i've finally swallowed what to me was a bitter pill. if today is any indication, this is the beginning of major beneficial change. for the first time in a long time, i'm going to go to sleep without the thought of all the things i didn't get done tormenting me and making me feel inadequate. at least if adderall doesn't fuck up my sleep too much since i took it at like 1pm. thankfully my old job had me up till 12am anyways and i often don't get to sleep until 2 or 3am. here goes nothing."
adhd,depression,461,"i find myself going silently insane whenever people are talking to me for any length longer than 10 seconds, even friends/loved ones. it feels like an eternity listening to them ramble on even if they were only speaking for a minute. i get fixated on the sound of peoples lips moving and it feels like there are bugs crawling inside my body and it makes me want to scream. my gf has told me she always feels like i'm just waiting for her to stop talking, and i hate myself for doing this to her. even though i am listening to every word she says, it feels like i'm being crushed under a wall of words. has anyone else had this problem? or found any solutions to help it? edit: i'm perscribed vyvanse 50 mg/daily"

depression,anxiety,525,"that’s the best i can explain how i feel, i guess. it’s odd, but the only thing i’ve felt for a while now, so is strangely comforting due to its consistency. i feel as if i’m very detached from my own body, and am sometimes taken aback when i see myself ieverything (sometimes called creepily observant). i don’t know how to describe it, really. justa constant star of being “out of it”. i was just curious if anyone else feels the same way? let me know if you do and we can try and explain it to each other :)"

depression,bipolar,537,"i was on dope for 3 years. i now have the realisation i was on it to block out all the problems i had, when i was on it, nothing mattered. i had no friends, no life, no happiness, nothing. i went through 5 days of physical withdrawal; anxiety, shaking, sweating, puking, headaches, etc. pure fucking hell. but nothing prepared me for what i would encounter after: everything i my point is, is youve established the problems with your life, start working on them immediately. don't waste time. it's worth it. i know what it's like, each day just not having the energy or drive to do anything at all. but please make a plan to do so in the meantime. i'm working hard on it. if i can, anyone can. take care, all of you. i believe in every single one of you"

ptsd,depression,754,"it’s ironic and frustrating, because i spend 99% of the time hyper-vigilant and on edge, but when i’m in a situation that actually could be dangerous, suddenly i become naive and trusting and vulnerable. i look back on times when i trusted somebody who in hindsight i absolutely should not have trusted, i just apparently ignored the million red flags, and i gave out personal information that i shouldn’t have, and potentially seriously endangered myself. i never realize what happened until i look back on it afterwards and i feel like a complete idiot."
bipolar,depression,758,"does anyone get in depressions so low that you feel like you are practically evil from all the guilt and stuff that you feel? i have serious mood episodes with my hormones/periods, for example, and can go from a little depressed, fine, or even happy to ""i should not exist on this planet, and don't want to be alive"" really quickly. i don't even trust myself, and think i am a monster. it is rough and even if i prepare myself for it or tell myself it's because i am depressed, nothing touches it. my entire world feels dark and closing in. i don't even want help at these points, because i ""know"" i do not deserve it. just wondering who else experiences this and what can be done to keep yourself somewhat grounded or something."
anxiety,depression,762,"i went out clubbing with friends and this time, i decided to just say to hell with it...i spent all night talking to whoever i wanted to talk to, dancing with whoever i wanted to dance with, and it was amazing. normally i would be so shy when it comes to approaching people i don't know, but...nobody shot me down for approaching them and whatever fear i might've had about it basically went away all in one night. i'm on cloud nine."

adhd,none,786,"i often have people bring up songs/albums/bands or movies/tv shows during conversation. they might say, ""have you seen or heard x?"" and if i have i will say ""yeah, i liked it, enjoyed it etc etc etc"". however, as soon as they go into more details such as band members or actor names, favourite lines from movies or lyrics from songs i can't actually remember any information beyond a couple of bits even though i know i've seen/heard it and i liked it. i fear it makes me appear as a compulsive liar who says they like things just to fit in when in reality i just cannot remember many details, lines, names or lyrics, just i enjoyed said movie/show/album etc. anyone else get this? feelsbadman.jpeg."

bipolar,depression,830,"came across this and thought they may be useful for anyone suffering from mild depression: does anyone religiously do cbt and if so did it help? **common cognitive distortions** a partial list from robert l. leahy, stephen j. f. holland, and lata k. mcginn’s [*treatment plans and interventions for depression and anxiety disorders*] (2012) 1. **mind reading** you assume that you know what people think without having sufficient evidence of their thoughts. “he thinks i’m a loser.” 2. **fortune-telling** you predict the future negatively: things will get worse, or there is danger ahead. “i’ll fail that exam,” or “i won’t get the job.” 3. **catastrophizing** you believe that what has happened or will happen will be so awful and unbearable that you won’t be able to stand i feel now,” or “my parents caused all my problems.” 10. **what if?** you keep asking a series of questions about “what if” something happens, and you fail to be satisfied with any of the answers. “yeah, but what if i get anxious?,” or “what if i can’t catch my breath?” 11. **emotional reasoning** you let your feelings guide your interpretation of reality. “i feel depressed; therefore, my marriage is not working out.” 12. **inability to disconfirm** you reject any evidence or arguments that might contradict your negative thoughts. for example, when you have the thought i’m unlovable, you reject as irrelevant any evidence that people like you. consequently, your thought cannot be refuted. “that’s not the real issue. there are deeper problems. there are other factors.”"

ptsd,anxiety,833,"you know how sometimes something just happens and you never talk about it with anyone, and it just feels like it never happened, like it's not real. ""oh yes that happened once its totally fine and normal to have panic attacks when thinking about it"" i never realised that it was a bad thing, until i told her. and i realised how hard it was to talk about it. i realised how horrible it sounded. when i said it out loud, when i heard it, it sounded so traumatic, even though it seemed so mundane and normal to me in my head. i guess i should give some insight: my cousin is like 26 and a psycho. he raped my aunt, who is 7 years younger than him, when she was a teenager (she's like a sister to me so i want to strangle him) when i was 12, he barged into our house (my dumbass grandma let him in cause ""he's a wonderful man""). my aunt was there too, trying to get him to leave. he made a huge scene, started crying because his girlfriend left him or something, telline back. i think i made all the excuses in the world and speedwalked the fuck outta there. he was shouting after me, asking me what the fuck i think i'm doing. luckily, i was close to my house, so he didn't have much time to chase after me. i got to my house, and my aunt hugged me because she was so worried. we didn't talk about it after that when i told my therapist, she made me realised that he was an actual predator, actually targeting me. i had other instances of him touching me at family reunions (as alabama as that sounds) and now that i know that it actually happened and it was a bad thing, i don't know how to feel. i don't really talk to my family (emotional neglect and occasional abuse) so that was the first time i had an authority figure validate my experiences. sorry if this isn't the right sub, i don't know if this is real ptsd or if i'm just being dumb again, sorry, just needed to type it. i hate how he gets away with everything all the time"

ptsd,bipolar,916,"i find it hypocritical that i am sometimes called a crazy person or a freak when i tell others that i suffer from a mental disorder, while in fact, the entire world is like a planet sized mental institution with various levels of crazy. it's just that ... some forms of craziness are more acceptable than others i find it funny that the enitre world is full of crazy, and then people who are reading this os posting on this tread for help and compassion becuase we unfortunately have to through some pretty harsh and intense mental battles ... they have the luxury to call **us** crazy **edit** ... i'm sorry ... maybe crazy is too much of a strong word. maybe weird is better - we have plenty of academic fields which have their own levels of weirdness *(some of them are truly more weird than others with abstract theories and assumptions that some people still beleive like left-handed people are criminals or pathological people)* - on this year, we were shown what extreme measures some world leaders are willing to do to get what they want. discrimion - we are now, in some way, slaves of social media. wanting to post plenty, sometimes even, unnecessary posts to please others because we don't want to feel alone or rejected or even ostracized by others becuase of how the internet often involves a lot of clickbait and using it for drama or even discriminating or humiliating others becuase we simply can and then, when someone knows that i have to go through a variety of mental battles which have affected by a number of factors, could be social like my past experiences or could be biological like genetics or could be internal like a part of personality that making me act in neurotic ways ... .... but still ... i am the one who is treated as this so-called **""freak""** and probably the same treatment for many other people around the world. *(i'm sorry if this hurt you. i just wanted to get this out of my chest)* *(also, sorry if there are my grammatical errors ... i have no idea why but my mental disorders affects my language skills. i don't know why or how but it annoys me and i apologise)*"
bipolar,depression,922,"i have lied to my friends and family for a very long time. it goes beyond the ""how are you?"" and ""fine, thank you"" dialogue. i lived with a smile on my face and i told myself that i was strong. i recently had an episode where i couldn't fake it anymore. i became really really sick. and now, the people i love are asking me questions because theyd never hurt her like that. my mom looked so shocked. i want to keep lying and putting up a face. but the truth is that i'm exhausted and really tired of acting like someone i'm not. and i know that my family and friends are asking questions because they want to understand and help me, but i want them to continue seeing me as ""smiley joojoobar."""
depression,adhd,924,"no special occasion. i just had a tough day at work so i picked up a big bunch of tulips on the way home. not the cheap ones either, but the lovely fresh perfectly blooming crisp and colorful kind. ""what's the big deal?"" you're probably thinking. the big deal is that there was a time in the not so distant past that the thought of ""treating myself"" to anythiat instant noodles when i'm alone and having a bad day because it's a waste of time to cook just for me. but today i showed myself a little kindness. i acknowledged the fact that i work damn hard and i am great at my job. i have value and i am valued. tulips are beautiful and so am i. i deserve to have beautiful things in my life because i am a badass bitch."
anxiety,depression,926,"i feel like i've cried a dozen times since hearing about it, watching parents speak on the news and reading tweets from the kids who went to school there (including some who were horribly killed). for some reason, i'm really affected by things happening to children and young people. i feel so emotional and distraught thinking about what they must have gone through in those moments of the shooting, and how their families now must feel... i'm not sure why it affects me so much. i'm sure like everyone else i strongly believe children should be protected and put first no matter what so things like this are just... so unspeakable. i hope the gun laws in america change for the sake of school children."
anxiety,depression,927,"i was sitting at the doctors waiting for my husband to finish when the 700 club came on the tv talking about how jesus healed mental and physical disabilities. i thought about just going to the car, but i finally asked about changing the tv. unfortunately they just gave me the remote and some older people had just sat down looking directly at the tv. i wanted to change it to cnn but was afraid of them labeling me as a young liberal listening to fake news. so i changed it to local news. so now listening to a million commercials, but none of them claiming i can be cured by allowing jesus into my heart. but i did it!! i'm really proud of myself."
bipolar,depression,932,because any kind of sickness is more tolerable than depression when it gets bad. i feel guilty for being around others when i might be contagious but it's what i have to do.
ptsd,depression,933,"this week has been god awful, but finding this sub and being able to relate / not feel so alone is really helpful and i’m really happy that this community exists."
adhd,bipolar,934,today i almost feel like... manic? i don't want to minimize what it's like to have an actual manic episode but goodness gracious my mind is racing. and i cannot focus on anything and feel like need to do something crazy. (more than i usually do hahaha)
ptsd,depression,939,"i had a few very traumatic events happen to me over the course of about 3 years. as a result, i really don’t trust in anything or anyone anymore. i managed to get married and really do trust my partner, but not anyone else. i just moved across the country and i’m findien through to harm me. it gets really exhausting because i’m really lonely here since i don’t know anybody which exacerbates my depression. it’s like, i have the desire to try and make friends but what i’ve been through just won’t let me. it’s such an isolating feeling."
none,adhd,942,"i constantly bump into different strange uses of ""would"" that i just can't understand. for example ""i tried to unlock the front door, but the door wouldn't open"" this is a situation that happened in finished in the past. this is not a hypothetical situation. ""would"" here doesn't mean a habitual past action. ""would"" here doesn't express willingness to do something. isn't it supposed to be ""i tried to unlock the front door but the door didn't open"". whyyyyy?"
ptsd,adhd,949,sensory goods. i bought one from them a few years ago and it’s great. im buying a second one for my grandson. they talked me into glass beads. i think it’s sand actually. this time i ordered it with plastic beads. then i’ll take whichever he doesn’t prefer. i hope it helps someone. anyways-here’s the code i just used. 20% off and free shipping. fb20
anxiety,depression,951,"came across news this morning that hip hop celebrity kid cudi checks himself into rehab for depression and suicidal thoughts. he wrote this letter to his fans where anxiety is mentioned. just wanted to say that none of us are alone in our fight with anxiety. here is the letter: ""its been difficult for me to find the words to what im about to share with you because i feel ashamed. ashamed to be a leader and hero to so many while admitting i’ve been living a lie. it took me a while to get to this place of commitment, but it is something i have to do for myself, my family, my best friend/daughter and all of you, my fans. yesterday i checked myself into rehabima get through this. i wont be around to promote much, but the good folks at republic and my manager dennis will inform you about upcoming releases. the music videos, album release date etc. the album is still on the way. promise. i wanted to square away all the business before i got here so i could focus on my recovery. if all goes well ill be out in time for complexcon and ill be lookin forward to seeing you all there for high fives and hugs. love and light to everyone who has love for me and i am sorry if i let anyone down. i really am sorry. ill be back, stronger, better. reborn. i feel like shit, i feel so ashamed. im sorry. i love you, scott mescudi"
anxiety,depression,954,"tired of knowing who i am, but not what i want to be. tired of society deciding where i should be at in life and what i should be doing. tired of feeling like all i've done is waste my time not knowing what to do. tired of being told to make a difference in the world. tired of feeling lied of looking at others achievements and feeling perpetually inferior. tired of feeling like i'm in some race that i'm losing. tired of self doubt. tired of this never-ending cycle. i'm exhausted and i don't know what to do about it. does anyone else feel this way? if so, what did you do?"
anxiety,depression,967,"the older i get, the worse i seem to be at, i don't know, functioning in general. i used to be really sociable, have plenty of friends, i did well in school, had hobbies and interests - i was weird, but enough people liked me that i didn't think about it. after high school it was like the blinders were taken off and i started to see all these things about myself that i really, really hated. i started struggling a lot in social situations, i flunked out of a really good university, i couldn't hold a job, i gradually lost contact with my friends... i was a mess. but i got back up. it was a little harder than before but i still had enough momentum to keep going. i moved back to my ollet myself become. i think a big part of my problems is that i'm so used to trying and failing that i'm afraid that's the only outcome if i try again. i look at myself and think ""i've given up,"" because i have. i don't want to! but i don't know how to make life work for me anymore. i don't know how to connect with people. i go out somewhere and it's impossible to think or talk clearly through the static in my head that makes me nauseous and stutter and my heart pound. what kind of a life is one where you can't even talk to someone without turning into an idiot or crying after? i can't function like this. i'll never be able to work like this. has anyone overcome a similar situation?"
bipolar,adhd,968,"but i kept having spoonfuls of honey? i guess that wasn't enough calories how come we don't have much of an appetite when in elevated states? i've heard this happening to others too. although, once i eat something, i remember i'm actually hungry, and want more. but it's easy to forget for a rather long time.."
anxiety,depression,971,"i just got hired for a job that pays pretty well, and the hours are well-suited for me, working about 4-6 hours per day, and i am super happy about it because i quit many jobs because of its long hours, and i hope this one last and that i wouldn't have any attacks at work!"
bipolar,depression,974,"you are climbing a mountain, it's hell, you want to give up , you push on and when you finally think you can't take another step, someone passes you on the way back down and tells you it's just 5 more minutes. a grueling ten minutes pass, you collapse on a rock and drop your pack. you see the summit. you lie on the ground for ten more minutes trying to shake out the last drops of water from the bottle into your mouth and they dribble down your face instead. you brought double the water everyone else did and it wasn't enoughiew was beautiful, you should see the view from the peak, it's amazing, so worth the trip, and you go wtf. you know night will come eventually, climbing up that mountain, never reaching the ""summit"", uncertain of how many hours you have left. only that night will come and then the struggle will end. stop making false promises that ""it will get better"". stop asking me to believe in fairytales. i don't want another false hope only to be shattered again like a glass falling to hard floor. i am so tired of picking up the pieces."
adhd,depression,979,thank you to this [wonderful who went waaaay out of their way to try and hurt my feelings but ended up turning a bad day into a good one because it reminded me that some people have it worse. there are people out there who only feel good when they make others feel bad and those are the people to feel truly sorry for. i'm so flattered that they saw me as a target :)
anxiety,depression,988,"i feel like i've become a shit ton better as a person, but there are those nights that make me relive all those bad moments and i beat myself up so much that i get seriously messed up. what i wouldn't give to go back and do it all over the right way again..that way, i might've made better friends who would've lasted through maybe? or maybe these experiences, they've made me better as a person? they've shaped me? i dont know at this point."
adhd,depression,994,"sorry if the word offends anyone, but it’s the most blunt honest way to describe how i feel sometimes. i feel like i’m retarded. i have pretty bad attention deficiency, to the point where i feel like my brain is shutting down at times like a windows xp computer. i just can’t converse with people normally, i feel like a robot with every self conscious movement i make, i drop shit and accidentally break shit all ong with me. even putting this post together felt mentally exhausting and i feel like it probably doesn’t even make sense :(. is there anybody else who feels like this? is there anyway to cope (without needing to take my adderall)? i try to stay as hydrated as possible if that helps my case. thank you all in advance, i’m glad to have a place where i can come to where there’s people who have similar issues as me."
anxiety,depression,998,"tomorrow i bury my best friend who tragically passed away at the age of 25. i'm heartbroken and i will be speaking at his funeral. i am happy with the speech but i am nervous, petrified to mess up. he was an incredible guy and i want to send him off well, justify what he meant to me. my ex who broke up with me 2 months ago has kept contact to ask how i have been doing and if i ever needed anything go to her. i went to the gym yesterday evening just to pass the time and maybe work off a small hangover i was nursing from the night before. i felt okay but by the end of my session i was very tired. as i was walking back towards my flat i spot my ex with a guy next to her sitting down. i could have turned around but i didn't. i go up to her and say hi, she seems shocked to see me and asks if i'm doing okay. i say no, not really and say i'll leave them to it and say goodbye. as i walk down the road my ex has caught up with me after she runs to catch up with me. she says she has done this to tell me thatuy who has a family that makes her laugh, feel alive. this guy has a child. i recognise him from her xmas party. i'm really confused about why she chased after me. it's obvious she cares but is she feeling guilty, trying to spare my feelings in the hardest time of my life. i do want her back in my life but seeing her with another guy hurt big time. seeing them close to each other eating ice cream. she works with him, did she like him when we were dating. i also hate the idea of her sharing her sympathy and support with other people, especially a guy like that. and it hurts to hear her say to me he's going through a hard time. i'm going through the hardest time of my life. i feel like i can't use her as a crutch. i'm so confused, hurt, a mess. i bury my best friend tomorrow . i am absolutely terrified. i feel sick, like i'm going to mess up and ruin everything. the last 2 months has been the worst of my life, it just has. i want things to be better. i want him back. i want her back. i feel terrible."
anxiety,depression,1001,"you are not the boss of me. had i written this two days ago i would have said, ""you win; i surrender."" you took my thoughts and turned them against me. forcing me to question my actions and my trajectory. making me look negatively at everything thatch time i forget about everything and you come to the forefront. you are so clever but your days are numbered. just remember that i am doing the work. you are here because i am here and i will continue to be here. so buckle up and take all the seats!"
adhd,depression,1006,"as far back as i remember i have burnt out every couple of months and had to take a mental health day. this morning, a fairly normal work day for me, i canceled all the commitments i could though it'll make my week harder going forward. i lied to my supervisor about being sick and i'm working from home. i'm not nearly as productive at home, therefore i'll feel guilty and work harder all week due to feeling guilty for skipping out of my responsibilities. i just get his overwhelming feeling that i can't handle the day and it feels so random and i'll just melt down. i even did this in high school. is this, by chance, an adhd thing or maybe a depression thing? life just feels hard and i don't get why or how other people have so mucgh energy for it. ha."
adhd,depression,1007,"and told her i don’t even remember what people who talked to me minutes ago were wearing. i almost never do. clothes are boring. idgaf about clothes. if you give me thousands of subjects to spend time thinking about, clothes would be like the last one. is it serious that people care so much about small physical details? i can’t believe it."
ptsd,depression,1012,"i know it's only september but i'm already feeling it, especially with halloween advertising everywhere already. usually go see in-laws but don't know if i can handle that at all this year...."
ptsd,depression,1022,i can't function. i have a test in the morning and a final exam thursday that i won't be attending. she ran away and got hit by a car and died. i don't know how i'm going to go on. i can't live without her.
ptsd,depression,1023,i understand that it says more about them but i can’t help but feeling pain whenever i see yet another person that shows deliberate apathy towards me. everyone in my family and everyone i thought was my friend have been narcissistic. incapable of empathy.
bipolar,depression,1025,"it doesn't seem to be related to depression. i don't feel depressed, i just feel really in need of sleep. the only problem here is that i'm soon to be employed again and i know i won't be able to just do this whenever i want. but it feels like ... a necessity, like going to the bathroom or something. my body just takes over and i need that sleep. does this happen to anyone else? how do you navigate it?"
adhd,depression,1028,"also, stop procrastinating on reddit. is there a small first step of something that you should be doing right now? go do it. wait. no. don't read ""just one more post."" go directly from this to the thing you're dreading. just do 60 seconds of something productive towards it. feel better? keep going. you got this :)"

adhd,depression,1034,...and you still waste your fucking time on your phone and only end up doing some of it at least it's better than nothing but yeah this was me the other day. i stayed up all night at my work to catch up on things that i'm way behind in
adhd,anxiety,1038,"picking up on people's emotions, mood changes, body language, reactions that other people don't notice. that has always been a thing i'm proud of, actually. but it has it's disadvantages. i'm extremely aware of people's moods, which can catch me of guard and mess with my confidence. like during driving lessons, the slightest annoyance from my teacher for doing something wrong i would pick up on, and it would negatively influence me. (even though she's hiding it; she isn't saying any, suddenly noticed to my mom ""he's not okay, something's off"". my mom didn't see/ notice anything, but i was right and my rabbit died that night. i was just wondering if any of you experience this? because i feel like it's not a common adhd/add sign but it has a big impact on my life and more negative than positive because i am too aware of people's feelings which makes me ""overly considerate"". it's like walking on eggshells. still add is the only actual diagnose i have, so i wonder."
ptsd,anxiety,1041,"so long story short, recently i’ve been noticing i have more stomach troubles. vomiting, diarrhea, etc. yesterday i had another “stomach bug” but i noticed as soon as i was home it started to go away. it started after this guy was too close to me and was being generally creepy. i almost shit myself in a mcdonald’s and threw up as well on my way home. the last time this happened, a man had gotten too close to me and i almost threw up in my car on the way home. does anyone else experience this? is this something i should tell my psychiatrist?"
bipolar,anxiety,1045,"sorry for the rambling post. i just need a safe place to vent. i'm pretty much losing it. i haven't been to work all week because i'm crippled with anxiety and i've been super irritable, lashing out, experiencing hallucinations, and have been feeling incredibly suicidal. last night, my fiance had to basically sit on me to make sure i didn't hurt myself. i begged him not to bring me to the hospital. i think i should go to the hospital to get stabilized but i don't know if it will do much good as i know that when i get out i won't be able to afford the medication they'll put me on and i'll be back to square one. i'm sorry. i just feel so overwhelmed right now."
depression,adhd,1048,"does anyone else ever feel like... they aren’t doing things for enjoyment but they’re just doing manual controls of themselves bc they have to? “ okay now it’s time to eat. okay that’s done, now it’s time to lay down. okay that’s done, now it’s time to see your friends” but everything really just feels like you’re going through the motions without any real enjoyment?"
bipolar,depression,1053,"i've been thinking about getting a dog lately. it's probably not smart for a few reasons, not least of which because i'm unemployed and don't know what my future work schedule will be like. there are a lot of unknowns like that. plus, we live in a small one-bedroom apartment. but it would be a very small dog! but i found a shih tzu puppy on craigslist. she's adorable. and i can see curling up with her on the couch, playing with her, walking her, washing her, and having fun the whole time. what do you think? i know it's probably better to wait, but i can't help but think i could really get some benefit out of it. edit: i realize this isn't strictly bipolar related, but i figure my bipolar peeps might have something to say about their own experiences with pets."
adhd,depression,1057,"i’m a year away from finishing my undergrad in journalism, after switching from civil engineering my first semester. now i’m getting restless and want to switch to forestry to work as a wildland firefighter in montana. i feel like i get bored way too quickly and will never be satisfied with a career."
bipolar,depression,1058,"i'm just so god damn bored. everyone is congratulating me for doing so well, for finally having my shit together... and i'm so fucking bored. i can feel myself slipping. i did coke for the first time in a long, long time the other week (a very tiny amount), and i haven't been able to think about ogether). i'm currently not working because i saved alot so i didn't have to work over the summer, so i have a fair amount of money in my account, but it needs to last me months. all i want to do at the moment is book a flight and leave. i'm so hopelessly bored and i don't really know what to do."
bipolar,anxiety,1062,"well lady... i run off to different countries, i steal cars, i get drunk, i take drugs, i have sex with strangers, i cut myself, i punch myself in the face, i try to kill myself, i have major anxiety and i’m baseline depressed 3 times a year. does that answer your question?"
adhd,bipolar,1065,"the two are actually quite similar, so i would definitely take a look to make sure that you are going down the right path. it is also called ""emotional dysregulation disorder"" and it includes impulsivity, trouble concentrating, and zoning out. rejection sensitive dysphoria can very easily be confused with a borderline's fear of abandonment. you also lack identity, so you cling onto mental illnesses for your identity and tend to lack values, morals, or goals. it basically gives you the emotional intelligence of a 3-year-old, and you lack object constancy. so basically, you are constantly suspicious and worried about a close person's emotions changing when they aren't constantly talking to you or directly in your area."
ptsd,depression,1068,"long story short, when i was in elementary school, i was bullied relentlessly by a kid much older than me. he used to do all kind of unpleasant shit to me, but what i hated the most was being sat on or held down and tickled until i cried. he was too strong and i was defenseless. i hated it and finally broke down and told my parents. tworld just falls down around me. now, tickling is a fairly common things between families and friends, and i'm living in constant fear of it happening. i know, it seems incredibly strange and i hate talking about it. it's so embarrassing because it seems so trivial to everyone else. i haven't even managed to say it to my therapist yet."
none,adhd,1072,"maybe this way of saying it is fine, but when people ask around and compare test scores, i genuinely believe and want to tell people that they shouldn't focus on what other people scored but focus on themselves and their own work. i don't want to sound too formal or even rude since i am a student. so how should i reply to people asking whatever test mark i received?"
ptsd,depression,1076,"i don't mean for this to be a huge downer, i've just been stuck in this rumination for a while now. even on my best days i feel disconnected and never able to fully live in the moment. i'm worrying about the past or future, i'm overthinking a million different moments and possibilities at once. i'm dissociating li. idk. i just feel like everyone is behind a glass wall can't cross. people are graduating and marrying and forming families and i just feel perpetually lost despite my efforts to get better. i think i just need a bit of hope. i'm trying though, i really am. i'm no longer on rock bottom but it's all just difficult."
ptsd,depression,1078,i really need some support i’m feeling over the edge semi suicidal because i feel like i’m failing at everything. i can’t even make friends. maybe i am just a bad person. maybe everything my ex ever said was true. i just feel like such a failure and just have no enthusiasm to keep fighting. need some encouragement. i have no one.
adhd,depression,1080,every single day it's the same. i'm 2 minutes late which has me run the way to the train station. it's always those 2 minutes. i hate it. i start hating myself for it. it keeps happening. why? and who else? how do you cope? it's a common pattern btw. also includes deadlines and other things. i'm always the exact amount of time late to make things uncomfortable.
adhd,none,1083,i just got finished with an interview and as the boss was walking me to the door he asked me what kind of music i listen to. i had absolutely no answer. i listen to music every single day. i listen to new bands and artists every day. but yet i don't know what i listen to. i can't recall names or bands or songs or artists or anything. i love all genres too. i just know that when i turn on my spotify playlist something i enjoy will play. anybody else have this? i can listen to an album 100 times and not know what the album name is or what my favorite song off that album is called. it's so frustrating talking to people about music because i can't recall anything.
bipolar,ptsd,1089,i had the worst one of my life tonight. i was psychotic and had a flashback to my attempt. multiple times. my hand was talking to me and telling me bad things. i have 3-4 nightmares a week and they aren't getting better. i don't know why this is happening.
depression,bipolar,1090,i've been in a major depressive episode for the last two years or so and lately i find myself only brushing my teeth maybe once a day and showering only once a week. i was just wondering if anyone else struggles with this at different times during a depressive episode.
anxiety,depression,1094,i’m afraid to try new things and afraid i actually won’t be good enough to do them. i always think people are negatively judging me for not being perfect at everything. anyone else?
depression,bipolar,1095,i can't stand how people these days are patting themselves on the back for spreading awareness about mental health. there is still so much farther to go. we have not made nearly enough progress for complacency.
bipolar,depression,1097,"i've noticed a theme in my negative thoughts about myself in the last year has been a focus on this idea that i'm a failure. it's something i think all too many of you can relate to, and something i hereby challenge you to do with me. i'll do it in the comments so it doesn't overshadow your accomplishments (because i want to hear about them and be proud of you!) or turn into nk of other things i've done i can be proud of, and maybe it'll help us see some of the awesome things you've done in life that you might not appreciate for its level of awesomeness. so...what in life was hard for you that you managed to do anyway? what was something you did that's been hard for other people that wasn't hard for you? what've you worked at? stay awesome, folks."
ptsd,depression,1109,"i have this regularly and destroyed my social life once again a while back. i pushed away all people i love and lost basically every human connection. i feel like i'd just justify my behavior when explaining it to them and manipulate others into giving me another chance when i'll most likely do the same thing all over again in a few month/years. when i'm in such a state, i can't control it. i lose every human feeling and any empathy left in me. i don't think it's ever going to be any other way, so i don't care anymore. i'm starting to think that i should stay in this totally emotionless state just to stop hurting my loved ones."
ptsd,depression,1111,"i find myself wasting so much of my life ruminating on things that always prove to be false, and in retrospect kind of ridiculous. but in the moment it's real. i feel like i spend almost every day arguing against reality, trying to avoid accepting it and i don't fucking understand why. it's exhausting. i know the truth. but each day i wake up and feel like i refuse to believe it. but at the same time i want to accept it so i can get better and move on with my life. for example: some days i convince myself that i am just some sort of psychopath who made up the ""memories"" of my rape because i just have a sick mind, some days i convince myself that i haause i know that's not true, but it's like my mind is fighting so hard not to accept this! i don't know what my problem is. i don't know why it's so hard for me to accept the truth and connect with it. i just want to fucking live my life and stop feeling this way. it's such a waste. i know deep down that having another problem doesn't get rid of the ptsd and the fact that i was raped, but it's like i keep tricking myself and falling into these rabbit hole thought patterns. it's like my brain is so desperate for this not to be true. it doesn't make sense and it makes me feel crazy. please tell me i'm not the only one going through this insane behavior."

bipolar,depression,1122,"ugh, i hate how this time of year means increased social pressure. i hardly have the energy to socialize to begin with, but add all this holiday stuff on top and it wears me the hell out. went to a christmas tree decorating party this afternoon and after an hour i started fantasizing about announcing ""i have a mental illness so parties are very draining to me ... so ... yeah ... thanks so much, but i have to go now."" i did manage to last a couple more hours but now i'm soooo tired. thank heavens my husband understands."

bipolar,anxiety,1129,"monthly appointment with my doctor again. so i was a little worried about feeling this weird ""not caring"" on some things that i usually do. so i brought it up when he asked, is there anything you want to bring out? i told him that i find it strange when i'm supposed to be angered in a situation and i feel like i don't care anymore. i can't figure out the reason why but i just choose automatically to not care. there are also other aspects but it's more difficult to illustrate. so he asked me, is that good or bad? i replied, that's the issue, i don't know. i'm not sure if it is good or bad. i said maybe imm just tired of being stressed. he smiled and i was surprised when he said, then it's good that you are becoming resilient to daily stress."

ptsd,bipolar,1229,"i was 21 at the time, now i'm 22. in may of 2017, i got really sick out of no where. in a matter of 3 days, i went from feeling slightly out of it, to intense thunderclap headaches, pale, body aches, delirium, and ultimately passing out. i didn't want to make a scene or go to the hospital because i was just starting a new full time job, but i had a feeling that i was going to die. i can't really explain that very well, but i just knew deep down that someone was very wrong. at 4am i took an uber to the hospital and when i got there, upon checking my vitals (very low blood pressure and 160 resting heart rate) the nurses helped me onto a wheelchair and wheeled me into a bed in the intensive care unit. at this point, my memory is very groggy but i remember multiple people helping me take my clothes off to change me into a gown, and then doing an ecg on me. they got an iv into me and gave me a valium injection, as well as nausea medicine. i thought that was odd because i didn't feel nauseous at the time. the doctor came in and asked me what was wrong. i just cried and said my head hurt so bad, adn't push me too hard my fist few weeks back (i have a very physical job). now i'm healthier, but i still have a constant fear of getting sick again. i try to explain this to my mom and friends, but they think i'm just being dramatic and a hypochondriac. i don't feel safe anywhere but the hospital. i'm constantly scared. i don't have a fear of death, but knowing that i could easily become diseased and suffer, and leave all that i love behind makes me sad. it makes me sad that people don't understand what i went through. they are not educated on sepsis and think well ""hey, she didn't have cancer"" (my coworker actually said that, and later attributed my sepsis to being a vegetarian). i really don't talk about it a lot, but when i do, i get eye rolls. it's like people think i enjoyed taking a month off work. i constantly suffer from panic attacks now, where i feel dizzy and can't breathe well, but there's not much i can do about that. ativan doesn't help. my body and mind have been through hell and no one understands, or gives a shit. thank you for reading, i just had to get this off my chest."

bipolar,depression,1324,"hey bpr, it's been a minute. i wish i could say i was doing well, but then i'd be lying. i'm okay, i guess? i'm barely on reddit anymore because i have no energy to deal with any aspect of my life outside of work (including my return to finish my last class for college, which will hopefully happen in the next couple months.) i'd been making my job my only priority when it finally hit me the other night... these people do not respect me. when i told them i wanted a different position (that paid less) they didn't listen. and when my coworker started telling me about the stuff they've done to him... that was the final straw for me. i can't do it anymore. am i depressed? i definitely have reason to be.p of this, my uncle just passed from cancer a month ago... just a month after his son died in his sleep (we still don't know what happened there.) but i'm finally getting my life in order. in the past several months i've quit alcohol, klonopin and cigarettes. i paid off all the money i owed my college so i could return. and i pretty much sacrificed my existence just to make that money. what else is new? well, i just turned 30. maybe i feel like i'm a little too old for this... but for the most part, this milestone just makes me want to change things for the better. hope you've all been doing well... i missed you guys. and thanks for those of you who reached out to me... i'm hoping to be around more."

adhd,bipolar,1370,"we all hate waking up and end up getting super alert at night, right? turns out that norephinephrine (one of the major things we are short on because it needs dopamine to make) is probably part of that. it is the thing that helps us become alert, increases steadily through the day, then resets when we sleep. so we wake up, are supet should, *and* norephinephrine helps regulate blood sugar levels, so we're more likely to be hypoglycemic zombies when we wake up in the morning, so we're screwed from multiple directions. ~~yes i have been geeking out researching neurotransmitters, why do you ask? don't worry, i'll have found a new fixation in a few more days :d~~"
anxiety,ptsd,1371,"my anxiety when i first wake up everyday is so strong i struggle to leave my bed. i wake up from a typically sound sleep and get thrown into a shitstorm nearly everyday. i used to have ptsd related nightmares; thankfully those have died down but it sometimes feels like all the anxiety just builds up overnight and needs to get released every morning. i feel plastered to my bed with a racing mind that i can't control. i've tried things like ""you know this will go away in an hour. just ride it out"". i've tried grounding techniques. i've tried different types of weed and different benzos. i'm thinking about doing a small meditation everyday to see how that makes me feel- are there good apps out there i could try?"

bipolar,depression,1380,"my parents aren't bad people, but i don't think they've tried to understand my situation. they seem to just view me as lazy and workshy, because i have been able to do other things, like go across the country getting jobs, and making plans to start on courses and work full time at the same time, and this past weekend i went scuba diving, but i've struggled to find work, and i just left the job i only started last week. maybe they've got their minds stuck on depression and thinking i should be bed bound and unable to do anything, but in reality i have been doing much better since i got sober, and i'm building up to a normal level, i just wasn't ready ford work, but i'm not expecting that to happen. i'm in a grim sort of limbo, i just want to hide in my bed, because i can't stand the way my parents are viewing me right now. i started crying about it all this morning in public, not the actions of a mentally sound person. edit: well getting books in the hope my parents would read them has turned into them yelling at me and one saying they don't want to know, the other saying they've been through it, which he hasn't, not properly clinical depression as far as i know (and i did ask previously about family history) and certainly not bipolar. i'm going to just hide here in my room now. i feel pretty unwelcome."
