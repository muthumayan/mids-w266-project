(yes... i left only for this reason). not my wisest choices... but hey, i was a young mistake 2: being overconfident.. i knew it would be a disaster if i got caught... but that didn't stop me from flaunting coz i was a proud murtaad....(xd). so in my stupidity i let my cousin know that i stopped believing (we were both stoned) mistake 3: trusting the wrong person..after knowing that i was exmoose, my (haafiz stoner) cousin along with my extended family lured me to a bar and caught me there...stupid i know!but i trusted the dude unfortunately... things got really ugly after that... family intervention, less talking, more beating... finally a bakra (sacrificial goat) to realise their violent fantasies... mom tried to stop em, they said it was all her fault... dad was just shocked...couldn't do much the beatings didn't break me... the words did... as i slowly crawled my way to get some water , my aunt spilled it and said ""don't touch the water, your unholy touch will taint it, and we won't be able to drink it"". still makes me sick to this day. i finally knew what it meant to be untouchable. my concussed head could only think of suicide at the time ... so when everyone else was praying grabbed some essentials, 30 bucks and a swiss knife (coz if anyone came after me i'd kill them and then i would've killed myself)... they stopped me before i could leave... then they locked me in the balcony (my home for the next week) consequently... i had to drop out of college, they'd decided i would be going away to a madrassa for 6 months... my life was over, i knew i was never going to recover from this... so the night before i was supposed to leave for the madrassa i decided to run away, to either kill myself in peace or try my luck on the streets.. but this would probably be my only good decision, the reason i'm posting this right now... i decided against running away or commiting suicide. i thought i was a coward for not finding the courage to commit suicide, but it would take only a moment of courage to kill myself... but i would need courage for a lifetime if i were to live... i realised that this was my only shot at life and even if ending it would mean peace, i wanted to see if i could weather the storm and eventually do what i want to do and live a happy life. if it got too dark,this is my redemption arc: so the next morning, they found my stuff at the door and realised i was gonna run away... used that to somehow get through to my parents and didn't have to go away, but instead attend madrassa near my place where i could come home everyday the next four months of madrassa were hell... but the teacher at the place was a great guy... he was willing to listen to my problems and even debate with me.. of course i didn't buy his justification but atleast it we had civilized conversation. got out early from madrassa for good behaviour,got myself a job, did well, got a promotion to another city but parents didn't let me (family pressure).parents agreed to send me back to college but it was late in the semester... so lost 2 years of college if your wondering what happened to my backstabbing hafiz stoner cousin, karma got him, they found out about his colourful behaviour and things got bad for him. things are quite good now... my relationship with my parents is better than before, i'm doing well professionally (until i get back to college). ghosted the extended family, convinced parents how toxic they actually were. this phase would be the middle of my progress montage... i've not exactly made it in life... but i'm getting there, so i'm hopeful these would be the lessons i learnt from my experiences: 1. don't be overconfident and think it's okay to come out of the closet unless you have a backup plan 2. be extra careful who you trust, even your brother (not all) can betray you if they've got something to gain 3. carefully plan all your moves 4. try to gain financial independence as soon as possible and don't try coming out otherwise 5. don't let bad things define who you are, hardship reveals character 6. never lose hope, it all works out itself if you want it 7. time heals, things do get better 8. forgive but never forget 9. patience is your best friend if you've come this far, thank you for reading. just wanted to get things off my chest, hopefully you get to learn something from this. and if you're struggling right now, hang on...things get better only if you believe in yourself. i cant claim that others haven't suffered worse than me... but if i can try coming out of it, so can you good luck if you'd like to read a more detailed version, the links are in the comment section : [part [part [part",none,5

1695928e-cf6f-45d6-a2de-f114a4b96094,tl;dr – godman to tycoon – the untold story of baba ramdev,"context – yesterday in a thread i happened to mention reading this book and a few redditors had suggested doing a tl;dr of the book once i am finished. on the onset if you have the time and resources, i would highly recommend reading the book. it’s published by juggernaut and is available for reading on their app at rs. 80. i have read a few biographies and they can often go either way. this is one of few good biographies i have read, partly due to the caravan magazine style free flow writing rather than meandering on author’s perceptions and also because the subject (baba ramdev) is a fascinating and an intriguing person. it took me three days and essentially three sittings to complete it. the author – priyanka pathak narain is a journalist who used to cover the religion and spirituality section for mint and that is where she begins on this journey. as part of the book she has interviewed over 52 subjects including balakrishna – ramdev’s deputy and owner of 94% of shares of patanjali ayurveda ltd. so here we go * baba ramdev (ram kisan yadav) was born in said alipur in a poor farming family. a sickly child he rather became very obese and was a victim to his father’s frequent violent outbursts. * somewhere in his early 20s, he finds a band of arya samaj workers and is immediately drawn to them. he joined khanpur gurukul where he learnt sanskrit grammar, tended cows, collected alms and met his future deputy-to-be acharya balakrishna * balakrishna is quite into ayurveda and is from haridwar where he befriends **acharya karamveer** – a stoic, soft spoken arya samaj member who had three post graduate degrees in yoga, indian philosophy and vedas. karamveer soon takes balakrishna under his wing and soon ramdev joins them after a controversy. * ramdev learns yoga from karamveer. to propagate yoga to masses they soon take over ownership from **shankar dev**, a patron of kripalu bagh ashram at haridwar. shankar dev wants and only trusts karamveer. but since he is arya samaj member he is not just ready to take sanyas. sensing an opportunity, ramdev steps in. taking sanyas means two things - 1) he can’t keep any formal relations with his family 2) he cannot maintain any material wealth. i am bringing this up of course because this is very important * balakrishna meanwhile sets up divya pharmacy using the license of a silent partner, swami yogananda. balakrishna himself from **nepal** has legal cases against him (still in courst) for forging his high school and other documents to attain a passport. * in early 2000s, aastha and sanskar become household name. the tv guys select ramdev over karamveer because - saffron robes means authenticity. **an interesting story here is that after aastha turned ramdev down, our diligent baba went to sanskar paying rs 1 lakh for a twenty minute slot.** this is also where i learnt that channels like sanskar and aastha don’t earn from advertising but godmen paying them for tv slots to demonstrate their abilities * we all now know the story. ramdev becomes a household name, not only to nauli kriya or churning of the stomach but also his personality, self-depreciating humor and showmanship * soon ramdev has friends at high places. **mulayam singh, nd tiwari from congress, sudarshan agarwal – ex up governor.** so when they are charged with sales tax fraud, sudarshan agarwal mounts immense pressure on sales tax deputy commissioner to drop the case and retire. * ramdev soon brings his extended family who takes over the business. his younger brother ram bharat is soon in charge of the finances. this causes rift between karamveer and ramdev. afterall ramdev shouldn’t have familial relations. so one day, karamveer just walks out. * swami yogananda (whose license enabled the setting up of divya pharmacy) has a falling out with them. **soon he is mysteriously knifed to death.** the neighbors are cagey and the case goes unsolved. * enter rajeev dixit. a swadeshi and founder of azadi bachao andolan. ramdev’s interest in entering politics leads to these two becoming incredibly close much to the discomfort of balakrishna and ram bharat * meanwhile, his political favors with the congress masters reap him reward as he wins contracts of food processing plants. but soon, due to not paying workers at divya pharmacy minimum wage they draw the ire of citu. brinda karat soon claims that the workers brought her ‘testicles of some sort of wildcat’. apparently they told her deer horns and human skulls were crushed into the medicines. though there is no proof to validate this, the samples tested by the union health ministries’ ayurvedic unit – ayush confirmed traces of human and animal dna. karat apparently met n.d tiwari but according to her the minister didn’t budge to take any action * soon ramdev starts to do roadshows across the country and abroad. patanjali ayurved ltd is born over the controversial divya pharmacy. and here we see the next mystery. the disappearance of 77 year old tb infested shankar mahadev (ramdev’s guru). mahadev was becoming quite vocal and anxious about the venture of ramdev and his deputies. police find nothing but a note in his room saying “i have taken some loan from you for this trust but i cannot pay it. please forgive me. i am leaving”. ramdev who was on a foreign trip didn’t cut it short as would have been expected. * ramdev and rajeev dixit set up a new party – **bharat swabhiman andolan.** * the takeover of aastha – when sebi freezes 93% of aastha’s owners share, sensing an opportunity ramdev moves in and buys the remaining 7% for 10 crores in installment. the installments were never paid, but the ownership was transferred to ramdev. part of this was done in faith. once the formalities are done, in a confrontational meeting, ramdev bullies the owner and md into resignation. meanwhile, he asks another follower to buy sanskar channel for him. which that follower did. * as mentioned earlier, keeping inline with ramdev’s political ambitions, rajeev dixit and ramdev became increasingly close much to dismay of balakrishna and ram bharat. soon, rajeev dixit was found dead in a locked bathroom. the hospital said it was cardiac arrest. ramdev said on television that he had told rajeev to take care of his health as he had diabetes, bp and heart disease. but rajeev’s brother pradeep says that he had no such health problems. next, ramdev convinces the family to conduct funeral in haridwar as dixit was son of the soil instead of his native wardha. but as his body was laid for public demonstration, the bharat swabhiman andolan workers were stunned. dixit’s face was unrecognizable, strange purple and blue. his skin was peeling strangely. there was black, blue blood coming from his nose. soon there was hue and cry. the andolan workers wanted to conduct post mortem. ramdev called a few of them for a personal meeting, confiscated their phones, checked their pens for cameras and told them that post mortem is against **hindu dharma.** when they refused to budge, ramdev agreed but soon went back to the hall ahead of the workers and spoke on microphone ‘some people have come from mumbai. they want me to do a post mortem. such cutting is against hindu dharma’. soon ramdev’s men got the body ready and set off to cremation ghats. * ramdev’s biggest fall came during his participation in the anna movement. he wanted to use the movement for his political mileage. hence while the original protesters were focused on a stronger lokpal bill, ramdev was more about bringing black money back. so he sat on a fast onto death protest. meanwhile there was a backdoor meeting with senior congress members (pranab mukerjee, p.k bansal, kapil sibal and subodh kant sahay). he then agreed to something and then went ahead and did the exact opposite. this ired the congress as at midnight the cops swooped on the protestors with lathi charge. ramdev of course famously tried to escape dressed in a **white salwar kameez** * part of the credit towards the success of patanjali should go to their ex-ceo – **s.k patra**. he helped them lay the foundations, setup best practices for what was a highly disoriented company with no ethics or standard operating procedures. patra also used his connections to stabilize against the witch-hunting on ramdev’s business enterprises by the congress govt. but soon patra’s influence once again made balakrishna and ram bharat uneasy. patra was let off after some ugly confrontation with baba. * today patanjali is the second largest fmcg company with revenue of **rs 10561 crores**. its best selling products are ghee – **rs 1467 crore**, dant kanti toothpaste – rs 940 crore. but patanjali ghee isn’t normal ghee but actually white butter which is not really good for health. caravan has published a transcript from the book on this section - * part of the reason for patanjali’s market share is its price. its below market as baba believes only in taking a marginal share. but this is also possible because working at patanjali is considered as **seva** and asking for increments and privileges are frowned upon. economic times has published a transcript from the book on this section – * there are a number of violations flagged by fssai (food safety and standards authority of india) including license number fraudulence on patanjali noodles. a lot of third party agencies have written about the poor conditions and lack of hygiene in the production units. ramdev is a businessman, politician and godman rolled into one. he has no doubt helped popularize yoga and ayurveda in india. the people who speak to the author are no doubt captivated, influenced and no doubt bullied by him. his close association with bjp government today means none of the open cases would move anytime soon. his target is to get patanjali to 20,000 crores by 2018-19. and under the environment of nationalistic and swadeshi assertions he very well might do it. finally, i realise that the tl;dr post itself needs a tl;dr. but its quite hard summarizing a book without loosing on intricacies. hence once again would recommend reading the book. edit 1: formatting edit 2: woah! thanks for the gold kind stranger. though i would rather have people reading the book. while indian non fiction writing and publishing are much to be desired, ventures like these must be encouraged. that will allow us to see similar good books that talk about interesting men, policies, events etc.",none,5

acda1592-acdd-4367-bd86-0d0c87dba5df,"guide to flying everyone's most hated airline: spirit! you can save $36 on the ticket price of every single round trip you take, manage expensive baggage fees, and travel thousands of miles on a regular basis for as little as $15.","we all love to travel, and we all love to travel *cheaply* even more. if you are willing to play spirit's ""games"" then you can come out way ahead. their business model is designed to chew up and spit out ignorant people, so as long as you educate yourself then you are mostly golden. spirit has launched a ton of new routes all across the country, and you can get great deals if you are a little flexible on your travel plans. [check out spirit's route map to get a feel of where you might want to fly. **how to get a good deal:** sign up for their specials email. [linkage at least twice a week they typically have a 48 hour sale. typically a monday-tuesday and a thursday-friday sale. you don't have to sign up for the email though, you can just visit [this on their website to see what deals are being offered. note: most of the cheapest fares are on tues/wed, but i've had good success getting flights on fri/sat/mon. **$36 off each roundtrip:** i was intrigued by spirit's website saying ""lower fares generally available at the airport"". i'm at my local airport quite a bit, so i started asking them to price out some tickets and compared the prices to their website. i found out that every flight you take is $17.99 cheaper per one way/$35.98 per roundtrip when purchased at the counter. you can book months in advance, but the specials are typically only in the next 21-60 days. you don't have to ask for any special discount, it just prices out this way. additional note: make sure you find out when your local spirit counter is open as you can't buy airfare at their kiosks. the desks are typically open between 120 minutes and 30 minutes before a flight. **getting around expensive baggage fees:** unfortunately, the real answer is that you can't really. but, you can take full advantage of their free personal item size of 16"" x 14"" x 12"". you can get a surprisingly large amount of stuff in a bag that size. a few companies have started making bags that size and you can search ebay for a 'personal item' sized airline bag. ciao makes a bag that sells at costco for as little as $30. lots of times the check-in agents don't monitor closely and you can get away with a bigger bag, but if they catch you it's $100. if you are looking at a weekend getaway, there is no reason to pay spirit for any baggage fees! an ""advanced"" tactic is getting a jacket with lots of pockets, which aren't subject to being sized. i have a scottevest jacket that has 26 pockets and while i haven't used it to bring extra clothing with me, i can definitely say it is worth the nearly $200. **travel thousands of miles for $15** if you took a look at the deals page you saw that even without the $9 fare club (which is really unnecessary), you can get tickets as little as $34 one way. $34, minus the $18 you can save by booking at the airport means that you pay under $16 for a flight. i have no idea if the $9 fare club airfare prices out cheaper at the airport. would love to hear if that is the case. denver to atlantic city is 1,597 miles each way and you can fly it for $30 round trip. **examples of flights available *right now* for $15 one-way (available in reverse as well):** * atlantic city to atlanta, boston, chicago, or detroit * baltimore to dallas or myrtle beach * charleston, wv to myrtle beach * chicago to dallas, kansas city, pittsburgh, minneapolis, myrtle beach, or new orleans * dallas to denver, kansas city, or new orleans * and so on, and so on. [check em all out even if it isn't $15, it could be $25 or $30 each way which is still a smoking bargain. **other spirit pro-tips:** 1) **if you can afford it, purchase the ""big front seat""**. spirit only charges about $30-$35 one way for the bigger seat. it's basically a real first class seat and it is worth every penny if you have a long flight. [found a pic online of some of the older seats. as you can see, much much 2) don't expect anything on the flight. drinks/food is expensive, but it is available. not even if you buy the big front seat. 3) the legroom sucks. it's really tight. if you are 6' or taller then you should consider purchasing extra leg room seating. **what can go wrong when flying spirit and how to protect yourself** spirit typically only flies once a day (or less, maybe 3 or 4 times/week) to each destination. if they have to cancel their flight for some reason, then you can get boned. in the event of a major problem, their customer service is basically worthless and will certainly be swamped. you can protect yourself by purchasing your ticket with a credit card that offers free travel insurance. lots of cards exists that provide help if you need to book a hotel and can even pay for it (one of my cards provides $500/year in coverage). spirit also can lose your bag. again, book with a credit card that offers lost baggage insurance and enjoy some new clothes/makeup. while i haven't experienced any yet, you could also run into some nasty delays. i wouldn't count on spirit (or any airline) to get me there if i had to be somewhere within a few hours of landing. **edit: forgot frequent flier miles!** spirit will give you 8,000 frequent flier miles for free and one-way flights start at only 10,000 miles if within 1,250 miles. [get all of the redemption options here (pdf **the miles expire in 3 months if you don't have any account activity** you can earn spirit miles without flying (by buying things on the internet via their shopping portal). there is way more flexibility using award miles versus trying to nab $15 flights, so if you love the miles game, then spirit can be rewarding. this could be it's own whole post though. happy to answer any questions below. **tldr:** spirit has big sales, so look at their deal page. buy your ticket at the airport to save $36 per roundtrip. you get a free 16""x14""x12"" personal item, so maximize your use of the free bag. buy your ticket with a credit card that offers free travel insurance.",none,5

3c98f09c-7bc2-47d3-b95c-3787c2076dfc,"i decided to consume only conservative news sources for a week, here's what i learned","i typically use unbiased or progressive sources for my news and politics, so for one week i decided to limit myself to conservative shows on fox and websites like the drudgereport. i had of course seen clips from fox shows and even caught an episode or two years ago but i hadn't sat down for multiple episodes in a row like a true fan. my thesis going into my little experiment was that i would find that the conservative sources were more accurate and less cartoonishly biased and ridiculous than how they were portrayed in my typical news sources. my experience surprised me: * **the facade of debate:** if i only watched shows like the five, the o'reilly factor and america live with megyn kelly i would think that progressives were all weak, dim, unable to argue even basic issues, and that they didn't believe in their overly convoluted (read: not common sense) rationalizations. [the is a show with five hosts, where 2 co-alpha males and 2 attractive females belittle an overweight, gray haired buffoon who throws out half arguments then defeatedly nods and exhales as the confident and dismissive conservatives set him straight. on one episode of the o'reilly factor, they had a segment on the health care birth control controversy and they brought on a small time radio radio host who would make half a point, get cut off and mocked in a dismissive manner (pattern!) by o'reilly then giggle and acquiesce. in o'reilly's other segments, geraldo rivera and bernard goldberg, the latter a conservative and the former a fox reporter and dullard, would again half-heartedly make one or two ""progressive"" arguments then be set straight by o'reilly. * **the online echo chamber, or how to self-censor the greatest tool for communication and information since the printing press:** so the cbo released a new budget projection for obama's health care plan over 9 years, the big (true) story was that the new projection was [billions less than a previous and if you searched for articles from non-partisan sources that's exactly what you learned. however when i did a search for ""cbo cost health care legislation"" over the first 24 hrs, [i got a very different for me, the very first result was a [washington examiner where the journalist proclaims that the cbo budget shows a 1.76 trillion dollar cost to obamacare, which he says is nearly double obama's original claim of around 900 billion. the problem here is that his cost is a **gross** cost- it doesn't take into account offsetting revenue and spending reductions which would bring the cost down to ~1 trillion which is what the non partisan sources are reporting. seems like a clearly, egregiously misleading statement on the reporter's part and surely one that would be quickly rebutted by other sources telling the truth. the problem is that if you went to any conservative site over the first 24 hrs, literally every single site referred to the washington examiner article alone and made the same claim, that obama lied about the costs by nearly 100%. if you remember the recent study that showed that [fox news viewers are actually less informed than people who don't watch news at you can now see exactly how this happens. finally- * **talking points as journalism:** prior to my week of conservative media i saw a [daily show about a conservative talking points memo that fox news's steve doocy erroneously read on the air. indeed, the most striking part of my experience was how consistently the same set of talking points were made across all conservative media. on every show and every website the same ""common sense"" conclusions were made by both ""opinion"" pundits like o'reilly and supposedly objective fox reporters: a) gas prices were not only controllable by the president but the current price was the result of his energy policy (not the shutting down of refineries on the east coast, not the massive consumption growth by the worlds two most populous countries china and india, and not iran's blockade of the strait of hormuz-&gt; a situation that is conveniently being exacerbated by us conservatives' saber rattling), b) obama lied about health care costs by 100% as i explained earlier, and c) bill maher's use of the word cunt in describing palin was equivalent to limbaugh calling sandra fluke a slut and obama was hypocritical to not return maher's donation. i heard these same points hammered into my head over and over again, without any sort of nuance or debate. even if your media consumption included non-partisan sources, it would be incredibly challenging to not buy into the only arguments being set forth by every conservative news source that you at least respected enough to consume. if you believe that fox's reportage is compartmentalized from its pundit echo chamber, as they claim, then you have no chance whatsoever. the day after the cbo budget was released, every supposedly unbiased fox reporter's focus was on the 900 billion to 1.76 trillion dollar gap or on gas prices and the president's early refusal of the keystone oil pipeline. in conclusion, if you're like me and you avoided conservative news sources like the plague not because they were conservative but because you suspected the reportage was terrible, you were right. and if you feel comfortable in obama's chances for reelection, mostly because of poor competition, don't underestimate just how misinformed conservatives and right leaning independents may be. **edit:** i avoided adding an edit for awhile because the ""thank you speech"" edits drive me fucking crazy, but i do want to give a few blanket answers to the literally hundreds of direct questions i've gotten: * yes i'm aware that there is no truly, purely, unbiased source but i thought that was so obvious i didn't need to say it- apparently not... i'm a naturally skeptical person so even though i consider npr, bbc, pbs, nyt, reuters and al jazeera to be as close to unbiased as there is, i'm always wary of being sold to, and i watch for the sin of omission in their reportage. * yes i watched the supposedly unbiased reporters on fox news, i even emphasized this point in my write-up, but i guess people didn't read the whole thing. it's important to reiterate because this is basically how fox tricks you, as [david frum they convince you that every non-conservative source is biased and that only they are telling the truth. but as i showed in my cbo budget example, this is demonstrably untrue. * i absolutely, honestly went into this experiment thinking that some of my preconceptions would be proven untrue, and it truly made me nervous- no one likes that initial feeling of having deeply held beliefs shaken, it's very unsettling. but the truth was worse than i expected, fox tv is almost a parody of a propaganda machine and if you don't believe it try the experiment yourself, it doesn't take much investment to change channels and unsubscribe from [/r/politics](/r/politics). * many have asked me to do a similar version with the liberal media, but i already consume liberal media along with my non-partisan sources and you do too if you come to [/r/politics](/r/politics). the fact is, from my experience, when i learn something from a liberal source such as [/r/politics](/r/politics), huffingtonpost, the daily show/colbert, politico (may be considered neutral) and then i read the unbiased and the occassional conservative source, that ""liberal"" information is rarely contradicted by reality. when i took in conservative rhetoric i would often a) immediately know something was incorrect because of for instance my education in business and economics, b) find out later it was factually incorrect such as in the cbo example, or c) recognize the logical fallacy in their arguments- if anything proved the lack of sophistication of their audience, it was that they would tolerate such terrible argumentation. if you looked at my link to the study about how[ informed particular viewers you can see that even comedic satire from the daily show gets you closer to the facts than so-called news from fox. * finally, i just wanted to say that i will now continue to consume conservative sources (i have drudge as a favorite) because i learned that it gives me direct access to republicans' game plan, and because it's always good to hear counter arguments even if they're not always intellectually honest.",none,5

e560b278-37ca-4322-991a-e16629990990,elastic collision of two bodies of different mass in graphical form,"it recently occurred to me that it would be nice &amp; conceptually helpful to express the problem of the one-dimensional collision of two bodies of different mass in graphical form. two bodies one has velocity v₁ &amp; mass m₁, the other v₂ &amp; m₂. mark (horizontal, vertical) the point (v₁, v₂) on the cartesian plane. it doesn't matter about the units: the whole plane is in '_v_ space_'. let m₀ = √(m₁₂^2 + m₁₂^2) &amp; v₀ = √(v₁₂^2 + v₁₂^2). the ellipse of (horizontal:vertical) aspect ratio √(m₂:m₁) passing through (v₁, v₂) is the conservation-of-energy line. the straight line (sloping down-from-up left-toright) of (horizontal:vertical) aspect ratio m₂:m₁ passing through (v₁, v₂) is the conservation-of-momentum line. the tangent to the ellipse at (v₁, v₂) is of (horizontal:vertical) aspect ratio m₂v₂:m₁v₁ (this is a property of of the general ellipse). this means that when v₁≠v₂, the slope of the conservation-of-momentum line intersects the conservation-of-energy line, and that therefore there is _another_ point (v₁', v₂') having of the same momentum &amp; energy, ie at _the other_ intersection. if v₁=v₂, the tangent to the ellipse coincides with the conservation-of-momentum line, and there is no _other_ point: this makes sense because obviously if v₁= v₂: there can be no collision. the total momentum of the system is m₀× the perpendicular distance of the conservation-of-momentum line from the origin. the total energy of the system is ( m₁v₁^2 + m₂v₂^2 )( m₁v₂^2 + m₂v₁^2 )/ (πv₀^4 ( m₂ + m₁)) × the area of the ellipse. this is not as complicated as it looks atfirst: there are basically three weighted means in it: if we define say m^⌸ = ( m₁v₁^2 + m₂v₂^2 )/v₀^2 , &amp; m^⌺ = ( m₁v₂^2 + m₂v₁^2 )/v₀^2 , &amp; m^⌾ = ( m₁ + m₂ )/2 , each of which is just a particularly _weighted __arithmetic mean___ of m₁ &amp; m₂, then we get that the total energy is (m^⌸ m^⌺)/(2π m^⌾) × the area of the ellipse. also, another little curiosity is that the _equipartition of of energy_ between the two bodies is marked by a line of slope of (horizontal:vertical) aspect ratio √(m₂:m₁), ie that of the ellipse; &amp; therefore a diagonal of the bounding-rectangle of the ellipse; and that the tangent to the ellipse at the point of intersection is also of the same magnitude - ie parallel to the _other_ or the said diagonals.",none,5
cde1a11f-c2e1-4d97-88ca-d0d13dd88514,"looking to figure something out, but i don't even know where to start","hello all. i've got a question, but i don't really know how to ask it mathematically, so this is going to be a little bit of a long post so i can explain it thoroughly enough. apologies for that, and thanks to anyone who takes the time to read it through. skip to below the vocab if you want to get straight to the question. to start off, i'm an electrician. math was something that i loved all through elementary school, then hated in high school. i thought i was just bad at it, and kind of gave up on it. cue me going through my apprenticeship and learning all of the math that goes into bending conduit, and suddenly i love math again (for anyone struggling to teach students trigonometry because it's hard to relate it to real life, go investigate conduit bending. it's super fun. i would've loved to have seen it in high school). i think this is because there's a physical and beautiful (like this: result of doing your math well, so the payoff is huge. i started teaching myself calculus off and on as a result, because i'm just plain interested now, but that's another story. the reason i'm posting here is because i want to find a mathematical relationship that will make my life easier and make it more possible to use this math that i love. a huge pressure on the job is efficiency and speed (for obvious reasons). the problem, is that it takes some time and effort to really tune in the numbers and get it exact. now, when you have them tuned in, it makes everything go faster and you can easily make up the loss throughout the life of the job, but i think i'm the only one on the job that's nerdy enough to even try and use the math that i'm using, so that's a hard argument to make. now, i'm gonna try and write this like i'm talking to someone who has no idea what the hell any of this is, because it's entirely possible someone reading this might have no clue what conduit is, but be an absolute whiz with the numbers. please don't read it as condescending or anything like that, i'm just covering my bases to reduce any confusion, since i already don't know how to ask my question. hell, it might even make it easier for someone to google something that they need to know but that i didn't include. so here's some vocab &gt; &gt; conduit - metal pipe which is used to protect conductors. bent with either hand benders or mechanical benders depending on the size, also called pipe. the most common variety is emt (electric metallic tubing). i'll do my best not to go back and forth but i use them interchangeably so i might slip &gt; &gt; spring back - how far a conduit will spring back. if you're bending a 90 degree angle, you need to account for springback by over-bending the conduit by an amount equivalent to the springback &gt; &gt; travel - the length of conduit that feeds into the mechanical bender &gt; &gt; stub - on a 90 degree bend, this is the length of conduit that would transition from horizontal to vertical as the bender does its work &gt; &gt; leg - the length of conduit that remains horizontal following the bend &gt; &gt; gain - the distance gained back by executing a 90 degree bend over an arc instead of a hard angle. can be calculated as g= r(2-pi/2). i did this by subtracting the arc length of the 90 degree bend from twice the radius and simplifying &gt; &gt;deduct - the distance you need to subtract from your stub measurement to attain your desired stub length. for example, if you want to bend a 90 that has an 18 inch stub, and your deduct is 6 inches, you'd make your mark at 12 inches, place that mark on the designated spot on the shoe of the bender, and bend. manufacturers of benders will provide a deduct measurement for their benders (it's sometimes not accurate, but that's an easy thing to adjust for). &gt; &gt; shoe - the physical seat of the pipe. if you watch the video below it's the thing that actually spins, pulling the conduit with it. it maintains the form and radius so that the conduit doesn't kink or deform in some other way as its bent now, the specifics. when you bend large conduit, you use a mechanical bender, much like the one demonstrated in this video this is just one model by one manufacturer, giving rise to the first problem: each bender is different. even on the same model from the same manufacturer, different shoes can have slightly different results. i believe this is a result of them having different radii, but i'm uncertain. when you bend a 90 degree bend, you'll bend a piece, and then you pretty much have to eyeball how far you have to overbend it in order to account for springback. eventually, you get it tuned in, and most people will make a mark on the bender itself. what this results in is you usually have about 20 different lines, all for different sizes of pipe, made over the years. the bender on my current jobsite is very old, and thus only starts bending the conduit at its 5 degree mark (i assume it's just wear and tear and however many repairs have been made to it has just screwed up the alignment). because of this, it would be useless to add another mark, it'd just get lost in the mess. the math that i like to use is bending using travel. see, if you properly calibrate your measurements and calculate the travel for a 90 degree bend, you can completely ignore the degree markings. just measure off of a solid reference point (usually the bender itself) onto the leg of the conduit, make a mark at whatever your travel measurement is, and once that mark lines up with your reference point, congratulations you have a perfect 90 degree bend. this is also extremely useful for other bends. need to make a 45 degree bend? just halve you travel measurement. it accounts for springback on its own and eliminates a lot of guesswork. also, bending large conduit is difficult. if you underbend or overbend it can be incredibly difficult to get it reseated in the shoe of the bender (if you underbent) or to try and take some of the bend out (if you over bent). travel is an elegant solution to a problem that usually would require a lot of time and experience with a certain bender to correct. it has a downside though. you have to dial it in on a perfect bend. a perfect 90 degree bend where you didn't have to correct it a single bit. this is because those corrections change the actual bend that you're making, and can really throw off your travel measurement. so, it's a fiddly thing to get down, but once you have it it makes your life much easier. so what i'd like to do is try and find a way that i can take a measurement or two on the shoe of the bender, plug that measurement into an equation, and have a travel measurement that's accurate enough to use. if it's even within an eighth of an inch, accuracy wise, that would still dramatically reduce the amount of trial and error necessary to get a usable measurement. in my attempts to do this myself these are the problems i've run into: 1) it seems to me that this would have to be a measurement based off of the radius of the bend, but what do i measure to? the side of the conduit closest to the center of the circle? the center of the conduit? the center edge of the shoe? 2) a purely mathematical calculation of a 90 degree bend would not account for the springback in the conduit, and thus not be accurate. how do i account for springback in this equation? only thing i can think of is to spend my coming years in the trade finding the average amount of overbending that is required to account for springback and filter that back into whatever equation i develop 3) i don't think this is likely, as the conduit we use has to meet certain standards, but it's certainly possible: does springback change dramatically between manufacturers of conduit? or even between different batches? 4) could this be determined off of the deduct value? the deduct value can vary as it will usually be based off of the front of the shoe, and there is a certain amount of conduit between the front of the shoe and wherever the bend starts, so that could add in an extra variable thank you all so much for any help you provide. hopefully i broke it down well enough. if anyone ends up going down a rabbit hole and finding any interesting sources about this sort of thing please share, i'm always up for tangentially related info.",none,5

f7ae0e9b-2325-4081-b56e-8e845357219b,for anyone interested in budgets here is one year in south and central america broken down.,"so, this is based on 2 people (myself 31 and my wife 29) travelling around south and central america for 359 days (just shy of a year!). the reason i haven't just halved everything is because sometimes it isn't just half! quite often a double room for the two of us was cheaper than 2 dorm beds, sometimes we split meals and things like hiring mopeds were obviously cheaper because we split the cost. however, i hope this serves as a useful guide for all those poeple saying ""how much do i need to save for xxx months in xxx"" a pre-amble - we are fairly experienced travellers in that we never take tourist transport (only local chicken buses), we do all border crossing ourselves, we hitch-hike occasionally, we eat street food or cook for ourselves and we stay in cheap non-party hostels (ie we don't pay premiums for the ""cool"" hostels) which we never book - we turn up and get a hostel after wandering about a bit. we also do quite a few things ourselves - like hiking trips, ruins or lake tours - we never get the ""tours and guides"". also, we don't scuba dive (only snorkel) which is a big cost for some people however, we do drink a fair bit, we don't scrimp and save on big ticket tours that we can't do ourselves or that we actually want a guide/other tourists (inka trail, san blas desert islands trip, other boat tours) and we never ever miss out on something because we can't afford to do it. if it's expensive and we want to do it then we will do it and work the cash out budget wise later on. the reason i say all this is because the tour guides, the tourist transport, the party hostels and the fancy restaurants will obviously add a fair old chunk on to this!!! so, if that's what you're similar to then here's the breakdown which might be helpful for you. all of these are average daily spend and time in each country was between a week and 5/6 weeks. i've included a few caveats for the countries which you'll see below! all costs are average per day in gbp and are for two people (half them for roughly one person!) activities is anything we did as a tour or entrance into sights. other is all stuff like things like toiletries, clothes, souvenirs, things to smoke and health stuff! **brazil** (we flew twice here which is quite expensive but brazil is frikkin huge! and also we were here for the first 2 weeks of the world cup which bumped prices a bit!) accomodation = £29.75 food/drink = £21.06 travel = £19.63 activities = £2.88 other = £1.52 **argentina** accomodation = £13.22 food/drink = £17.43 (we drank a lot - world cup was still on!) travel = £8.93 activities = £7.89 other = £13.46 **paraguay** accomodation = £12.06 food/drink = £5.85 travel = £21.08 activities = £3.26 other = £1.49 **chile** accomodation = £3.92 (we had 5 days with family here) food/drink = £13.62 travel = £20.90 activities = £11.90 other = £2.11 **bolivia** accomodation = £8.81 food/drink = £12.78 travel = £6.02 activities = £16.48 (death road is fairly expensive!) other = £2.38 **peru** accomodation = £9.37 food/drink = £13.3 travel = £9.58 activities = £25.60 (including official 7 day inka trail) other = £4.44 **ecuador and galapagos** galap was a backpacking self done trip, island hopping, hostels and cooking for ourselves accomodation = £16.70 food/drink = £20.46 travel = £53.28 (2 flights to galap in here) activities = £16.98 other = £0.84 **colombia** accomodation = £14.11 food/drink = £19.60 travel = £12.68 activities = £1.88 other = £2.01 **panama** accomodation = £9.19 food/drink = £17.76 travel = £6.67 activities = £55.56 (huge san blas sailing trip!) other = £2.04 **costa rica** accomodation = £18.29 food/drink = £16.61 travel = £10.67 activities = £1.90 other = £1.60 **nicaragua** accomodation = £9.60 food/drink = £18.92 (so much lobster in the corn islands!!!) travel = £6.13 activities = £3.30 other = £3.29 **honduras** accomodation = £9.47 food/drink = £14.83 travel = £8.84 activities = £13.83 other = £2.18 **el salvador** accomodation = £16.84 food/drink = £14.24 travel = £6.81 activities = £1.30 other = £0.84 **guatemala** accomodation = £8.04 food/drink = £17.25 travel = £5.75 activities = £12.78 other = £2.68 **belize** accomodation = £17.37 food/drink = £12.60 travel = £7.60 activities = £3.16 other = £3.65 **mexico (only yucatan region)** accomodation = £10.58 food/drink = £19.85 travel = £7.27 activities = £4.33 other = £8.22 so here are the total breakdowns per day for two people: |country|av day gbp|av day person|in usd| |:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:| |**country**|**av day gbp**|**av day person**|**person/day in usd**| |argentina| 60.92 |30.46| 47.82| |belize| 44.38 |22.19| 34.84| |bolivia| 46.46 |23.23| 36.47| |brazil| 74.84 |37.42| 58.75| |chile| 52.46 |26.23| 41.18| |colombia| 50.27 |25.13| 39.46| |costa rica| 49.07 |24.53| 38.52| |ecuador + galap| 108.26 |54.13| 84.98| |el salvador| 40.03 |20.02| 31.43| |guatemala| 46.46 |23.23| 36.47| |honduras| 49.14 |24.57| 38.58| |mexico| 50.25 |25.12| 39.44| |nicaragua| 41.24 |20.62| 32.37| |panama| 91.21 |45.61| 71.6| |paraguay| 43.74 |21.87| 34.33| |peru| 38.11 |19.05| 29.91| so there we go. for two people, for a year travelling we spend a grand total of: **£18,651 or usd 29,282** so about **usd 15k each.** also, as a bit of fun here's some stats!

9d98b3ba-6f3e-4320-98d4-6f07721abd9a,"chester bennington passed away 2 years ago today. i'd like to take this opportunity to share some lesser known non-album tracks so that those who miss him or linkin park can have ""new"" music to listen to.","through the nearly 2 decades that chester bennington was in linkin park, a lot of music got made. a lot of that music never made it onto an official album release. instead, a great majority were released on yearly discs for the lp fan club, known as the lp underground. some still were released through various other means. below, in roughly chronological order, are finished (in most cases) tracks that a non-hardcore fan may not have heard before: **slip (circa 1999)** originate from when linkin park were known as xero, pre-chester. the song was redone once chester joined the band. this demo was eventually released on lpu11 in 2011. **blue (circa 1999)** is a song that the band largely considered crap. they would end up recording it, but abandoned almost all of it later. the bridge, however, the band actually liked. they took the vocals from that section, and with new words and new chords underneath, created the chorus to hybrid theory hit crawling. blue would also see release on lpu11 in 2011. **so far away (circa 1999)** [so far is the earliest instance of rapper/guitarist/pianist/bassist/producer mike shinoda singing on lead vocals, almost a decade before he would do so on minutes to midnight. the chorus is interesting in that it has mike singing with chester almost rapping his lines in a call-and-response manner, a reversal of the formula that brought linkin park to fame. so far away was released to fans on lpu12 in 2012. **dedicated (circa 1999)** is a rap-centric track written by mike leading into the hybrid theory sessions. a few interesting facts on this one: the version of dedicated that was released is censored, with the word ""shit"" being muted. this is the only version of the song that exists for public consumption. further, dedicated would be sampled in future collaboration with legendary dj group the x-ecutioners on it's goin' down. dedicated was released in 2002 on lpu2. **step up (circa 1999)** [step is a rap song that originates from the hybrid theory ep from 1999. at this point in the band's career, hybrid theory was the name of the band rather than linkin park. this would end up changing as there was an existing band named hybrid. chester would recommend the name lincoln park to the rest of the band as he passed a park by that name on his way to the studio every day. this ep was released in very limited numbers in 1999, but was eventually rereleased in 2001 for the lpu, technically making it lpu1. step up was a popular song to be played live by the band throughout their nu-metal era. the song would also later be sampled by the band on it's goin' down and reanimation track kyur4 th ich. **and one, carousel, and part of me (circa 1999)** [and and [part of are also songs from the hybrid theory ep. unlike step up, however, the band would keep these songs in consideration for their debut album, rerecording them and adding parts through the hybrid theory recording sessions. interestingly, since these are demos for the album hybrid theory but also got an official release on the hybrid theory ep the year earlier, you get an interesting scenario where the ""demo versions"" of these three songs are actually more recent than the ""official releases."" i've linked the demo versions in this post. these were included in demo cds to get word out about the band. speaking of demo cds... **she couldn't (circa 1999)** [she was a track found on a hybrid theory demo cd. it's a clear indicator that, even as they were developing their breakout nu-metal sound, linkin park were willing to experiment with drastically different sounds. she couldn't is softer, vocally, than anything that could be heard at this point from chester, and featured a sparse guitar lead and a synth breakdown. it was included on an 8-track demo to distribute for internal use or as promo material. she couldn't holds the distinction of being one of the longer songs linkin park has ever written, clocking in over 5 minutes in length. this would not be beat by a non-remix track until 2006. as it stands, the only songs that clock in at a longer duration by the band are the little things give you away off minutes to midnight, the catalyst off a thousand suns, guilty all the same off the hunting party, and a line in the sand off the same album. this song did not see official release, presumably due to sampling b-boy document '99 by high &amp; mighty. you might know that track from tony hawk pro skater 2. she couldn't went undiscovered by linkin park fans until copies of this promo cd showed up on ebay in 2009. **regarding 1999 demo cds: the above demo cds also include early demo versions of songs like in the end, crawling, a place for my head, and points of authority that end up on the hybrid theory album. some of them are vastly different than the version we got. i'm not going to write them up here since they ended up on a studio album, but feel free to go listen to them yourself!** **qwerty (circa 2006)** was written and recorded during the sessions for minutes to midnight. it came about due to the band wanting to debut a new song for their shows in japan in 2006. the band had actually been planning to play a song with the working title grecian, but last minute decided to scrap it and write a new song instead. thus, qwerty was born. after the japan shows in august, the band would record the song and release it on lpu6 that december. **chance of rain (circa 2006)** [chance of is one of many tracks that did not make the cut for 2007 album minutes to midnight. it's on the mellow side of what linkin park were producing in this period. mike shinoda stated that the song did not make the cut due to the band feeling like there were too many mid-tempo songs being considered for the album, like leave out all the rest, in between, or valentine's day. chance of rain was released on lpu15 in 2015. **across the line (circa 2007)** [across the is another song that did not make the cut for 2007 album minutes to midnight. under the working title japan, this song can be heard being demoed out in the accompanying dvd for that album. it holds the distinction of being the last song to be cut from the album of all the songs that were recorded during this period. across the line was released to the lp underground on lpu9. **blackbirds (circa 2007)** is yet another song that did not make the cut for minutes to midnight. this song made it far enough into the recording process to have orchestral strings arranged by david campbell recorded for them. the song was ""released"" as part of linkin park mobile game 8-bit rebellion! (sic) in 2010. **no roads left (circa 2007)** [no roads is, you guessed it, a song that was cut from minutes to midnight. this is probably the most well-known of this batch, as it was a bonus track on some editions of that album. recording of this song can be seen in the making of minutes to midnight dvd, where chester and mike tell the story of how chester insisted that mike's voice was better for the song. **what we don't know (circa 2007)** [what we don't is, well, look at the year and figure it out. despite reaching the mixing stage of the album recordings (it was mixed by neal avron, who mixed the entirety of minutes to midnight), the song is considered unfinished by the band. what we don't know was released on lpux in 2010. **pretend to be (circa 2006-2008)** [pretend to began as a song from the minutes to midnight recording sessions, but would be reworked and re-recorded in 2008. the song has a rarity for lp tracks, an instrumental breakdown outro that reduces to drum and bass before building back up. pretend to be was released on lpux in 2010. **i have not begun (circa 2009)** [i have not is a mike shinoda-centric rap song that was recorded during the sessions for album a thousand suns. the track was built around recordings of mike creating a static buzz by touching a gauge cable with his finger while plugged into an amp. i have not begun was released on lpux in 2010. **not alone (circa 2006-2010)** [not originates from the minutes to midnight sessions. it was untouched for a few years until the catastrophic earthquake that hit haiti in 2010. the band, who runs the charity music for relief, worked with other artists to create the compilation album download to donate for haiti. people were encouraged to either download the compilation with proceeds going to relief efforts, or to donate to relief efforts. other artists who contributed to this album were slash, peter gabriel, alanis morissette, dinosaur jr., and more. the album was released in january 2010 and raised $270,000. **primo (circa 2010)** was a song that began during recording sessions for 2010 album a thousand suns. it would later be reworked into [i'll be a song featured on 2012 album living things. among the hardcore lp fanbase, primo is considered to be highly superior to i'll be gone. this demo would see release in 2013 on lpuxiii. **the last line (circa 2007-2014)** [the last began as a demo titled ""ammosick"" during the minutes to midnight recordings. vocally, it is a mike shinoda-centric song and definitely has elements that date it to those 2007 sessions. despite not being considered for that album (though it reached the mixing stage of that album), the song idea would persist with the band, as evidenced from their meeting of a thousand suns documentary. at one point, a song board can be seen with titles of songs being considered/worked on, including the last line. the song would be used by linkin park's dj, joe hahn's directorial debut mall. while the last line is credited as ammosick in the film, the official soundtrack release that came in 2014 finalizes the title. **devil's drop (circa 2011-2014)** [devil's was created during the recording sessions for 2012 album living things. like the last line, it features mike shinoda taking lead vocals and playing the guitar loop that forms the basis of the song. the guitar loop was recorded on an iphone so that mike would not forget it, and thus features background chatter from the rest of the band. devil's drop was also released in 2014 for the mall soundtrack. **it goes through (circa 2011-2014)** [it goes is another song from the batch of living things demos that end up on the mall soundtrack. like the other two songs we've seen from this soundtrack, the song is largely mike shinoda on vocals, though chester is (along with the other two) credit as a writer. **white noise (circa 2012-2014)** [white is the sole chester-centric song off the mall soundtrack. not much is known about the origins of this one. as it was recorded for mall, it existed in some for at least by 2012. the lyrics of the song can be seen in youtube videos documenting the launch of 2014 album the hunting party. fittingly for that album's style, white noise has a dirtier, guitar-based instrumental than the other 3 mall songs. it would be released for free download by linkin park in 2014. **what are you worth (circa 2016)** what are you worth is a demo from the one more light sessions. it is a mike-centric song, and is decidely more rock-focused than other songs from those sessions. what are you worth was leaked to the public in 2019. there is no link for this song largely because it was not meant for release and i would like respect the band and label's wishes to not share this song. **looking for an answer (circa 2017)** [looking for an is, as of today, the last song written for/under the name of linkin park. this song does not exist in album form, and was written by mike shinoda after chester passed away. it was performed at the celebrate life memorial concert for chester. i hope everyone is doing well today. thank you for sticking around through this whole post, and i hope you found some new linkin park songs to enjoy, even if they are old.",none,5

c6c79582-d628-4561-8b43-ecdba8739c30,an open letter to all indians from kerala,"dear all, yesterday something happened in our state, to be precise, the very next day after the ""cattle ban for slaughter "" and the first day of the holy month of ramadan. a temple was found desecrated on saturday near nilambur (district of malappuram) . the doors of the main sanctum and the idols inside were found broken. this was almost immediately followed by a hartal by hindu aikya vedi. the protesters tried to block the way of shri. aryadan muhammed , former congress mla and former minister of electricity who was there to visit the place. next was the commencement of a direct and a social media campaign urging hindus to be ready to open refugee camps across southern districts of kerala. there were rumors of possible muslim involvement. but fortunately nothing happened according to the plan of the instigators. this was due to a timely intervention of the kerala police department who caught the perpetrator within 24 hours. the accused is rajaram mohandas, a trivandrum resident. according to him, he did this to protest against bad customs in the hindu religion. not a believable story at all. someone traveled more than 350 kms just to protest against bad customs. he just by co-incidence chose the district with the largest muslim population. the beginning of ramadan is another co-incidence, cattle ban law is yet another one.. a series of unfortunate co-incidences. you get the idea, don't you? the timely action of our police is really commendable. equally appreciated is the maturity and composure shown by the hindu brothers and sisters of malappuram who did not jump to conclusions based on rumors and cooked up stories. unfortunately, this is not the first incident of its kind. cooked up stories have become the cause or have sparked major riots. you can find numerous examples of similar incidents all across the country. here is a small example... prior to the gujarat riots, a local newspaper reported an incident, a story about how the bodies of two hindu women were found on the banks of a river. two days later the newspaper disawowed the story in a small column in a not so noticable place. but the damage was done. it fueled cruelty towards women during the ensuing riots but incidents like this are new to us. we are not familiar with the purposeful spreading of lies to create a split among people of different religions and to benefit from it politically and financially. so it is both shocking and sad to say that the gap between these kinds of incidents is becoming shorter. what they are trying to do is obvious to us. willfully spreading false information among the people - depicting different districts of kerala as ""pakistan"" and ""china"" of kerala, the state president of bjp openly lying on twitter, spreading misinformation about the population of kerala and the real estate business in malappuram etc are different acts in this big political drama. to add to this, there is also a smear campaign going on against the state of kerala itself. if anybody feels that nothing of this sort will happen, if some innocent souls remain doubtful, let me ask them something. four years back, did anyone think that one fine morning, all 1000 &amp; 500 currency notes would become useless and the whole country would be asked to stand in a ""queue"" to show patriotism? by the way, did anyone know about the 'actual' loss and/ or gains of demonetization? you might remember the first man attacked and killed in the name of ""beef"". you might not remember those who were killed after because these incidents have lost their news value. cows were here long before we got our freedom and they have been here for almost 69 years after. and nothing of this kind has happened ever before. if this now has become normal for you my friend... did anyone imagine in their wildest dreams that the list of the names of students and writers who have disappeared would become this long? the answer is obvious... all these plans are to create insecurity in the minds of the majority. the majority should feel insecure, that they are denied justice, and that they will be overpowered and outnumbered by the minority in the immediate future. then they will enter the scene as the heroes to save the ""majority in distress"" fortunately kerala was able to avoid a communal riot. but the state saw a new kind of politics. politics of lies. politics trying to create split and violence to gain power and to be in power. we are thankful to the people of kerala and the efficient police department for keeping the peace and unity of kerala even after repeated attempts to disrupt this harmony. is there any way to avoid the obvious? answer is yes. and it is very simple too. 1. do not jump to conclusions. if someone says that ""hindus are not allowed to venture out to the attingal sea"", first ask is it true or at least ask does attingal have a sea or a beach or at least a lagoon. 2. if someone poses as your savior or of your religion, first think who will have the ultimate gain. you or him? if a leader tells you to go and kill someone for hindutva/ christianity/ islam, first think is it for him or for the betterment of ""said religion"". 3. we are educated for a reason. ask for the source of facts and figures. try to understand the truth. most importantly, build and nourish relationships. no one - neither some leader in delhi nor the lok sabha or anywhere else can replace your immediate neighbor in the time of need. at least share a smile. say a 'hi'. little things like these build bonds. only that can resist fascism. these are bad times. if we need a better india, we must be vigilant. be warned, these incidents will keep on happening.. thank you. love and regards, from kerala dr nelson joseph",none,5

f173b5ab-1c95-4a6e-b957-b22e639b5fee,the things they don't tell you about solo travel,"every so often there's a post in here from a frustrated backpacker. it's either, ""just got back from a solo trip and i didn't enjoy it"" or ""been here 4 days and haven't made any friends, yet."" i think that part of the blame falls on dudes like me saying shit like, ""man, solo travel is so much better. just buy a fuckin' book and go."" without a disclaimer. so here's my disclaimer: **contrary to what matador network purports, you're not making new friends every 20 minutes and every night in the hostel is not a slightly smellier version of mardi gras.** for every hostel where you make temporary bffs and have the time of your life there's another that sucks donkey balls. maybe it's empty. maybe the people inside are all turds or it's just plain boring. i was once at a hostel in aberdeen, scotland and it was saturday night. i really wanted to go out for drinks but there was just one other guy in the place from denmark (it was the dead of winter in, well, aberdeen, scotland)...anyhow, i said ""hey man, let's go out."" ""i can't. i have a flight on monday and i don't want to be tired."" ""but today's saturday? where are you flying to."" ""copenhagen."" i repeat. not every night in the hostel is a slightly smellier version of mardi gras. **long solo bus/train/plane trips can be boring...mind numbingly boring** this pain point of solo travel is less of an issue in our device friendly wifi on the bus world but it's still worth noting. solo travel involves some very lonely times even if you're super gregarious and a poster child for the extroverts. in conjunction with my first point, there are times you might go 2-3 days without having a proper conversation. solo travel is awesome and you will make amazing friendships but you'd also better be cool with chilling out with [me, myself and too. **sometimes you hang out with idiots** just like your mate who ""takes the grenade"" as your wingman at the bar, there are times on the road where your choice of travel mates is so slim that you wind up spending quality time with people you don't really care for. think of it as paying your dues for the times you literally make friends with people you wish could be in your life forever. not every travel connection is a match made in heaven...sometimes it's a match made in ""i guess you'll do for a trip to the museum."" **you do need to work at it** even if you're incredibly good looking and charming like me, you need to stand up and go talk to people if you want to make friends. the hostel isn't a matchmaking service so if you sit in the corner and read your book or match candies on your phone you'll likely still be sitting there alone doing the same at midnight while everyone else is out doing the boogie-woogie. take the initiative to say hello or else. making friends is a verb. **tips for getting it done** - to minimize your alone time, research hostels ahead of time. read reviews and look for social cues, not cleanliness. hint: often the dodgiest hostels are the best for making friends. - take guided tours. i don't mean g adventures. i mean day tours, 2-3 day treks, stuff where you're doing something in a group. even if it costs $20 more to take the guided snorkel trip versus renting gear on the beach, there's a good chance you'll make a friend when you're stuck for 4 hours on a rickety boat with 5 strangers. - go to the bar solo. not for everyone, but hey, if i'm feeling lonely a tourist bar and a few pints of courage is a surefire recipe for concocting a table of mates. do your best to avoid the whole american football vs. rugby conversation, it's a waste of time for all parties involved. with solo travel the highs are higher and the lows are lower, so remember that before you head out on your first solo adventure. give it time...go with the flow...enjoy your alone time because in 'real life' it's not all that often you get a full 24 hours to your thoughts. remember that when people recount their travels and it sounds like it was a non-stop love fest with the greatest people on earth that they're often highlighting 20 days out of a 3-month trip. and hey, solo travel isn't for everyone so that's ok, too. you don't have to like it. edit: very good points being made that alone time can also been seen as a positive and not a negative. i'm not trying to say being alone is bad but specifically gearing that portion of my rant towards those who perhaps weren't expecting so much alone time when all you hear are the stories when you're not alone. point also taken that not everyone who travels solo is looking to meet a ton of people nor is every solo traveler staying in hostels - but clearly these sorts of travelers aren't the type who are disappointed when they aren't making as many connections/friends as they thought they would.",none,5

services are fair, and which ones are not.","i would like to show the actually breakdown of where the money goes across a variety of different music distribution platforms, so you can decide for yourself what is fair, and what is not. i decided to publicly publish all my financial information for the past year. i am an independent musician, that creates instrumental guitar music. i am not bringing home the big bucks, but i feel i have enough information to give an accurate financial depiction. i have all the charts and screenshots published in an imgur link at the bottom of this post. if you check them out and believe that i am missing some valuable insight, please let me know and i can edit that information into this post. let us begin. i get my stats from the service distrokid. please do not think this is just an ad for distrokid, it s not. in fact, the reporting analytics are piss poor, which only allows me to give insight towards itunes and spotify. i can see the earnings from all the other services, but don’t have any stats streams/downloads etc. **itunes**. for every sale on itunes i keep 77% of the sale. so $0.77 cents per song. i feel that is pretty fair for a behemoth such as apple. not much more to it than that, pretty straight forward. **bandcamp** is a bit more complex. they say they take 15% as their cut from each sale, but after all the paypal fees, it comes out to be much less. when somebody buys my album of of bandcamp for $5.00, i get $3.90 in my paypal account. that is 78%, about the same as itunes. important to note however, the more somebody pays for an album the more this percentage goes up. if somebody pays $10 for an album, i get 8.06, so about 80%, but more or less the same. i offer my music for free on bandcamp, with the option to pay. this is just a personal preference, and i believe it fosters a better community of sharing and creation. my revenue from bandcamp (from my 2 album sales, not including individual song sales) has been $1,025. from that, 619 people downloaded them for free, and 160 decided to pay. if you break it down by revenue from total downloads, it comes out to be $1.31 per album. of those who decided to pay, the average price that was chosen was $6.40. for the time being, i will continue to offer my music for free on bandcamp. i believe if people want it they will download it anyway, and i rather be in control of the channels that they are getting it from. now for the streaming. **spotify**. all in all i have had 176,548 streams on spotify, which has yielded $706.02. this comes out to be $.004 a stream. this means for every million streams the artist gets paid $4,000. **youtube**. i believe this is the biggest competitor to spotify. from 356,064 streams on youtube, i have yielded $145.55. this is with every fucking ad option selected. that comes out to be $.0004 per stream. this comes out to be $400 per million streams. also, keep in mind that a lot of the music on youtube is not on the artist's channels, in which case they are getting nothing. unfortunately distrokid analytics are not that great, so i can not provide any insight on the following services, but i can show you how much i made from each. i would be really interested to see the stream sats for tidal and google play and apple music, to see how they relate to spotify. i will update everybody as soon as distrokid gets their shit together and i can report it. * itunes: $198.80 * itunes match: $0.29 * apple music: $36.44 * spotify: $706.02 * pandora: $0.33 * deezer: $0.86 * tidal: $5.49 * yt music: $1.00 * groove streaming: $0.09 * groove downloads: $0.70 * google play: $8.04 * google play all access: $14.03 * amazon: $28.26 i'll leave with this information and decide for yourself the best way to support artists. when i get updated statistics i will post them. again, don’t think this is an ad for distrokid. if anything this is a thinly veiled attempt to draw attention to my music by offering you something of value in return. i will also give you my opinion on the state of music. the music industry is far from dead, it just needs to adapt. i get so annoyed by musicians bitching about how they don’t get paid enough when comparing it to ten years ago. i heard someone say “i am getting paid fractions of a cent fort someone to hear my song, when they used to buy it for a dollar.” that logic just doesn't make sense. i feel like i don’t have to explain to benefit of rapid discovery that has come with the streaming industry. also, buying physical copies of music is not dead in any sense. if anything the desire to own an artist's works has grown significantly, and we can see that in the rise in vinyl sales (i learned this in a reddit post the other day). i have sent fans prints of my album art (fans that have found me on spotify), and physical copies of my works as well. vinyl is coming back in a good way. you know what they say, technology is cyclical. thanks for checking this out. i hope you learned something from this, or at least it gave you a little bit of insight to something you already know a lot about. if you are curious in the music i make, my

3971879f-3ab7-47c4-b98a-ba504113dc21,post-trip notes: wow air,"i wanted to write a little bit about wow, since i see frequent questions on here about whether the airline is safe/comfortable/really as cheap as advertised. additionally, since it's now expanding to the west coast and to more connecting cities, more people are likely to ask in the future. in september, i was having a bad day so i impulse-bought two tickets on wow to paris (cdg) via reykjavik for $330 apiece. holy shit. by comparison, the cheapest available flight to paris on my dates was $599 with turkish with one stop in istanbul. the cheapest non-stop was $715 with air france in early january. so wow offered a good deal. here's how it all went. **price**: wow air follows the low-cost model of spirit or frontier, a low base fare with additional fees for seat selection, baggage, and meals. with the purchase of extra-legroom seats and carry-on baggage, i paid an additional $198, bringing the total cost of my tickets to $429 each. this is still about $170 cheaper than the turkish flight, plus wow had a shorter, more convenient layover. additionally, on the red-eye from bos to kef, i chose the xl legroom seats at $38 apiece, an unnecessary luxury. on that note ... **seats:** in terms of seating, flying wow is basically the same as flying easyjet abroad or most of the legacy carriers in the u.s. wow operates a fleet of a320s and a321s with standard three-by-three seating in a single coach-class config. this is a plane that everyone has taken at some point and is perfectly fine. legroom was fine at around 31 inches standard. the xl seats i booked (1a and 1b) were 34 or 35 inches and were insanely, almost unnecessarily roomy. row 2 on the right side of the plane was even roomier, with near-business-class legroom. if you're pau gasol tall, consider spending the extra $38 to $48 for these seats. otherwise, standard legroom should be fine. **baggage**: wow sets strict weight and dimensions limits for carry-on baggage, and the free 5 kg you're allowed may not be sufficient for a long trip. i paid $38 each way for an additional 7 kg of carry-on allowance (that's 12 kg total, or 26 lbs). this was more than enough for 10 days in europe. no one measured my bag's dimensions, but it was weighed at check-in both in boston and in paris, and the desk seemed pretty strict on weight limits. my general pro-tips: invest in a lightweight carry-on like [it and buy yourself a luggage scale. my luggage scale even has a level in it. how useful for those household fixing things i never do! most of my fellow travelers seemed to be students or backpackers who also stuck to the carry-on limits, plus a few naive flyers with suitcases the size of a garden shed. (were they planning on smuggling sheep out of iceland?) as with all low-cost carriers, checking bags is expensive and can probably be avoided. **check-in**: wow air doesn't offer mobile check-in at this time, so you'll have to head to the airport about two or three hours ahead of time to get your boarding pass and seat assignment, if you haven't reserved a seat prior. in boston, there was no line at 3:30 for a 5:45 flight. in paris' dull and antiseptic terminal 3, the line was rather long but moved quickly. we were through in a half-hour. at check-in, you will weigh your bags and receive paper boarding passes. these are annoying and i always lose them in airport bathrooms. consider stapling to your person. **boarding**: in boston, we boarded back to front, which was a little bothersome, both being in row 1 and seeing how many flyers had carry-on bags. however, there was plenty of room in the overhead compartment for my bag, so my fear was unwarranted, like most of my fears (hostile takeovers, bears). for our connection to paris and for both flights returning to the u.s., we boarded shuttles that took us to the hinterlands of keflavik and degaulle's runways (a trademark of low-cost flying). boarding was a goddamn free-for-all once everyone got off the bus, like a horde of moms descending on a kohl's on black friday. fair warning: waiting in a bus at 4 a.m. in iceland while maintenance refuels a plane is pretty unpleasant. i was sleepy and cold and a little annoyed, but life is filled with small miseries. **in-flight experience**: as noted, the seats were reasonably comfortable, with decent width and legroom and slightly stiff padding. seats have electrical outlets but no seatback entertainment. i'm ok with this after a recent jal flight in which i watched ""tammy"" three times, in japanese, out of desperation. wow also offers ipad rentals, if you reach that same level of desperation, or you could just bring your own book or whatever. several times throughout the trip, flight attendants came by with the snack cart, offering sandwiches, chips, drinks, etc. food seemed reasonably priced; however, menu prices are in icelandic isk so check the exchange rate before you get off the ground. i didn't eat anything onboard, but it seemed that quite a few people around us did. pro-tip: skyr is not available on flights departing from the u.s. so if you want to satisfy that sweet skyr itch, you'll have to wait until your return flight. in general, the plane is fine in a no-frills, bright and bubbly kind of way. wow's brand marketing team obviously went to some trouble to make the in-flight collateral (sick bags, signage) cheeky and cute. the staff was professional and prompt and heart sinkingly attractive. speaking of. **skuli:** wow's ceo is named skuli and he's hot as fuck. [look at be jealous of skuli. **conclusion**: wow doesn't have swish safety videos or mood lighting or business class or in-flight meals. there are some small cost-cutting annoyances, like lengthy boarding procedures and departures from the least desirable parts of the airport, where a hudson news is but a distant dream. but what wow *does* have is dirt-cheap transatlantic flights. getting to paris for $300+ was unheard of before this. in fact, flying is getting pretty affordable with wow and others like them (norwegian air, xl airways) entering the u.s. that's a good thing, as long as you don't expect first-class-on-emirates treatment at frontier prices. overall, my flight was pleasant in an utterly standard way. it was comfortable and cheap and i was in boston one day and in paris by 11 a.m. the next, all for $400 and a slight butt cramp. who could argue? i would fly wow again, simply because wow has a good product and good prices. and also skuli. wow has skuli.",none,5

there’s actually a lot more going on there than i knew back in the late ‘90s when it was all over the radio. key to my newfound appreciation of it is reading the lyrics, most of which i couldn’t actually make out just from listening. here they are, in their entirety: &gt; it ain't no joke, i'd like to buy the world a toke &gt; and teach the world to sing in perfect harmony &gt; and teach the world to snuff the fires and the liars &gt; hey, i know it's just a song but it's spice for the recipe &gt; this is a love attack, i know, went out but it's back &gt; it's just like any fad, it retracts before impact &gt; and just like fashion, it's a passion for the with it and hip &gt; if you got the goods, they'll come and buy it just to stay in the clique &gt; so don't delay, act now, supplies are running out &gt; allow, if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive &gt; and if you follow, there may be a tomorrow &gt; but if the offer’s shunned, you might as well be walkin' on the sun &gt; twenty-five years ago, they spoke out and they broke out &gt; of recession and oppression and together they toked &gt; and they folked out with guitars around a bonfire &gt; just singin' and clappin', man, what the hell happened there? &gt; some were spellbound, some were hellbound &gt; some, they fell down and some got back up &gt; and fought back against the meltdown &gt; and their kids were hippie chicks or hypocrites &gt; because fashion is smashin' the true meaning of it &gt; so don't delay, act now, supplies are running out &gt; allow, if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive &gt; and if you follow, there may be a tomorrow &gt; but if the offer’s shunned, you might as well be walkin' on the sun &gt; and it ain't no joke when a mama's handkerchief is soaked &gt; with her tears because her baby's life has been revoked &gt; the bond is broke up, so choke up and focus on the close up &gt; mr. wizard can't reform, no god-like hocus-pocus &gt; so don't sit back, kick back and watch the world get bushwhacked &gt; news at ten, your neighborhood is under attack &gt; put away the crack before the crack puts you away &gt; you need to be there when your baby's old enough to relate &gt; so don't delay, act now, supplies are running out &gt; allow, if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive &gt; and if you follow, there may be a tomorrow &gt; but if the offer’s shunned, you might as well be walkin' on the sun i’m not saying it’s dylan, but those lyrics are much more clever and intricate than they appear on first listen. reading the lyrics also gives me the impression that the song is less cynical and sarcastic than i originally thought. i used to think it was just making fun of hippies, and how baby boomers abandoned their principles, and how the hippie movement was co-opted into a fashion statement. but giving it a closer look, the singer sounds genuinely sad and angry that we’ve forgotten the ideals behind the fashion. i completely missed the meaning of the lines, “and if you follow, there may be a tomorrow / but if the offer’s shunned, you might as well be walkin’ on the sun.” maybe i’m reading too much into it, but to me this sounds less dismissive and more apocalyptic. i don’t know if he’s talking about global thermonuclear war or global warming, or both, but the impression i get from these lines is: the hippie ethos of peace and love and living in harmony with the earth is not just nice to think about; it’s necessary for our survival as a species. and if we as a society don’t reconnect with that, we will *literally destroy ourselves*. and these fuckers turned it into a meaningless fashion statement and sold it back to us as new beetles and flared jeans, and now the only remnant of this incredibly vital counterculture is more widespread use of substances that *destroy people’s lives*. i mean, that’s fucking horrible! and seeing those lines that way casts new light on the part, “allow, if you’re still alive...” i used to think that was just making fun of baby boomers for being old, and/or the endless cycle of old fads becoming cool again. but in light of “and if you follow, there may be a tomorrow,” it sounds more like a warning. funnily enough, it’s now been almost 25 years since this song was released. and the ice caps are melting at a terrifyingly fast rate and we are, thanks to trump, once again perilously close to nuclear war. and we’re all kind of avoiding thinking about it by drowning ourselves in exactly the sort of distractions this song is about (drugs, consumerism, etc.). the hippies’ offer was definitively shunned, and now we’re closer than ever to our own destruction. this is a surprisingly good song, man. it’s catchy, well-crafted, and well-written, with something to say and actual relevance to our time. laugh at me all you want, but i’ve got genuine respect for smash mouth right now. also, the first person to comment “somebody once told me” is getting downvoted so hard their grandchildren will lose karma. edit: added formatting for clarity.",none,5

1142af91-63dc-4992-b108-7d68296c93aa,some thoughts on budgeting for noobs. add yours.,"so you’ve plowed through a few buzzfeed articles, drooled over your mates’ photos on facebook and are all bonered up to embark on your very first international adventure. sweet. but how much is this bad boy going to cost? if you’ve never gone it’s hard to tell. that hipster barista outside of whole foods told you that he traveled for 6 months on 3 grand but then bob barker says that 5 days/6 nights in rome runs $5,329 and that was in bloody 1987. so who’s right? both of them (potentially). the problem is that you neither want to travel like [this guy]( nor [this lady]( – you want the standard hostel-going, beer swilling, make out with some foreigners and have a good time while seeing some ‘old shit’ to get cultured experience. here’s a quick guide to help you figure out a reasonable budget that’s right for you. *disclaimer*: i am talking about budgeting a “budget” trip (i.e. paying for low-end lodging and transport) and not true shoestring travel. these tips do not account for helpx, wwoofing, busking, begging, couchsurfing, hitchhiking, free camping or similar radical cost-cutting measures. i have no experience with this stuff and don’t purport to. **be wary of anyone else’s budget** think of any “how much does it cost?” type question. from buying clothes to food to cars, computers and more, everyone’s got a different idea of what they like and/or expect for their money. one person might spend $5.99 + tax at happy teriyaki because they drink the free tea, pass on the spring roll and pocket the change instead of tossing it into the tip jar. the next guy adds a coke plus an order of gyoza before tipping his change plus a crisp george washington. person a says happy teriyaki costs 6 bucks, person b says 10…it’s almost exactly the same product. and we’re not even talking about person c who cooks shitty teriyaki at home for $1.50 and person d who drops $100 at benihana’s instead. it’s the same with travel. personal tastes are always going to guarantee that your travel style will never match up with someone else – you’re always going to be comparing apples to oranges, so take anyone else’s budget with a grain of salt and research costs on your own. other people’s budgets are great for a guideline. for a starting point. for determining a basic range to begin your analysis. if the general consensus is that destination x costs $20-$50/day this is a great starting point…but always take the time to figure out where your desires lie along that spectrum, don’t automatically presume you can do it for the lower number just because you hate your fucking job and just want to go. **outline the experience you’re after** along these same lines, you can’t start to budget until you get a picture in your head of what you expect your trip/experience to look like. do you see yourself ziplining by day and clubbing by night or do you see yourself reading a book in the park and spending most of your time just wandering around checking shit out? if you budget for the wrong experience you could wind up severely disappointed as your hostel mates are heading out to the bar and you’re stuck in the room counting pennies. i really can’t stress enough that most people traveling on a crazy tight budget are living an experience that truly isn’t suited for most people. a lot of people in /r/travel think i’m bagging on shoestring travelers when i say this but i’m really not…what i’m bagging on is people taking extremely minimalist trips and then telling others that they’re getting the exact same experience. **make a spreadsheet** if you’re serious about budgeting and don’t want to fly by the seat of your pants, make a spreadsheet. it doesn’t have to be fancy (unless you plan on later uploading it to /r/travel for what the kids these days call “that sweet, sweet karma”) so don’t waste time on formatting and all that jazz. start with the big fixed costs – which is primarily your flight but could include train passes, etc. my own personal belief when it comes to flights is to buy the ticket just as soon as the price is “in the ballpark” and then just stop looking at prices full stop…yes, there are charts and graphs and theories for buying x number of days before your flight or whatever but in my experience the price is just as likely to go up as it is to go down…once you have determined where you want to go and when, start following prices, when they hit an acceptable price just buy the damn ticket. the euphoria of making the trip real instead of imaginary is well worth the $79 you may or may not save by waiting. the potential money you ""lost"" is easily overshadowed by all those extra months of having that cold hard ticket in your hands (metaphorically, speaking). even if you’re planning on going where the wind takes you, map out a basic itinerary so that you can list the nights of your trip one by one in your budget (or week by week if you’re going for 3 months or more)…you can change your mind as you go but i find it’s best to list every day of your trip (even if it’s hypothetical) in order to best figure out transport/activities costs along the way and account for differing costs in lodging. once a location for every day of your trip is plugged into the spreadsheet, determine a cost for lodging. if you actually book your lodging then go ahead and throw in the number you paid or agreed to pay, but if you haven’t actually made a reservation it’s best to use the average cost over the range you consider reasonable. for example, if a dorm bed in berlin runs $15-$25, plug in $20 until you’ve got an actual booking – you can’t plan on there always being space in the cheapest place. go through the entire trip and plug a number in for each night…go ahead and leave a zero if you’re planning on taking a night bus/train to save on accommodation for a night. next, make a column for transportation…and for every change of location plug a number in for what it costs to get there…whatever number you find online, add 20%...transport costs never go down, only up…if you buy a ticket in advance then of course you can put the actual cost in…but people often forget to add the little extras that come with moving locales…maybe your bus leaves so early you have to take a taxi to the station, for example? then go back and figure a realistic number for food. of course you’ll be guesstimating based on information you find online…which is why you need to use the idea of being realistic. be honest with yourself about how often you’ll be happy to cook and how often you’d like to eat out and try the local food. clearly there is street food and pb&amp;j but just be reasonable. don’t put $5/day for food just because it’s “possible” to survive on that. same goes for basic spending money…again, be honest about how many souvenirs you want to buy, how happy you are with walking/buses versus taxis, how often you want to go out drinking and what percentage of your trip you’ll be cool wandering or hanging out and how much you need to be “doing stuff” to be happy. the point here is that the old $x/day multiplied by the number of days is a good way to get a starting number to compare with but that you really need to map it all out on a spreadsheet to get a closer approximation for your specific trip. i mean, of course part of budget travel involves making adjustments along the way…big night out that cost you 4 days worth of spending money? sure, you might have to force yourself to eat ramen for 3 days and catch up on email to even things out…but if your budget is so low that you never account for those “woops, that cost more than i thought it would” situations then problems arise and it stops being fun. **big ticket items** whether it’s the machu picchu trek or one uber-fancy dinner in paris, we all have big ticket items we’d like to experience where we forego the budget and just pay the price. run through your trip and add in the cost of this big stuff separately from your spending money. it’s cliché, but you do only live once so just #yolo in the stuff that’s most important to you and forget about the cost (within reason, of course.) **add 20%** whatever the total number is that you come up with add 20% as contingency money (not counting your flight). shit happens. to everyone. particularly on your first trip. so plan for it. from getting sick to getting stuck in a hotel when all the dorms are full to an expensive taxi ride you didn’t plan on needing to buying more shit than you’d planned, drinking more than you’d planned, etc. everyone spends more on their first trip – for one thing being “good” at budget travel takes experience. at the very least make sure this extra money is available if you need it. if you wind up not using it, that’s awesome, now you won’t be totally broke when you get home – but do plan on “what if i go over budget?” ahead of time. **the numbers don’t lie** if you come to a total number and it seems way off, be wary of tweaking the numbers too much. it’s ok to go back over and see where you can trim (cut an activity – lower your expectations for spending money – slide more days into cheaper places – opt to prebook into the cheapest hostels and so forth) but don’t fudge the numbers just so they look better. this doesn’t really help you. the best way to cut costs once you’ve already planned on being a budget traveler is to shorten the length of your trip. while many will disagree, i personally think that a better course of action to make a 4 month trip cheaper is not to try and work along the way but instead trim to 3 months. your mileage may vary on this one and like i said at the beginning, my idea behind this post is primarily targeted at people who don’t want to work for room/board on their vacation. do read articles on how to travel cheap and look for tips and tricks, both in general and for specific places, but don’t toss your calculations in the trash because the barista’s number of $3,000 looks more appealing. one more thing...i skimmed over travel insurance because i have never bought it. many people will say it's a necessity - others will disagree...but add this in with your flight if it's something you want to get. edit: i will totally admit that i was in the process of setting up a public google sheets template that people could use with their own data and then i got lazy, haha. but here comes /u/stovetopluddite to save the day. it's not downloadable but exactly what i am referring to: scratch that: [here is a usable",none,5

along). *** ###(1) intro (sec1) *** azerbaijan's a country of about 10m people (azerbaijanis, commonly shortened to azeris), 4m of which live around the capital (baku), in an area about the size of the us state of maine (or between serbia and austria). as far as geopolitics are concerned, it has one of the more complex situations in the world, so i want to give you a quick introduction that i will expand on in the photos. ##a brief history of azerbaijan located on the western shore of the caspian sea and into the caucuses, the area's been inhabited from at least the upper stone age: many empires have occupied the area from the persians to the romans to the ottomans to the ussr. in between there have been people who have vanished (the albanians, not related to the current country of albania and pronounced slightly differently: alban-ia vs. alba-nia) as well as many smaller communities mixed into the complex jumble known as the caucuses. the present majority population is turkic and can trace it's roots to the [turkic that swept from the east ahead of the mongols. its population historically practices shia islam though, thanks to 70 years of soviet rule, the azeris are arguably one of the most secular majority muslim countries in the world, if not *the* most. things like alcohol and pork are not only permitted but, thanks to the influence of russian culture, enjoyed by a fair number of people. indeed, azerbaijan is influenced by neighbors turkey, russia, and iran in language (azerbaijani, which is most related to turkish) and culture. it also borders georgia and armenia (more on the latter below). azerbaijan has historically been known as both the land of wind (especially near the caspian) and, more importantly, the “land of fire”/“land of eternal flame”: the area around baku (the beak-shaped [absheron is *saturated* with oil and gas to the point that the ground would light on fire since ancient times—needless to say, early man saw a lot to worship, most

with the boom in the gulf states (uae, qatar, etc) today. the first offshore oil rigs were built in the caspian in what is now known as the [oil an offshore city what was used, along with baku, in the

part of the ussr. to understand azerbaijan's importance to the soviet union, during wwii over 4/5 of the high quality fuel was coming from the oil fields around baku, making them a prime target for hitler's army before it was halted at stalingrad. the break from the soviet union was not clean. a major event in modern azeri history is [black january when soviet forces killed over 130 azeri civilians protesting for independence under the guise of preventing attacks on the armenian minority population; this incident was not well publicized in the west (best explanation is due to geographic remoteness from journalists), however world attention/condemnation appeared several months later when the soviets began the same policy of violence against lithuania (which was across the baltic from the west). during and after this period was the bloody nagorno-karabakh war (see below). ##what about the shape? azerbaijan has an odd shape with a large exclave, nakhchivan, on the other side of armenia (the relationship with armenia deserves its own section, below). the shape actually makes sense if you look at the geographic distribution of the azeri people: thanks to and [1828 between the russian and persian empires, 2/3 of azeris *live in what is now iran* where there are two provinces, named [east and [west and a major azeri city of tabriz near the large disappearing [lake when you take into account the iranian side of the azeri population, the exclave is just a finger of that larger combined area reaching to turkey. iran, which is only ~55% persian, is always worried about rising nationalism its azeri provinces that border azerbaijan. in practice, running into iranian-azeris in the us will have them describe themselves as persian/iranian rather than azeri so over 200 years of being split up there is some catching up to do. ##the elephant in the room: armenia &amp; nagorno-karabakh the passions are so hot on this subject that i am only going to touch on it “briefly”: the contested area of nagorno-karabakh is one of the least-publicized hot zones in the world. after a war from 1988-1994, the existing ceasefire has flare-ups similar to the kashmiri border. even before that much violence and bloodshed had been spilled upon the peoples in this geographic region spilling into both countries (with a major flair up in the years after the collapse of the russian empire). the borders between the two countries were always terribly drawn due to the intermixing of the two peoples and what has been called “stalin's creative mapmaking skills”. in the final years of the soviet union, the two countries began fighting over the disputed areas which intensified after the fall of the soviet union in 1991. the war was filled with atrocities, ethnic cleansing, over a million displaced people, and horrors for all involved. by 1994 when a ceasefire was signed, 20% of azerbaijan was occupied by armenia, and that is the status quo today. the occupied area holds itself out as an independent state but it is not recognized by any country—including armenia—due to its extremely controversial position (the three entities that recognize it are unrecognized breakaway republics of abkhazia (georgia), south ossetia (georgia) and transnistria (moldova)). outside of this conflict both peoples are regular folks, but the practical situation for a traveler is there are no connections between the two countries and visiting one can cause issues with visiting the other and visiting the occupied area will permanently ban you from visiting (to say nothing about ethnic members of either side who are totally unwelcome). don't bring this topic up in either country, it's an open wound and simply not worth it (their edit wars on wikipedia were the stuff of legend several years ago before all the articles were locked down). ##baku the name baku (bah-koo) appears to derive from the persian word for wind (bahd)—and there is a lot of it, the weather can change rapidly. the region (within an hour drive) has history going back to the stone age. by the 11th century, the city was a significant trading post on the caspian sea. in the 12th century, it became the capital of the shirvanshahs before they were defeated by the safavid dynasty and later the ottomans. as noted above, the oil boom in the 19th century radically changed the city, which began to expand into a paris on the caspian (yes, many cities call themselves the “paris of the ___”, but the construction at the time does warrant some comparison). soviet rule put the city into a bit of stasis and turned the areas around baku into an industrial wasteland (the soviets were the opposite of green), but for the most part the old parts of the city were spared any serious/horrific urban renewal (indeed the early soviet buildings were quite tasteful)—this reminded me of [tallinn's well-preserved old post-independence brought a series of building booms, and the most recent one (especially after 2007) has resulted in some dramatic and modern changes that bring the city a cosmopolitan flair in its central core by the shore of the caspian sea. due to the decrease in oil prices the currency (manat) had fallen, so during my visit the exchange was almost exactly 1 usd to 1 azd. okay, enough unending prose, let's dive into the photos! i've reorganized my previous posts into sections on specific areas and cultural aspects. i've also added links to websites and google maps. *** ###(2) baku's old city (sec2) *** the old city of baku retains it walls and is a classic medieval maze of streets that make it easy to get lost (which in this case is part of the fun). while the oldest buildings date from the 11th century, many buildings date from afterward but still have charm: even those built by the soviets. there was an alarming building boom in the 21st century, but all that redevelopment has been halted and instead buildings are being renovated on the inside: unesco issued a warning in 2003 and by 2009 had praised the efforts to turn around the area, and it does appear to have all been done in good faith. there are three primary unesco sites (maiden tower, shirvanshah palace, mohammad mosque) but the area is full of many other notable sites (caravanserais, hammans, mosques, etc). ##maiden tower ([google &gt;this is “the” symbol of baku: the enigmatic tower, its origin and purpose lost to history, is 100 feet tall and sits prominently at the edge of the old city. theories as to its creation. the term “maiden” comes from one of the many mythical stories attributed to it: that a fair maiden, rejecting the advances of a nobleman, threw herself from the top. what we do know is that it was built by the 12th century, has very thick walls, has a well, has gutters on floors 2-7, has a doorway to nowhere on an upper floor, has some orientation to the stars, and was at one point at the shore of the caspian as it rose an lowered over the centuries. guidebooks used to bemoan the confusing displays inside (which were a random, poorly labeled smattering of historical bits and pieces) but after a major restoration, completed in 2013 in conjunction with an austrian company, the interior is actually quite educational with a variety of interactive displays covering a theme on each of its eight floors. the view from the top is excellent. tourist shot in front of the maiden's tower (there aren't many with me, i promise): &gt; view from the top, the glass barriers were nicely done: &gt; another shot of the maiden tower from the bulvar (more on that below) that shows a classic oil boom building: the hajinski mansion (""ugly"" side shown). the mansion is private but has a small tom ford boutique on the bottom corner (there are a *lot* of high end boutiques in the bulvar and fountain square area of baku). the caspian used to come up to the maiden tower, but authorities built up the shore (which also protects it from occasional rises, the caspian is below sea level) so now it's about 300 yards away with the bulvar park in between. baku is currently 92 feet below sea level on the coast! &gt; ##shirvanshah palace ([google &gt;shirvanshah (sher-vahn-shah) means kings of shirvan, who moved to baku after their original capital was devastated by an earthquake. they built their palace in the 15th century on the tallest point of the old city, and it has been mostly preserved over the ensuing centuries and includes the main palace, royal mosque, mausoleum, garden, and ruins of the hammam. the complex underwent a substantial restoration and includes displays and decorative stones from an old [bayil fortress discovered just off the coast of baku ([google rediscovered in the 1960s when the caspian sea had lowered enough for archaeologists to explore it). a view of the caspian a window in the shirvanshah palace. the building had been damaged by russaan bombardment in the 19th century, but has been restored including these window covers which both offer protection from the sun and offer privacy. &gt; carving over a palace door. azeris don't use the arabic alphabet anymore; in the 1920s the briefly independent azerbaijan instituted the latin alphabet (similar to the progressive work of ataturk in turkey), and the soviets eventually swapped that with cyrillic. after independence they went back to turkey's established latin alphabet (lots of accent marks). &gt; very stylish of ottoman era—mustache protectors for sleep. &gt; *** [character limit reached: continued in comments

* **one party refuses to raise taxes to pay down our 17 trillion in debt and blocks every attempt to do so** (this *is* the key difference of the class war that has been/is being waged and illustrates the clearest difference between the democrats and republican parties: where one party supports business and the other prioritizes business wealth *at the expense* of middle class priorities. it's also the biggest driver of our deficit since bush/cheney cut them with no offsets. it was criminally negligent to *choose* to run our country into debt via 500 billion dollar in annual deficits and immoral to do so while we were fighting two wars. this is that shameful gop [starve the policy that *every american* should vote against the gop for waging. it is front and center in the class war against the average american and **the gop own it.** ) * one party supports unions, raising the minimum wage, and wage equality for women the other doesn't * one party supports the right for women to family plan and the other doesn't * one party wants immigration reform and the other doesn't * one party attempted to keep america from the joining the ranks of *every other 1st world nation* in having universal healthcare coverage for it's citizens, the other one enacted and defended that. generally speaking, democrats own the safety net. they have defended it and strengthened it for 100 years. that having a safety net in america makes you hated by conservatives when it is literally the source of happiness and quality of life for people all over the free world is a mystery to me. each of these gop positions hurts citizens but helps corporations. my reasoning is that putting dems in right now (how things were in 08) gets us back to sanity. it also sends the message that obstruction should be a losing not a winning strategy to the gop. their obstruction has [cost this country 1 to 3 million in our tepid recovery and it needs to be punished. am i blindly partisan? is this yet another reddit ""democratic circlejerk""? i've done a lot of reading about these things. my decisions are formed from what i have read, not blind or indocrinated or ideological or faith driven. i'm of an opinion that facts trump any and every kind of ideological position and that doing what works is what we should all be aiming for. looking around the world at what is working in free democratic societies and adopting those standards; implementing them and then using feedback loops to fix what's not working and improving what is; that *is* my ideology if it can be construed as one. **what we need from every american of every political persuasion** to get mad that the corporate media is manipulating the electorate by downplaying every piece of good news and overstating every piece of bad news to discourage your vote, to scare you into making fear motivated decisions and to make you doubtful of the future. it's a future we can win if we do what corporations and the 1% never forget to do which is to **vote in our own interests.* vote for your education, healthcare, a safety net to be strong should you need it, the safety of your food, water and environment, protection from unscrupulous businesses, quality shared infrastructure, better wages and opportunities. the corporations *never* forget to look out for themselves and they've goaded a large portion of the electorate into taking their positions on these things reduce/privatize education, oppose healthcare, shred safety net, reduce corporate oversight, infrastructure spending yes but no taxes to pay for it, lower wages by outsourcing, hiring the undocumented, opposing unions, wage equality, etc... in each case they cut cost on individual concerns and pocket the savings. we've become this pro-business/no citizen agenda society even to the detriment of the quality of life for our own families.",none,5

ead8578d-379f-4337-b20c-cff15ab8ded7,science discussion series: we are an interdisciplinary group of water science professionals and we’re here to discuss safe drinking water. ask us anything!,"[hi today's discussion is coming to us from the [**national academy of sciences, engineering and medicine and is a collaboration between r/science, and [**the water, science and technology ## we are panel of diverse water science professionals ready to answer your questions about all things related to drinking water. water is a ubiquitous phenomenon! but its visual abundance—from its constant flow out of taps and fountains to the immensity of our oceans—can mask the fact that 1 in 7 people worldwide lack access to safe drinking water (that’s over 1 billion people!). furthermore, in places like new orleans or the netherlands, water can seem like an impending threat without the proper means to safely contain it, or productively incorporate it into our daily lives. the broader water/society interface raises questions about drinking water’s vulnerability to climate change and society’s vulnerability to ageing infrastructure for adequate and safe sourcing, treatment, and distribution. poor drinking water quality can result from pollution from sources such as industrial waste, agricultural runoff, corrosion of lead from distribution pipes, or treatment facility contamination by man-made materials such as polyfluoroalkyl substances (pfas). emerging innovations in grey/green infrastructure, stewardship programs to reduce man-made contaminants, desalination technology, and international efforts to increase access to safe water on a global scale might help preserve and increase earth’s water supply and society’s value of it. all of these issues, and more, are on our collective radar and we look forward to discussing them with you. ask us anything! our discussion panel guests today are: 1. **will logan** is currently the director at the international center for integrated water resources management (iciwarm), which is part of the u.s. army corps of engineers. previously, will was the science attaché for the us mission to unesco and he served for almost a decade on the water, science, and technology board at the national academies of sciences. will holds a ph.d. in earth sciences/hydro-geology from waterloo university and was an assistant professor of hydro-geology at george washington university. 2. **ellen de guzman** is currently the senior water officer in the middle east and north africa bureau at usaid. ellen has managed projects spanning rural reconstruction, humanitarian and disaster response, alternative livelihoods, food security, agriculture, water and sanitation. prior to usaid, ellen worked for the national academies of sciences, where she provided policy research support to develop federal policies on managing subsurface water contamination, the clean water act, sustainable water and environmental management in the california bay-delta, and invasive species in ballast water. 3. **jin shin** is currently the water quality division manager at wssc (washington suburban sanitary commission), where he has worked for nearly 15 years. the wssc is one of the largest water and wastewater utilities in the nation, with a service area that spans nearly 1,000 square miles in prince george’s and montgomery counties in maryland. jin holds a ph.d. in environmental engineering from john hopkins university, where he was also a lecturer and visiting professor for 6 years. 4. **teddi ann galligan** is a community science educator. she draws from firsthand experience living in conditions where safe drinking water was a daily issue, as well as substantial laboratory experience, which includes wastewater analysis for a sustainable sanitation digestion technology, water quality analysis, and clinical laboratory work in low-resource settings. currently director of covalence science education, ms. galligan has designed and delivered hands-on programs in a wide variety of environments, ranging from classrooms in the united states to open-air community science workshops in port-au-prince, haiti. teddi ann was an educator and consultant at the marian koshland science museum of the national academy of sciences for more than a decade, helping visitors use science to address real world community resilience issues associated with climate change. ## our guests will be answering questions starting at **8:30 pm est**.",none,5

0cf26862-0766-4068-84ae-13aa55dc2134,just another girl with parents who are now alien to her,"i need to vent. i have no one to talk to about my family issues cause i never shared and i'm so lonely right now. i'm bawling despicably and i'm so close to shattering completely. i hope you guys listen to me. warning - it's long. it's super long. but, please bear with me and to those who read till the end. thank you, it means a fuck ton to me. i am 26f. i live independently in a different country. quite accomplished academically speaking. work in a great company and i earn well. i am, by all means, a very happy and satisfied person. please don't think i'm tooting my own horn. what i mentioned is very relevant to what i am gonna say next. my parents are also super educated, relatively wealthy and live in a metropolitan city in india. they raised me to be independent, strong and to challenge and question the world. at least, those were the words they used. i took in their words. found reason in them. firmly believed in the idea of challenging and critically thinking of everything. be it in academic/professional/personal life, i challenged it. my opinions were formed after years of observation and self-debate. i identify as a liberal-progressive female. i have always credited my parents for who i am today. but, today it all just shattered and broke into a million pieces. everything i believed about my parents was a lie and i'm just...broken. like most indian girls, my family has been behind me for a long time on getting married and tried to explain to me that this is what needs to be done beyond a certain age. this is how it should be. it's what society expects and going against the grain of the society is sure not advisable. it's not good for me and it's definitely not good for them because what will people think of us ?! i've fought off most of the advances from my parents, my relatives, my neighbors. told them that marriage is an important event. it should not be done cause society thinks so. hence, i stand by my opinion that i will only get married if i want to, when i want to and to whomever i want to. it's non-negotiable. since, at the end of the day, i will be living with that person for a long period of time (barring divorce). it might be crude to say, but i will outlive my parents. my wishes in this regard outweigh theirs. i've quoted their positions regarding independent thinking back at them. told them that they are the ones who taught me not to be a sheep. to do things that i believe in. it's always been a bit of a struggle but it worked out. they were like mini fights.. subliminal and perennially ebbing but never a showdown. my trips to india was mostly pleasant. i got to spend time with my family, enjoy good food, meet my relatives and deal with this occasional drama. yesterday, my mum attended a wedding of her friend's son. she called me immediately after and said how all of them were pestering her about my wedding and how she can't stall any longer and i ought to get married. i reiterated all my previous statements. i completely understand that attending that wedding resulted in a rise of those feelings of inadequacy again. like always she said i'm just being a coward and that once i get married it'll all get better. according to her, i don't know what i want in life. i'm not happy or satisfied. my house is empty. who'll take care of me when they are dead ? who'll take care of my brother when they are dead ? people will say something is wrong with me and that i have a loose character (whatever the dafaq that means) and they won't be wrong. all her friend's children (she'll start naming every single one of them) are also educated, they listen to their parents and make them proud, got married and some even have kids now. i need to get off my high horse and that i'm not the only one who's educated. i don't know why but this time around, she brought up the concept of education multiple times. as if she was implying that it's the reason behind my current status. to be honest, at this point, it was really getting to me. i've explained countless times to my parents that i'm happy. shouldn't they be happy that they have a daughter who's happy with her life ? she's having a ball, she talks to them happily when on call. she is excited to come back home and visit them. what's wrong with that ?! why is that not enough ? why is what the society thinks more important to them ? i'm the one who'll mourn if something ever happened to them. i'm the one that'll drop everything and rush to them. i'm the one that loves them. not the society. do i not matter more ? anyway, to all the questions my mum posed. my answers were the following - \&gt; you don't know what you want in life - wrong, you think i got to where i'm in life right now by just winging it ? i know what i want from my life for the moment. truth is, beyond a certain age, parents' don't know much about their children. it's just a way of life. my parents don't know a lot about the adult me and that's okay. you've raised me well. have faith in it. let me make my own decisions. \&gt; you are not happy or satisfied - umm, what ?! nope, i'm pretty fucking happy. i love my life. she does know i have a boyfriend btw. i'm quite satisfied with my life and where it is atm. \&gt; my house is empty - it's as full as it needs to be. \&gt; who'll take care of me when they are dead ? - i can take care of myself. what do you think i've been doing all these years ?. i don't need a guy to take care of me. i'm not a fucking burden. i've been out of your home since i was 17. did my entire education purely on scholarships and funding. how am i burden ? \&gt; who'll take care of my brother when they are dead ? - i will !! what else ? i've already told you that i will fund my brother's m.d. what did you think, my husband will take care of my brother ? why on earth will he do that ? i love my brother. i'll be there for him and he'll be there for me. \&gt; people will say something is wrong with me and that i have a loose character - fuck them. i know loads of ""people"" who are married and are terrible people. i may not be married but i've fought on the streets for what i believe in. i'm happy with who i am as a person. i know i matter to those who i fought for and i know they'll do the same for me. my society is different from yours and it's built on love and respect. and, not the fake kind. this entire conversation ended with her telling me it was a mistake to educate me. according to her, i'm not an indian any more. i'm a fucking european. i'm a blind follower with no thought of my own despite the fact, these opinions have been expressed to her since i was a teenager. my parents just never truly heard me. she felt that had i been not this ""highly"" educated, i would have been the perfect daughter who listed to her parents and valued indian ideals. now, i'm just a foreigner who'll bring shame upon the family. i'm selfish and don't care for anyone beyond myself. this sentence broke me. i've worked so hard to be where i got here. academic life is no joke. active research is no joke. i spent years of my life toiling and enjoying my line of work. all that reduced to ""we should not have educated you at all cause ... fucking marriage"". is that all i am ? just a burden to be written away ? i know if i did succumb to their wishes, next thing on the platter would be kids. what i want should matter !!! i'm so tired at this point of everyone telling me how i'm a social failure, how i hurt my parents with my independent thoughts, how i bring untold shame and disgrace to my family. it's my parents, my relatives, their neighbors and every fucking uncle and aunty harrassing me over it. i finally broke down and told my parents in a long letter that if they expect me to give up my life for their expectations and wishes, they are the ones who are selfish. it's not my character that is loose for doing what i want to do, but rather theirs that needs reflection for even thinking so. told them firmly that i will only do what i want to do because when i'm on my death bed. i don't want to regret anything. every decision i took and it's consequence is mine to bear. whether good or bad, i'll handle it. my mum blamed her father, her marriage, her brother and her children for the her life turned out to be. i know she has a lingering feeling of what if. i will not become her. my dad took so much offense to my letter. he told me should have been a terrorist dad like his friends. none of their kids will say the things that i said to them. all his friend's kids are so afraid of their parents. they blindly do what their parents ask them to. told him that that's a sad relationship. i've been quite honest and liberal with my parents because i respect them as individuals. his friend's kids don't. i know because i'm friends with them. they live a whole double life and constantly feed lies to their parents. even if my opinions are hard for you to understand, i've been nothing but honest and presented the whole truth. isn't that something he values ? the openness and the truth has to matter, right ? and finally, he said a daughter should do what her parents' ask her to do. if not, she's a third party. this shocked me to my bones. i reiterated what he said and asked if that's what he means. his answer was yes. i chose my independence and my autonomy. i'm now, a third party and my heart is broken and inconsolable. i don't think they'll ever understand. i'm a failure to them. thanks for reading. edit: there are so many wonderful replies and direct messages. i can't stress enough how much reading it means to me. just like you guys, i hope they'll come around. my brother is still there for me. i'm thankful for his existence. in a way, you are my home away from home. thanks r/india.",none,5

6e6f856a-0421-4ab1-af4b-39cb690d3371,tips for visiting the uk,"**mainly london!** tipping ———— * tipping the the uk is a bit of a minefield these days. nobody **really** knows when to do it, mainly because we’ve become influenced by american culture, which has clashed with british culture and left us all a bit confused. one thing to remember is that tipping is not the essential part of the living wage for people in the uk as it is in the us, because employers are required by law to pay a full wage to employees, and are not allowed to use tips to top that up. having said that, people working in the service industry still often struggle financially, and tips in some circumstances are appreciated, but not always expected. generally, do this: * in a restaurant with table service, tip nothing if the service was very bad. tip 10% if everything was fine, and tip 15% (maybe even 20% if you’re not short of a few quid) if the service was very good and personable. by very good and personable, i don’t mean slimy ingratiating to the obvious ends of getting a bigger tip; this doesn’t go down well in british culture and will be thought of as transparent and disingenuous. if the server just did a bang up job, was friendly without being overbearing, knew instinctively when to leave you alone and when to approach etc, and of course if everything with the order was good. * taxis. usual procedure here is to let the driver keep all or most of the change for short journeys. for example, if the journey was £9, give him a tenner and let him keep the change. if it was £7, give him a tenner and say ‘just give me a quid mate’, or something like that. for long journeys like from central london to the airport, give a more generous tip, unless the driver was a total fuckwit. trips like this can often be £70 or more, so i usually just give the driver a fiver at the end of the journey. * the only other situation in which you should tip is a hotel porter that carries your bags for you. give him a couple of quid for taking your bag, and if he had to struggle or make more than one trip, give him a bit more. * tipping in any other situation is weird, don’t do it. nobody will expect it of you. general behavioural advice ———————————————— * the uk is a usually reserved country. unlike spain, and italy and places like that, being overly loud in public is not appreciated. nothing bad will happen, but expect to get tutted at a lot and for everyone to silently hate you. in more working class areas someone might tell you to ‘shut the fuck up’, but as a tourist you’re unlikely to be anywhere like that. general rules are: * if you *must* talk on your mobile (cell) on public transport or in a cafe or something, do so quietly. nobody wants to hear you talk to your husband about what you’re going to have for dinner when you get home and see him in 5 minutes - just wait 5 minutes and talk to him then. don’t talk yourself up. i remember one bus journey in london where a woman was talking very loudly on her phone about her job in the media. she kept namedropping really loudly and trying to make herself sound super important. the tutting after a few minutes was out of control. the most infuriating thing was that she probably thought everyone was impressed, but in reality everybody was cringing at her lack of class and hoping she’d die soon. * try to take group conversations down a notch, ok? it’s not uncommon for large groups of spanish tourists on busses to all talk at the same time very loudly to each other (it’s remarkable how they do this, really). that might be normal in spain, but in the uk it’s fucking annoying. people on public transport in london generally like to pretend they’re on their own, and being reminded that they’re not is unwelcome. * for the love of god, don’t talk to strangers on public transport. it’s weird. we know we’re never going to see you again, so we don’t care about anything you have to say. leave people to read their papers or listen to music. * give seats to people more deserving than you. i find the best way to manage this in london as man is to just not sit down unless there are a lot of seats; it will save you having to second guess if a fat woman is pregnant. people from other countries are often better at this than modern british people, but just because the newer generation are wankers doesn’t mean we should let standards slip without a fight. props to eastern european men for having this down to an art. also turks. * don’t be too loud in a restaurant. it’s unseemly and comes across as aggressive. we don’t want your good time to infringe on ours. this goes particularly for groups of women. i don’t know what happens when a few women get together for a meal, but it’s never long before they start sounding like a family of hyenas. it’s usually pretty obviously forced too, and i genuinely have no idea why they seem so desperate to show what a great time they’re having. * don’t talk in a cinema. i **will** cut you. don’t come in to late and then decide you want to sit in the seat that causes the biggest disruption to the most people. stay off your phone in the cinema. texting is nearly as annoying as speaking, because the screen lighting up is a distraction. we managed for a long time without ever texting anyone as a species, you can go without for two hours during a movie. * theatre has it’s own special rules that might well apply abroad too, i have no idea as i’ve never wanted to see a play in a foreign language. i think they’re something like this: if you come in late, you have to stand until the interval (fuck you and your tardiness). i like this because it shows respect for the actors. don’t go to the toilet when the leads are talking/singing. pick the best time to go to the toilet (when nothing’s happening). all cinema etiquette also applies. pub etiquette ———————— * there’s no table service, you have to go to the bar. when at the bar to get served, follow this rule at all costs: if the barkeep tries to serve you but you know somebody at the bar has been waiting longer than you *always* nod/gesture towards that person and say ‘he/she is next mate/love’. this is vital, never forget this rule. it will usually guarantee you get served directly after the now grateful person you nodded at as well. * if you’re about to order a whole load of complicated weird ladies drinks like cocktails, it would be appreciated if you let the bloke who obviously just wants another pint go before you. his order will keep you waiting an extra minute or two, yours will keep him waiting an extra quarter of an hour or something. * bringing a well behaved dog to a pub will ingratiate you in ways you cannot imagine. some city pubs won’t allow dogs, but you should avoid those places anyway. * be careful going to pubs in non-touristy areas. some pubs are very ‘local’, and you will be paid a lot of attention if your face isn’t known. this isn’t always a bad thing, but in certain areas it could land you in trouble. some people see these pubs as an extension of their house, and might not appreciate ‘new’ faces. be careful in pubs in residential areas, and especially council estates (government housing). one oft used phrase is ‘if you see a pub with a flat tin roof, you’re in the wrong area’. britain is generally very safe, but friday and saturday nights get rowdy, and a bunch of young, territorial males might see you as a target/proving opportunity after too many pints. * pool rules are per pub. this is weird, and i think uniquely british (correct me if i’m wrong). each pub has different pool rules. they usually differ in minor details like, how many foul shots you get on the black, and whether you can shoot a foul shot down the table or just up. it’s expected you follow these rules, even if you’re just playing your mate and no locals are taking part. a strangely good way to get on the good side of the barkeep/landlord and pub locals is ask a question like ‘how many shots on the black in here mate?’ if you find yourself having a foul shot on the black. you’ll almost always get an answer, and people will appreciate your observance of that particular culture. this applies less to city centre pubs, and more to rural and local community pubs. pubs in the centre of london don’t really have ‘locals’ and get mostly tourist custom, so it would be a bit weird to ask in one of them. general etiquette. —————————— * you can call anyone ‘mate’, unless it’s a formal situation. usually only to members of the same sex, but you can go nuts with it really. * if you’re walking down a quiet street and see someone else, it’s not strange to smile, nod or even wish them a good morning/afternoon. don’t do this a city centre, obviously, but in a residential area it’s fine. being even more friendly with elderly people is fine too. don’t talk to children unless you have to, people will worry about your intentions. this is a bit sad, but unfortunately it’s a symptom of modern britain, and a side effect of recent events. if you find yourself sat somewhere in public next to someone with a dog, ask them if you can stroke/pet it. don’t do it without talking to them first, unless it’s jumping up at you and obviously wants his little head scratching. if you find yourself sat next to a woman with a crying baby (not infant), it’s fine to quietly make funny faces at the baby to try and calm it. don’t go further than that unless invited. don’t get mad at that person. babies are hard work, they’re likely stressed and it’s nobody's fault, it’s just a baby. a woman once told me that there’s nothing more attractive in a man than a tolerance and understanding of babies. i don’t know if that’s true, but just don’t be a dick. however….. * don’t take too young babies or badly behaved children to restaurants. restaurants are quite expensive in the uk, and to many people they’re a rare treat. you don’t have the right to ruin their evening because you want to take a screaming child somewhere it doesn’t even appreciate. the same goes for pubs. when i was a child, it was a very rare treat to be taken to a pub by my dad, and my best behaviour was demanded. pubs are somewhere adults go to relax and take a break from normal life, it’s not fair to ruin them by having badly behaved children running around screaming. some pubs cater for entire families, stick to them if you must take your children to a pub. * never push in a queue (queue jump). we really hate that shit. really hate it. * be fast and efficient at cash points (atms) and checkouts. the cashpoint is not your accountant. don’t make a habit of using all your cards, and printing out statements and all that stuff. check your balance and make a withdrawal. don’t fuck around after you’ve paid for items. if you need to sort out your bags and purse and stuff, move to the side to do it and let the next person get served. * don’t talk about religion or politics to people you don’t know. not really for risk of offending them, we just don’t really care about your god or political opinions. the uk is highly secular, so apologies, but be prepared to be patronised if you preach about an invisible entity that controls the world. we’ll usually just try and change the subject, but sometimes we can’t help but have some fun with it. * for the love of god, don’t call scottish, welsh or irish people 'english'. travel etiquette —————————— * this is isn’t america. it’s fine to call people ‘love’. if anyone pretends to get offended by this for attention, they’re exposing themselves as ignorant, because it works both ways. men can call women love, women can call men and children love. in other parts of the uk, ‘duck’ can be interchanged with ‘love’. a man calling another man love is insulting, and usually done specifically to start trouble and emasculate him. ‘sweetheart' isn’t really acceptable, unless you really know the person of the opposite sex. even then it’s either more tongue in cheek, or a statement of genuine affection. * walk around with respect to other people. if you’re in a group, remember that the pavements (sidewalks) are narrow in the uk, so remember to leave space for people to walk around you. if you’re in a chokepoint, walk briskly; it’s considered rude to meander along slowly talking on your phone and make everyone behind you wait. these are two of the things that annoy londoners the most. it’s great that you’re enjoying you holiday here, but not everyone’s a tourist, and some of us just want to get to work or get home after work. * knowledge about local travel routes will win you big points. whole conversations with groups of strangers erupt in pubs sometimes when someone innocently asks what the best way to get from a to b is. telling someone how they can get across london in good time without referring to travel apps will mark you out as a true londoner. not really for tourists, but if you decide to stay for a while, you’ll find yourself beaming with pride the first time you reel off a set of instructions about tube lines and busses to a bemused tourist looking to get from one side of london to the other. * you’re an adult, you can cross the road if there are no cars coming, you don’t *need* a flashing light to tell you; jaywalking isn’t a thing here. * you get to try your oyster card at barriers twice. if it doesn’t work the second time, move out the way so other people can get through, and then try at a different gate. if it still doesn’t work, chat to the attendent. * don’t just *stop* at the bottom of an escalator. seriously, are you fucking retarded? * stand on the right of escalators so people in a hurry can walk on the left. the closest i’ve ever come to homicide was when i was in a huge hurry to catch a train and said very politely ‘excuse me’ to a group of tourists not observing this rule, and they all turned on me and verbally attacked me for being rude. * if you’re a man, don’t argue with women in public. they can legitimately do and say anything they like to you at any level of volume, and there’s nothing you can do in response accept look small and regretful. i remember a woman commuter being asked to move forward a bit on a crowded train by a man once, and she belittled and shouted at him for the entire journey for ‘daring to speak to her like that’. bite your tongue, it’s just not worth it. men are generally more respectful to each other because there’s always the underlying threat of violence, so feel free to ask men to move up the train if there’s no room or something. * if your child is not an infant, make him/her stand up on busy public transport. children have boundless energy and don’t need the seat as much as someone who’s been at work all day. it’s also just a nice, respectful gesture from both the parent and child, and will restore a little faith in humanity to those that witness or benefit from it. * if there platform is quite empty, don’t stand next to another person waiting for the train. it’s weird and we’ll be suspicious as to why you’re standing so close to us when you have an entire empty platform. * if your taxi driver is obviously not a native, don’t ask him about ‘his country’ unless he brings it up. in the modern climate it might be seen as xenophobic or even as a prelude to challenging ‘his right to be here'. if he does, then go nuts as people like talking about themselves and you’ll learn some interesting things. on this: * british people are generally very welcoming of people from different backgrounds and countries. don’t be racist here, it won’t be tolerated. the same usually goes with homosexuality. in less cosmopolitan communities it might be a little less accepted, but generally we don’t give a fuck how gay you are, and homophobic comments will often be challenged. homophobic or racial abuse in public will almost always not end well for you. we don’t care what the attitude to immigrants and homosexuals are in your country, in the uk we expect you to show tolerance. * you can offer to help women with heavy luggage up or down stairs. don’t offer to help a guy unless he obviously can’t manage; it’s insulting to his masculinity. * you can hold open doors for people if they’re behind you. holding open doors for women in other situations is quite common, but maybe one out of every twenty times you’ll offend said woman and she’ll berate you for being sexist or something. it’s your call whether to risk it or not. having said that, should you find yourself on a sinking boat whilst in the uk (somehow), as a man you’ll still be expected to drown with dignity while the women get airlifted or ferried off, and not one of them will complain about sexism then. misc ——— * public drunkenness is ok really. as long as you’re not abusive, nobody cares, and people often find it quite amusing. * british food isn’t great, we know this and are fine with it. * real british beer is great and massively underrated. try lots of different cask ales. craft beer is really just british and irish beer recipes rebranded by american hipsters. * you don’t need an umbrella for a drizzle. really, you don’t. unless you’re in your finery, of course. * don’t litter. * british weather is fascinating, talk about it. it’s never very dramatic, but it’s totally unpredictable and changes all the time. it’s always a good conversation piece. * public acts of affection aren’t looked down upon as much as in places like poland, but we’d appreciate it if you didn’t start foreplay on the bus. especially if your girlfriend is really attractive because i’ll get envious. &gt; &gt; **edit: some people might have taken this a bit more seriously than i intended. it was meant** **as an exaggerated rant, and maybe even a poor attempt at satire, on some level. i think most of the points** **have at least a grain of truth to them, however, and the section on tipping is something i stand by for** **visitors to london. the point about tipping that i wanted to get across is that we *are* confused** **about

7817c2d3-03b4-48ea-b32a-64bfdd202fd8,sued orbitz &amp; won - recommend not using them,"hey everyone, i just wanted to share a horrible experience i've had with orbitz and have been trying to resolve for 3 years. i ended up suing them and easily winning. orbitz is now dragging out payment so i wanted to share my story about what a horrible, lying, and cheating company they are. proof: proof: santa clara county small claims public record case# 114sc057414 proof: so i made reservations for my gf and i to go to vietnam via orbitz. i ended up winning a performance award from my company and was to celebrate at an award ceremony in vegas with the top of the company. i called orbitz to change my flight info and they did (after charging fees and increasing their rates). they sent me a verification email and i thought that was that. before my trip our corporate travel agent notified me to say orbitz made a mistake with the flight. even though their confirmation said one thing, the airlines flight information was completely different. i emailed and called orbitz but they assured me they were correct. i then left the country for the trip and was again notified by our corporate travel agent that they were 100% sure oribtz was wrong and that i should verify with them. again orbitz said, in writing, my flight info was correct. then, the airlines informed me the dating was incorrect and orbitz was wrong. again i asked orbitz and someone responded that i was correct regarding my travel issues, but not that they were wrong. on the way home, in able to make it to the award ceremony (a day late instead of 2 days late) i had to buy another airline ticket. i requested oribtz pay for the new tickets. they refused the $466 and instead basically told me to f-off. after weeks of dealing with supervisors i was offered $100 credit and a refund of $120 ($60 for each ticket). frustrated with the situation i sued in small claims. (since they are in illinois i filed against their ca presence: csc lawyers inc, 2710 gateway oaks dr, suite 150n, sacramento, ca 95833). orbitz corporate address is orbitz llc, 500 w madison suite 1000, chicago, il 60661) they tried to have the case dismissed but was notified they had to show up. they wrote another letter requesting the same thing on our court date. they did not show up. the judge awarded me the entire amount i asked and a little more. i notified them that day of the courts decision and received verification they knew of the decision later that day. again, they didn't answer my calls, emails, etc. the courts gave them 30 days to file an appeal after being notified. days later they received the courts letter and eventually filed to vacate the judgement but filed it after 30 days of being notified. they basically said they are from out of state so they thought a written response was sufficient (even though the office clerk already notified them once that it was not ok to file in writing and that they needed to show up). so basically, imo, orbitz is tied with comcast in terms of how bad they are. even if they screw up, and verify the mistake, and then admit to it, they still will do nothing except lie. again, i would never use oribtz knowing this information and i recommend not using their service. if you have friends thinking about their service, i'd ask that you have them research customer service with orbitz first. thank you! edit: update: hey everyone, i just got back from another court apt and the judge decided to vacate the judgment. she said orbitz was negligent but she would rather have both sides reappear and state their cases before it goes any further so as of right now, the case is once again undecided. :/ i'll update as soon as we have court again.",none,5

a4eb370b-97b5-4162-bd43-10962674441e,101 years of jallianwala bagh massacre | background | aftermath | shaheed uddham singh [mega thread],"***\*picture thread attached at the bottom, please read before you check it, i've tried to keep it as short yet detailed as possible\**** the **jallianwala bagh massacre**, also known as the **amritsar massacre**, took place on 13 april 1919, when acting brigadier-general reginald dyer ordered troops of the british indian army to fire their rifles into a crowd of unarmed indian civilians in jallianwala bagh, amritsar, punjab, killing at least 400 people including men and women. over 1,000 people were injured. some facts about the jallianwala bagh massacre: 1. the precursor to the massacre was the rowlatt act. this act was passed in february 1919. 2. the rowlatt act gave the british government the authority to arrest anyone on grounds of mere suspicion. 3. the rowlatt act was basically designed for controlling activities of indian revolutionaries. 4. protesting against the act, the indians observed a hartal on march 30th and april 6th of 1919. 5. on april 10, 1919, two famous leaders, dr. kitchlew and dr. satyapal were arrested on the basis of the rowlatt act. 6. two days later on the 12th of april, 1919, general dyer took command of troops. he issued a proclamation banning all public gatherings 7. though the proclamation was issued, no efforts were made to ensure that the general public came to know about it. 8. the gathering had no political intent at all. it was meant for celebrating baisakhi – the sikh festival. 9. anywhere between 6,000 and 10,000 people gathered at jallianwala bagh on the evening of that day. 10. the gathering included even children and women since it was all about celebrating baisakhi. 11. though the festival was a sikh festival, many hindus and muslims also came to celebrate the same. all of them were there for commemorating the day when khalsa panth was founded by guru gobind singh. 12. apart from the main entrance, there was no way for the crowd to escape the garden as the area was surrounded by buildings. this is a major reason for the high number of casualties. 13. apart from gurkha and baluchi soldiers using scinde rifles, there were also two armored cars with machine guns that were used in the shooting. 14. according to records, the people gathered were not warned or asked to disperse before colonel dyer ordered the firing. 15. the firings stopped only when the soldiers ran out of ammunition. 16. the shooting was followed by the proclamation of [martial in the punjab that included public floggings and other humiliations 17. indian outrage grew as news of the shooting and subsequent british actions spread throughout the subcontinent. the bengali poet and nobel laureate rabindranath tagore renounced the knighthood that he had received in 1915. 18. gandhi was initially hesitant to act, but he soon began organizing his first large-scale and sustained nonviolent protest campaign, the [noncooperation (1920–22), which thrust him to prominence in the indian nationalist struggle. 19. dyer was initially lauded for his actions in britain and became a hero among many who were directly benefiting from the [british such as members of the [house of he was, however, widely criticised in the [house of whose july 1920 committee of investigation censured him. 20. the government of india ordered an investigation of the incident (the hunter commission), which in 1920 dyer for his actions and ordered him to resign from the military. 21. the last known survivor of the jallianwala bagh massacre, shingara singh, died in amritsar on june 29, 2009, at the age of 113. 22. the british government tried to suppress information of the massacre, but news spread in india and widespread outrage ensued; details of the massacre did not become known in britain until december 1919. 23. this event caused many moderate indians to abandon their loyalty to the british and become nationalists distrustful of the british 24. colonel dyer reported to his superiors that he had been ""confronted by a revolutionary army"", to which major general william beynon replied: ""your action correct and lieutenant governor approves 25. both [secretary of state for [winston and former prime minister [h. h. however, openly condemned the attack, churchill referring to it as ""unutterably monstrous"", while asquith called it ""one of the worst, most dreadful, outrages in the whole of our history"". 26. winston churchill, in the house of commons debate of 8 july 1920, said, ""the crowd was unarmed, except with bludgeons. it was not attacking anybody or anything… when the fire had been opened upon it to disperse it, it tried to run away. pinned up in a narrow place considerably smaller than trafalgar square, with hardly any exits, and packed together so that one bullet would drive through three or four bodies, the people ran madly this way and the other. when the fire was directed upon the centre, they ran to the sides. the fire was then directed to the sides. many threw themselves down on the ground, the fire was then directed down on the ground. this was continued to 8 to 10 minutes, and it stopped only when the ammunition had reached the point of exhaustion."" 27. after churchill's speech in the house of commons debate, mps voted 247 to 37 against dyer and in support of the government. 28. the general dyer-led massacre at amritsar’s jalianwalla bagh, in 1919, left an indelible dent on the psyche of millions of indians. 29. colonel michael o'dwyer was shot dead on 13 march, 1940, by a man named udham singh, a member of the revolutionist ghadar party who was on a mission of revenge for the jallianwala bagh massacre. 30. the casualty number estimated by the indian national congress was more than 1,500 injured, with approximately 1,000 dead. 31. indian nationalist [swami wrote to gandhi of 1500 deaths in the incident. # shaheed uddham singh 1. **shaheed udham singh** (26 december 1899 – 31 july 1940), was a revolutionary belonging to the ghadar party best known for his assassination in london of michael o'dwyer, the former lieutenant governor of punjab in india, on 13 march 1940 2. while in custody, he used the name **ram mohammad singh azad**, which represents the three major religions of punjab and his anti-colonial sentiment 3. shaheed uddham singh waited 21 years for revenge by killing the man he held responsible for the atrocity: the then lieutenant governor of punjab province, general michael o'dyer. 4. while awaiting his trial, singh went on a 42-day hunger strike and was force-fed. on 4 june 1940 5. when asked about his motivation, singh explained: &gt;i did it because i had a grudge against him. he deserved it. he was the real culprit. he wanted to crush the spirit of my people, so i have crushed him. for full 21 years, i have been trying to seek vengeance. i am happy that i have done the job. i am not scared of death. i am dying for my country. i have seen my people starving in india under the british rule. i have protested against this, it was my duty. what greater honour could be bestowed on me than death for the sake of my motherland? singh was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. on 31 july 1940, singh was hanged at [pentonville # following his conviction, he made a speech which the judge directed should not be released to the press.\[9\] however, political activists who had set up the shaheed udham singh trust and working with the indian workers association (gb), ran a campaign to have the court record of his statement published along with other material he started the speech with a denunciation of british imperialism: &gt;""i say down with british imperialism. you say india do not have peace. we have only slavery generations of so-called civilization has brought us everything filthy and degenerating. known to the human race. all you have to do is read your own history. if you have any human decency about you, you should die with shame. the brutality and bloodthirsty way in which the so-called intellectuals who call themselves rulers of civilization in the world are bastard blood . . ."" &gt; &gt;at this point, he was interrupted by the judge, but after some discussion, he continued: &gt; &gt;""i do not care about the sentence of death. it means nothing at all. i do not care about dying or anything. i do not worry about it at all. i am dying for a purpose.’ thumping the rail of the dock, he exclaimed, ‘we are suffering from the british empire.’ udham singh continued more quietly. ‘i am not afraid to die. i am proud to die, to have to free my native land and i hope that when i am gone, i hope that in my place will come thousands of my countrymen to drive you dirty dogs out; to free my country. &gt; &gt;""i am standing before an english jury. i am in an english court. you people go to india and when you come back you are given a prize and put in the house of commons. we come to england and we are sentenced to death.’ &gt; &gt;""i never meant anything, but i will take it. i do not care anything about it, but when you dirty dogs come to india there comes a time when you will be cleaned out of india. all your british imperialism will be smashed.’ ""machine guns on the streets of india mow down thousands of poor women and children wherever your so-called flag of democracy and christianity flies.’ &gt; &gt;""your conduct, your conduct – i am talking about the british government. i have nothing against the english people at all. i have more english friends living in england than i have in india. i have great sympathy with the workers of england. i am against the imperialist government.’ &gt; &gt;""you people are suffering – workers. everyone are suffering through these dirty dogs; these mad beasts. india is only slavery. killing, mutilating and destroying – british imperialism. people do not read about it in the papers. we know what is going on in india."" &gt; &gt;at this point, the judge refused to hear any more, but singh continued: &gt; &gt;""you ask me what i have to say. i am saying it. because you people are dirty. you do not want to hear from us what you are doing in india. &gt; &gt;he then thrust his glasses back into his pocket, and exclaimed three words in hindustani and then shouted: &gt; &gt;'down with british imperialism! down with british dirty dogs!"" &gt; &gt;he turned to leave the dock, spitting across the solicitor’s table. &amp;#x200b; his remains are preserved at the jallianwala bagh in amritsar, punjab. on every 31 july, marches are held in sunam by various organizations and every statue of singh in the city is paid tribute with flower garlands. # picture thread: sources &amp;

e945fe19-5b5f-46bd-84fe-7be6ee0ebc75,"no, billie eilish isn’t an ‘industry plant.’ and you’re just parroting other people when you say so. let me explain...","it’s one thing to not like her music, which is fine, to each their own. it’s another thing to construct a series of conspiracies so you don’t have to believe a teenage girl can make music. the amount of vitriol being thrown at a teenage girl by grown ass men is frankly insane, especially considering the amount of false information being spread about a completely harmless pop artist. let’s break down some of the crazier things tons of people on reddit are saying... ‘her parents are heavily connected in the industry and she’s only famous because they’re famous.’ oh really, who are her parents? are they house hold names? wait, no, they’re f-list actors with a few bit parts to their name and one low budget movie they made together. they’re not record producers, they’re not famous musicians, they’re not elite media types. they’re unknown artists who probably have less clout in the industry than a small town radio dj. ‘her music and image are formed by her label, she’s made by a committee.’ she co-writes and makes all her music with her brother in his small room in their parents modest, middle class house. need proof? [here you they’re weren’t uber wealthy before her career took off, and they’re not controlled by their label. if anything, they’re more intimate and more authentic than 99% of musicians out there. how many musicians do you know that don’t record in a studio, but in a small bedroom? that’s more diy than the majority of indie bands. she also has strong creative control over her videos, and even directed one of them. and if the studio is dictating her fashion and style, why does she wear gigantic clothes and chunky sneakers (the same clothes she wore before she was famous)? she very specially avoids sexualizing herself like all female pop artists do (which is also fine). if your only real argument for her being an industry plant is that her label has promoted the shit out of her through interviews and music videos, duh genius, that’s what record labels do. that’s their job. having the full support of her label doesn’t make her a ‘plant.’ they’ve done this with every major artist in history. by this logic the beatles, the clash, and queen are ‘industry plants.’ the irony of people singling in on an artist who co-creates all of her music with her own brother (with no other writers and producers), does it by themselves in a small bedroom, and calling her ‘inauthentic’ is astounding. for years redditors complained about pop stars with 50 songwriters contributing to each song, and finally a pop star comes along who writes all her music with her brother, and they throw a fit. what it comes down to is grown men believing a teenage girl is incapable of making authentic music and must be the product of famous parents and a record industry creating her out of thin air. it’s sad, and frankly sexist at this point. when arctic monkeys blew up as teenagers and were heavily promoted by their label, no one claimed their were ‘inauthentic’ and an ‘industry plant.’ dislike her music all you want, just don’t parrot lies and half truths because you can’t believe a teenage girl can create hit music.",none,5

aeb2d199-c4d0-4586-ab62-1f02e7c1ae31,my unexpected date with a north korean waitress,"full disclosure, this just happened a few minutes ago and i'm still in a bit of shock. i've been obsessing over north korea for years now. i'm talking the ""read every damn book available on amazon"" type of obsessed. so when i heard there was a [north korea owned chain within a mile of my hostel in siem reap i kind of freaked out. it seemed too good to be true, like there's no way they'd actually have real citizens of the dprk working in some dingy restaurant in the middle of cambodia right? but after a few reviews on tripadvisor i realized this was it, my one chance to witness a small taste of the notoriously reclusive country. tamara and i rented some $1 bikes and were off, my hands shaking from nerves as we rode. this all may sound over dramatic but if you know anything about n korea you too may have felt a pang of wonder. what goes on in this country where no information leaves or comes, where the leader is literally viewed as god and where technological advancement pretty much stuck in the 60's. there really is nothing else like it in the world. as we approached we would have nearly missed it if we weren't actively looking for it. the building itself reminds of a jail cell or military base. large concrete walls with completely black tinted windows. for some reason at this point i got a bit nervous. it would be wrong to say i was scared but rather just very put off. there were no cars at all in the parking lot, no people coming in or out just a brick of a building with the words ""pyongyang restaurant"" etched in a dull gold font. we hesitated a bit before going in, sitting on the curb waiting (begging) for a tour bus to come and take away some of the attention from us. after half an hour with absolutely no one coming i just had to go in, embracing the fact that we were likely the only people in the entire restaurant. it couldn't be that awkward, right? right as we walk through the doors we're overwhelmed with the sheer size of this place; able to seat approx 400 people with large ornate tables and multiple tacky chandeliers akin to what your grandma might have had in the 80’s. it felt like what a restaurant would look like if it were designed by someone that had only ever read about restaurants without ever seeing one. there was a large stage for performances but today they simply had a tv playing what looked like a news channel straight from nk, propaganda and all. without much time to think we're suddenly swarmed by eight tall pale slender girls smiling with hands outstretched towards a table surrounded by four small wooden walls. as we're seated in what can be called a 'cubical' we have large menu's shoved in front of us. i'm personally used to having a bit of time to browse through the menu but it became apparent that these 8 waitresses were not going to leave. the cubical nature of our table has us all crammed together all the girls hovering over our shoulders breaching every square inch of my personal space. so, i'm sitting there rushing, trying to make a decision with 8 pairs of eyes diligently watching my every move. experiencing some new levels of awkward, i just randomly choose something trying to end it all but tamara takes her god damn time. i can feel them all growing impatient, the girl immediately behind me tapping her fingers on my chair. one girl tries to help and aggressively points to a $30 pot of meat which tamara brushes off and finally makes her choice lifting the strange tension off my shoulders. **but just when i thought we were in the clear...things got weirder.** having chosen our respective meals i assumed that this pile of north korean women would file out of our cubical-table area leaving us to silently laugh at the ridiculousness happening to us. but no, not at pyongyang restaurant. all eight of them just... stood there crowded around us watching our every move. i didn't know what to do, having never been in a situation like this. i could feel their eyes burning into the back of my head and as each second passed i felt progressively more and more unsettled. i started babbling random sentences to tamara making up conversation trying to ease the tension and break silence. as we were bullshitting to one another talking about (stocks?) one of the nk women at the head of our table started making mumbling sounds like she wanted to talk. i stopped talking and waited for her to speak, assuming this was the point they tried up selling alcohol to us. but instead of a sales pitch we got a question, a genuine question. in very broken and timid english she mutters ""ar..are you a couple?"" i look up to her and see she's half smiling and eagerly awaiting my response. ""yes! yes we are."" i laugh a little, realizing now that the tension i've been feeling may not have been as heavy as i had thought. they were all smiling, all the women in this 10x10 sq. foot box were looking to us with interest not judgement. in that second, all my compounding anxiety turns into excitement. i realize that i have a captivated group of north korean women wanting to just… talk with me. this is a moment i’ve literally been dreaming of for years, it honestly felt akin to meeting a celebrity and i was star struck for the first time in my life. like having jk rowling across a dinner table, it felt once in a lifetime so i dived in head first. “are you married?” she asks next, her eyes opening a bit wider smile growing a bit larger we both laugh and say no. we tell her that it’s not usual for our cultures to marry this young. i then ask her if she’s married and the entire group laughs loudly. “no no no” she laughs as she buries her head into her shirt. we all smile, tension completely gone at this point the questions just come flowing out. “how long are you in cambodia?” “about a week. how long have you worked here?” “two years” she says very matter of factly, a tinge of sad palpable in her voice. our appetizer arrives. we’re then put through the wildly unique experience of attempting to eat slippery dumplings with chopsticks with 8 people eagerly watching . “what do you call these in english” she asks we teach her and she then teaches us how to say it in korean. i can feel her wanting to connect with us and it excites me to no end. we ask her her name. “ju anh sin. and you are?” “alex and she’s tamara” she says she likes our names and smiles. a girl standing right behind tamara speaks up, she seems nervous and talks louder than normal. “what are your jobs?” i tell her i’m in business (didn’t know how to describe digital marketing in a way they’d understand) and tamara told them she translates languages. we then tried to tell them that we work online on our computers. they really didn’t seem to understand this concept at all and ju anh sin made a sour look as if she wanted to ask more but didn’t know how. as we’re devouring the dumplings (which were actually quite good) my brain is going wild trying to think of questions i could ask her without offending / potentially endangering her. i’d read online that the waitresses are heavily monitored by north korean officials to make sure they don’t talk too much about the regime or try escaping. there was even an instance in china where they shut down an entire restaurant when one of the waitresses tried to escape into the city. so i decided to be careful with my words, and wait for her to ask the questions. “where are you from?” “we’re from denmark” tamara says. i agree with her, although i’m actually from the usa i didn’t know how this information would form her opinion of me and opted to go the safe route. however for the remainder of our conversation she kept referring to us as english and our hometown as england. we assumed that this was because of her not knowing denmark as a country and only understanding the part where we said ‘in europe’. she then tells us she’s from pyongyang and used to study ‘beauty’ there. i’m still not sure what she meant by beauty. “do you speak chinese?” i laugh and tell her no, only english. she seemed genuinely confused by this. i asked her how she knows chinese and english and she says she learned while in pyongyang, that it was very hard to learn and took her a lot of work. she’s been teaching herself english since she got the job at the restaurant and it’s been even harder to learn. we eat a bit more in silence, all the while still surrounded by the entire staff of this restaurant. they talk to one another in korean, i’m assuming debating on questions to ask us. out of no where she hits us with a weird one “do you like badminton?” “yeah! we love sports like volleyball and football” she smiled at volleyball but made a sour face when i said football. probably the most sour face she makes during our entire conversation. the dumplings were running out at this point. i’m still debating what to ask her but can’t come up with many safe questions. “do you miss home?” i finally ask. she tells us to wait a minute and runs off for a few moments. she does this each time we ask her direct questions about her home or living conditions. “yes very much” she says in an extremely genuine voice. there was even an ounce of longing in the way she said it. i follow this with “have you travelled much?” “only to china.” she says a bit sad. she tells us it’s her dream to travel more and see england. “have you seen much of cambodia?” i ask “only angkor wat” she says. i’d read online that they’re forced to live on the restaurant premises and are very restricted with what they’re aloud to do. it was at this point i began to feel sad for her, living in this country for two years and only ever having seen one small part of it outside of this prison cell of a restaurant. dumplings finished and the main courses come out. both are actually very good dishes, mine tasted like a giant bowl of kim chi with fish and tamara’s was a plate of beef with a roasted pepper sauce that actually blew me away. she told us that the recipes come from north korea and are highly secretive. surprise surprise. this restaurant is like a small personification of the country in so many ways. “have you ever eaten dog” she asks out of nowhere as we’re taking our first bites. tamara’s face sinks as she considers the possibility that she may have a chunk of puppy heading towards her lips. “is…is this dog meat?” we ask collectively. they all laugh and tell us it’s beef. she clarifies that she was asking if we would eat dog meat to which we say maybe. the waitresses can’t stop laughing at this question, i think they’re used to tourists freaking out at the concept but we played it cool…or at least tried to. a bit more silence as we start eating “english men usually eat with knife and fork” she points out as i’m awkwardly fumbling with chopsticks. we all laugh at this, i joke about how i’m still practicing. this was the point we began to become much more casual with one another. she seemed unafraid to just ask us anything that came to mind and didn’t feel like our server anymore but more of a friend. she tells us she’s 20 years old. we tell her her english is very good and she blushes giggling and saying thank you over and over. this is the typical response she gives when complimented, huge thank you’s as she sinks her head into her chest and touches her heart like i’d just proposed. after the compliment she opens up a book she’d been holding the entire time and shows it to me. i had just thought it was a wine list but it was actually a note book she had been keeping for two years. it included thousands of english phrases neatly written in rows of three with their corresponding korean and chinese translations next to them. i see the phrase “can i get you water sir?” among many other service based phrases. the notebook was worn out and old looking and it was made in such a way that i believe she was literally just collecting english words from various customers coming into the restaurant. perhaps this is why she asked me how to say dumpling before. “wow this is…amazing! did you do all of this?” she blushes again and says yes, telling us she loves learning english. her passion for learning really impressed me, the way she goes so out of her way to learn and the perfection of the notebook took me off guard. she’s truly driven. “do you have any hobbies?” she asks. “yes tamara plays guitar and i play drums” she smiles huge and tells us she plays drums as well. she goes on to tell us she plays in the restaurant’s band and that it’s why she was chosen to work here. she plays every sunday and invites us to come see her play this sunday. we agree and i plan to hold up the agreement. she smiles very large and says “it was so so good to meet you” it felt amazing when she said this, like we had genuinely made her day. “it was so good to meet you too, ju anh sin.” i respond trying to emphasize how much i actually meant it. “you should come back in one year to cambodia to visit me again.” i didn’t really know how to respond to this. in my heart i know i almost would come back here just to see her again. this girl, from a society i could never imagine, i had endless questions for her. what i would give to get her out of these walls and just speak as two humans. “maybe we will! we love cambodia and we’d love to see you again if we can” she seems disappointed by my non-direct answer but satisfied. tamara asks for the check, i’d totally forgotten she was our waitress and it felt unnatural to ask her for something like that. i realize at this point that i had been eating way more than my body could handle trying to extend our time together with ju anh sin as much as possible. she comes back with the check and we’re leaving way too early. i could have spent the entire night at this table. she’s laughing and keeps saying how good it was to meet us. she even put her hand on tamara’s shoulder as we walked out, we promise we’ll see her again on sunday for her performance. i’ll make sure i’m there to see her again. as we’re leaving the restaurant i’m walking on air. i’ve never felt this feeling before, complete surrealism and disbelief. just a few days earlier i’d finished reading [nothing to on a beach in vietnam wondering what i would say if i could talk to someone from the dprk and suddenly there it is, an opportunity that i’d never imagined could exist without somehow getting into the reclusive country itself. i’ll always cherish this experience as long as i live and use it to help me humanize the millions suffering in the country to this day.",none,5

it's all non-speak. it's not a real plan because it's lacking details. am i expected to go through every page on her site and add up every number? &gt;clinton's new college compact plan costs in the range of $350 billion over 10 years and will be fully paid for by closing tax loopholes and expenditures for the most fortunate. what loopholes? what expenditures? there is no real information here, and this is exactly how sanders wants to pay for his plan. &gt;we need to make ambitious investments so that cost is no longer a barrier to college education, and the burden of debt does not hold back everyday americans. this is meaningless drivel. is she seriously talking about betting tax money on more ""investments""? &gt;more than half of the total will go towards grants to states and colleges. half of what??? her ""investment"" this is scary! her college plan is based on betting money. &gt;these grants will ensure that students do not need to take out loans for tuition and that support will also help reduce the burden of living expenses at 4-year public colleges. how? she doesn't know what the number will be. &gt;they will provide free tuition at community colleges, support private non-profit colleges that keep costs low and provide value, and relieve debt for students who commit to national service. again: how? she's not really explaining where the money came from or how much it will be because she doesn't know. &gt;these new grants will be paired with holding states and colleges accountable for bringing down costs. ah, so she will place some of the burden on the states and colleges themselves, another unpredictable variable in clintons wild ride. &gt;around one-third of the funds will go toward relief on interest from student debt. a third of what???!! this entirely depends on her ""investments"" paying off. load of shit. &gt;this includes allowing every american with outstanding public debt to refinance their student loans at today's low interest rates, cutting interest rates to reflect the government’s cost of debt, exactly what sanders wants to do. &gt;and making it far easier for students to enroll in income-based repayment that limits crushing debt. still don't know how, but okay... &gt;the remaining funds will support innovative new investments to create a higher education system for the 21st century. that means new funds to expand new models of life-long learning, rewarding college completion and enrollment, and broadening support for student parents. #where is the comprehensive plan hillary?

950f2d8c-eb9d-4150-9c71-c0a5efbdc5c7,"since the ny times rated it the top place to go yesterday, i thought r/travel could use a comprehensive post on mexico city. share your recommendations!","i wrote an email about mexico city to share with friends a while back that i've been adding to for the last couple of years every time i visit. i'm copying it below. this is by no means comprehensive or a definitive guide, just one person's taste. please comment with additional input and awesome places to visit in and around mexico city and i will add to the list. **where to stay?** i highly recommend that you stay in an airbnb or hotel in either condesa or roma norte. third option would be centro historico. condesa and roma norte are the neighborhoods with the best food and nightlife and you should spend some time walking around them both (ignore the fact that i didn't include them below). they're both completely safe. definitely walk around parque españa in condesa and down av. álvaro obregón in roma. for budget travelers, /u/johnnytrupp recommends [hostel in centro. **must-dos?** the four things that i consider required, regardless of the sights that you see: (1) drink mezcal, (2) eat tacos al pastor, (3) eat chilaquiles for breakfast, (4) visit a mexican market. if you can handle it, i would add to that to eat street food like tamales or churros, and get some fresh juice (agua fresca). but be safe about it. only eat street food that's cooked in front of you, no raw fruits or vegetables on the street, though you might have to make an exception for the juice. be careful of anything washed in tap water or served with ice (ask if it's filtered). i eat street food every time i go down there, but i have a pretty strong stomach. anything you get in restaurants, including water, is going to be fine. **anything else?** i recommend taking uber, not taxis. taxis in mexico city can be pretty sketchy and might rip you off. uber is also much cheaper right now. you'll need cell data, so buy a sim card at the airport or call your phone company before you travel and have them turn on data for mexico. if you're looking for places to eat or stuff to do that isn't on this list, people use foursquare way more than yelp, so check there. here are some lists (i list stuff in order of my own personal preference, best stuff near the top on each list). **sights:** * **teotihuacan:** awesome pre-aztec, mesoamerican pyramid ruins just outside of the city. easy to rent a car or book a tour or just catch a bus. i recommend renting a car, especially if you are traveling with someone else, but i love to drive even in crazy city traffic. if you want to catch a bus, just head to the [north bus and ask for the buses that go there. (thanks /u/visor2040 for the correction.) * **mexican markets:** i could have put this under restaurants, but mexican markets are an experience in and of themselves. you should definitely see one. **mercado de san juan (centro)** is a particularly good one, especially for a meal, so is **mercado merced (centro)**. but there are a million others so do some research. there's also a great street market every tuesday morning in condesa. if you want to do souvenir shopping, try **ciudadela market** in centro (via /u/oax_mike). * **el zócalo:** the main square in centro histórico with the **national palace** and **metropolitan cathedral**. there are also some visible ruins of the aztec city tenochtitlan here. * **coyoacán:** besides condesa and roma, this is my favorite neighborhood (better in the daytime than during the night). check out the main square, the **frida kahlo museum**, and the **trotsky museum** if you have time. the market in this neighborhood, **mercado de coyoacán**, has incredible tostadas and you should probably also eat a churro from one of the stands you'll walk by. if you go on a saturday, also be sure to head to the nearby neighborhood of san ángel, which has a cool bazaar and art fair. if you're a movie or architecture person, **cineteca nacional** is not far. * **biking reforma:** if you're in mexico city on a sunday, the city closes reforma (the main street of the city) and some other roads for bikers. definitely rent a bike and ride around. * **lucha libre:** i highly recommend this. on every wednesday and friday there are mexican wrestling matches at **arena mexico** (roma norte). they are absurd and offensive (think wrestlers that are walking stereotypes throwing little people around), but fucking awesome. if you go, pony up for some of the best seats as they're not that expensive and it's good to be close. * **xochimilco:** get a boat, cruise around and day drink. this place is especially good if you have a big group of people. the boats cost $350 pesos per hour (not per person). they always try to rip off tourists that way, don't let them. if they try to rip you off call the numbers (if you speak spanish, i don't know if they speak english) or complain on their twitter/facebook. (credit to /u/visor2040 for additional info.) * **national museum of anthropology:** i'm not a big museum person and actually have never been here, but everybody raves about this place. it's in **chapultepec forest**, which is awesome in its own right, and near **chapultepec castle**, which is /u/ohtheplacesiwant2go's favorite place. * **mariachi:** the best place to see mariachi music is at **plaza garibaldi (centro)**. be prepared to run into tourists. if you want to try pozole, which is a delicious and ancient mexican soup dish, there's a place nearby called **el pozole de moctezuma** that is well known for it. * **the top of torre latino:** this is one of the tallest buildings in the city, in centro, and will give you a great sense of how big mexico city actually is. protip: to skip the line, tell the elevator attendant that you are going to the restaurant/bar, the views there are just as good. * **palacio de bellas artes:** also in centro, this is a stunning building with some incredible murals by diego rivera inside. if you like art and architecture, check this place out. * **nevado de teluca:** if you like a hike and beautiful scenery, drive about two hours outside of mexico city to this 4,700m volcano and crater lake. [more info on (via /u/ohtheplacesiwant2go). **restaurants:** * **tacos al pastor:** you must eat tacos al pastor. almost any place you go is going to be pretty good, but some of my favorites are in condesa, including **el tizoncito** (there are a lot of el tizoncitos in mexico city, but the original one is at tamaulipas 122 in condesa and considers itself the inventor of the dish), **el farolito** (altata 19), and **el califa** (altata 22). these three are close enough together to do a ""taco hop"" one night if you want to try them all. if you're up for more of a trek, you should try **el vilsito (universidad)**. some of my friends consider this the best late-night tacos al pastor place in the city. this is a place you should go after the bar, post-midnight. it's a bit off-the-beaten-path, but worth it if you want food in the middle of the night * **pujol (polanco):** this place is rated the [16th best restaurant in the has three michelin stars, and won't break the bank (via /u/hungryone). * **tres galeones (roma norte):** awesome fish tacos. great lunch spot. this is one of my favorite places and i go here almost every time i'm in mexico city. (if you want more of a hole-in-the-wall, a block away is a place called **chico julio** that also has great fish tacos and burritos.) * **maque (condesa):** another one of my favorite places. this is a breakfast or brunch spot. get chilaquiles (the best hangover food in the world) and the amazing cinnamon roll type pastries i forget the name of. * **la tlayudería (roma norte):** great, authentic oaxacan food. try chapulines (fried grasshoppers). they're actually pretty tasty and a very common thing for folks to eat in mexico. * **casa de toño (zona rosa):** /u/myallurement says this restaurant is a ""must"" and that there are many cheap, delicious options here, like pozole, flautas, sopes, agua de horchata, etc. for dessert don't forget to try ""el flan de la abuela."" * **azul historico (centro):** this is a place pretty frequented by tourists, but that's because it's really good. there is also a great set of higher-priced shops on the second floor. * **el parnita (roma norte):** if you are not into street food, this is a great restaurant to try authentic mexican food. you can also try mezcal amores here, which is one of the most popular mezcals in mexico. afterwards, head to mercado roma nearby to eat a churro with hot chocolate or just grab a beer in the terrace (via /u/myallurement). * **yuban (roma norte):** another place with fantastic oaxacan food and great cocktails. a little more expensive than tlayuderia if you want a more classy restaurant. * **restaurante el cardenal (centro):** considered one of the best restaurants in mexico city if you want traditional food. this place has great food all day, but especially breakfast. try the escamoles (i'm not going to tell you what they are). * **mibong (condesa):** if you want to get away from mexican food for a night, this place has pretty good thai fusion. * **butcher &amp;

c8a5810b-3246-4981-a594-fbb8c277d4b6,what are the biggest culture shocks people face when coming to germany?,"i've been in berlin for about two months now. here’s my longish list: i started learning germanbefore coming here. people said i was wasting my time, that everybody here speaks english. that’s not true. many germans don’t speak english. also, a number of people (usually officials or clerks) were upset that i don’t speak their language yet, as if my not having learned the language yet in the span of two months is some grave offense. maybe it’s only this year but the summer isn’t really summer. there are hot and cold days. sunny and overcast days. clear and rainy days. a day can start sunny and end in rain. you can walk out in your shorts and have to wear pants and a light jacket by the end of the day. also, the days are unbelievably long. the sun rises before 5 am and sets at around 10 pm. wwii and the holocaust. i am of jewish descent. many of my ancestors were taken to auschwitz and other camps to be exterminated. i remember the first time i saw a stolperstein or “stumbling stone” in berlin (these are brass plates inscribed with the names of jews and information about the dates of their deportation and extermination, inlaid in the pavement outside their last place of residence) i froze. my heart sank, and a deep sadness welled from within me. ethnic diversity here is wonderful. there seem to be people from all over the world, all co-existing. yes, there have been some glitches, but seeing this melting pot of diversity brings hope to the heart. plus, you can have authentic food from almost anywhere—from mexican to vietnamese to turkish to lebanese to korean, etc., etc. many, many people are tattooed, so much so that un-tattooed individuals seem rarer than tattooed ones. and so much so that i sometimes wonder if even the businessmen and women, under those fine tailored suits, are hiding some large and colorful dragon or tiger adorning their skins. i assumed berlin would be cleaner. before i came i had a vision of germany as a glinting-clean place. and although it’s not filthy, there’s some wastestrewn about in parks and on the streets—empty beer bottles and food leftovers and dirty plastic packaging, etc. and speaking of beer bottles, people drink alcohol. a lot of it. i see many people walking around with some kind of drink in their hands, or people sitting outside bars or even in parks with an unbelievable amount of empty bottles by their side. or in supermarkets, walking out with cartfuls of booze. maybe i notice it more because i’ve never lived in a place with so many churches, but there are so many of them here. imposing ones with rising spires and crimson bricks and huge bells resonating blocks and blocks away. having grown up in israel, i find it hard to imagine how the visions of a carpenter in the middle-east, over centuries and millennia, transmogrified into these massive, gothic places of worship in a completely different culture and milieu. the other day we went to a pleasant park and there were a bunch of kids playing in the nude, splashing each other with water and running around in the sand giggling. my son took off his clothes and joined them, and i thought, how wonderful that no one is embarrassed seeing naked kids playing around, that they are granted this easy, unconscious freedom that in many other parts of the would would have been considered inappropriate. sex seems to be less of a big deal here. i’ve seen a number of adverts in the street depicting some form of sex in illustrations. in the us, there would have been a lecherous quality to it, some kind of cleavage or exposed thighs, something to suggest and tease and taunt. but here there is something unassuming about its depiction—a couple or even a threesome lying in bed covered in blankets, a cartoon of a man with his loins covered by a popping champagne bottle and a smiling woman by his side. unassertive—as if this, too, is a natural part of life and there’s no need to make a fuss about it. organic food is available in most supermarkets and is not necessarily exorbitantly priced. in fact, almost every little place that serves food will have some kind of organic lemonade or soft drink. although i am not vegetarian, when i came here i imagined würste (sausages) everywhere, and a dearth of other, non-pork based offering. but, in fact, it is very easy to get vegetarian food here. from vegetariangemüse kebap (turkish food—vegetables in bread) to vegetarian asian dishes, to tofu, grain- or legume-based meat substitutes in supermarkets, it is not only possible to be vegetarian here, but even easy. the streets and the curb are wide and spacious, oftentimes cobbled and shaded by evenly-distanced stately trees. having grown up in israel and lived in india, this was novel for me—this european expansiveness. some people can be incredibly proper and strict here. i’ve been scolded for standing out in the street when the bus came, and then for standing in the wrong place inside the bus as i was paying. in some places and settings people are expected to behave in a certain ways, and are frowned upon if they are not. the bicycle is a serious mode of transportation with its own lanes and a substantial number of riders. drivers are not as courteous as in other places—in less trafficked streets with no stoplight, and unlike the us, cars will mostly not stop when they see a pedestrian, and one has to wait for an opportunity to cross. things are well made. the walls of the apartment i’m staying in are almost as thick as my outstretched arm. the woodwork is precise and sturdy. some of the buildings around look like they’ve been in existence for centuries, and that they will last for many centuries more. there is an assuring sturdiness in the material existence here—like things are dependable and robust. also, it is not difficult to find objects that are made in germany or europe—be it knives or rucksacks or wallets, etc.—that look like they will last for a lifetime. i like that. almost all shops are closed on sundays. parcels are left with neighbors. if you’re not in and you have a package, it will be left with one of your neighbors, who will then, perhaps later in the day, come knocking on your door and claim the package with a slip. people have been incredibly helpful. when i arrived, a neighbor helped carry our luggage from the street. another neighbor helps me whenever i need something in german translated. i’ve had people in the street, after asking for directions, pull out their phones, search for the place, and give me clear instructions. of course, as with everywhere else, there are also unfriendly people, but the friendly and helpful ones have left a greater impression on me.",none,5

9c75a7b5-4713-45c2-931d-c94409bcde82,advice and a word of caution for indians thinking about the student route to immigrate to canada,"i recently saw a popular post on immigration strategies that listed canada as the easiest country to migrate too. i want to provide some more context to this ""very easy"" strategy. my goal is not to discourage anyone from immigrating but to provide awareness of the challenges most commonly faced by indians that the student route to obtaining permanent residency status in canada. **context** college and university in canada are two very different things. colleges offer diplomas, certificates, and maybe some 3 year degrees. universities offer 4 years degrees (ba, bsc. etc.) and masters/phd/medical/law etc. programs. in canada colleges are popular with people already in the workforce, university graduates looking for specific skill certifications, and people looking to enter non-office jobs. until recently most international students in canada enrolled in universities not colleges. but recent changes have opened up a new route of enrolling is college diploma programs where upon graduation they hope to fulfill the requirement of 1 year work in canada (any field) after which they can apply for permanent residency. this has led to a huge increase in international students from india. up until the early 2010s india, china, and philippines all sent around ~30,000 immigrants to canada a year. now china and the philippines remain at ~30,000 while india has shot up to ~85,000. this boom has had implications potential indian students should be aware of which i will now discuss. **the trap some indian students enter** canada is a great country, no doubt. but when it comes to living here there are some challenges. those challenges are... 1. limited job market: it's a small country, very spread out 2. competitive job market: huge number of recent immigrants + a decline in some sectors like oil means competition for any type of job even low-pay ones can be surprisingly strong 3. expensive housing: cities like toronto and vancouver are extremely expensive, small towns and cities are cheaper, but the job market is worse. also the influx in students mean many areas surrounding colleges are now expensive due to high demand. 4. the lack of recognition for indian education or experience: unfortunately indian education is not respected here, and i've seen indians with masters degrees and job experience have to enroll in bachelor programs all over again. only exception is if you've experience with a multi-national company, one that the typical canadian will have heard of. unfortunately many students do not fully understand the situation they are entering. so they enter the following trap. 1. your family takes on expensive loans or sells property to send you to canada to do your education 2. you enroll in a diploma course from a small college somewhere that has limited value and recognition 3. you graduate and enter canada's very competitive job market and find white collar jobs are next to impossible to land, and you must settle for blue collar ones (trucking, factory, fast food, drivers and delivery men, women may also do maid/elder care jobs). 4. because your parents spent so much money to send you here you cannot just come back, but you find yourself stuck at the bottom of the ladder. living costs are high and there may be an expectation to send money home so saving money is a challenge too. now of course every student comes thinking they will make it, and they will as hard as it takes. which is great, but most of the students trapped what i just described thought that way too. you may also say low wage work in canada is still better than india. possibly, but it's definitely not an easy life when you spend every day working at multiple low wage jobs just to make ends meet. i've heard some say if they worked this intensely in india they could've probably ended up somewhere better. for canadian colleges these students pay much higher tuition than domestic students so they bring in a lot of additional revenue for the country, further more canada has fewer young people and university is becoming more popular than college. many colleges have no been recruiting indian students just for the higher tuition they pay, so they can survive. **backlash** furthermore the enormous sudden influx of indian students has created some backlash. in small towns these students can overwhelm the local job market competing with the local working class population, and making the limited job pool even more competitive. in cities the students usually settle in older indian neighborhoods home to pre-2010 immigrants and canadian born indians. here too job competition increases and the result is the older indian community has also become hostile against indian students. several articles in canadian and indian media have described the tension between indian-canadians and indian students. this often combines with accusations of crime and deviancy. here is one article: **covid-19** covid-19 has resulted in millions of jobs lost, the worst canada has seen in 100 years. if the job market was competitive before it will be ultra-competitive for the future and international students will find themselves at the bottom of the hiring process. here's an article: this situation will take at minimum 5 years to rectify, especially when you consider how many small shops and restaurants have permanently shut down. **advice for potential students** 1. **consider a graduate program from a university**: the college route is the fastest and simplest but also leaves you with the least valuable certification. in a country where even domestic mbas spend 2-3 years looking for a good position a business diploma from a small college no one has heard of will not impress anybody. maybe your fine doing blue collar jobs instead of an office job, okay but remember covid-19 created 2.5 million unemployed canadians who you will now compete with in addition to thousands of fellow students. doing a degree in india, from a reputed school, and then doing a masters in canada is the best route for securing good employment. it might take a few years but it's a better chance of success. in canada job experience is highly valued so select masters programs that include mandatory internships or co-op place mats. it will give you the canadian experience that can be so hard to get for immigrants. ps. cheating is hard in canada, and professors have little sympathy for sob stories about how you need to pass because you can't go back to india empty handed. as more cases come to light schools are cracking down, and the press is harming the reputation of hard working students. 2. **maybe hold off on coming here till a few years after covid-19**: the job market in india has been hit by covid-19 sparking interest in going abroad, but recognize the job market in canada is pretty awful right now too. no sense in dropping huge sums to end up in a foreign country unemployed, or just barely scrapping by on a low wage job with no security. 3. **job prep from day 1**: look out for any opportunities for internships, job training, certificates programs from day 1. don't think of this as something to worry about after graduation. in many cases this can be the difference between success and failure. i've seen several indian student spend their student years not especially focused and then spend 3 years after graduation working 14 hours a day working 3 different retail jobs. 4. **network outside the indian student community**: the broader your network the more unique opportunities pop up. it can be a challenged, cultural barriers exist and it can be much easier to settle in a friend circle of fellow indian students. there's also the challenge that some canadians and indian-canadians look down on immigrants. but if you make an effort you will find new friends. 5. **avoid crime**: goes without saying, but increasingly a few students have entered illegal sectors like drug trade our of desperation or frustration. sooner or later this will end very badly for you, and increasingly incidents like this have resulted in some landlords refusing to rent to male indians students in some small towns on the usa/canada border. one example, some indian students got into a drunk public fight over a petty issue. someone recorded it and it went viral, police identified them and they were deported. imagine your parents selling their land to send you to canada and you got sent back because you got in a fight over something useless. of course this is not to say every indian in canada fails. there is a huge middle class community indian community in canada and indian professionals are found in every field. this caution is more to avoid you making common mistakes then to say just don't come here.",none,5

(closures etc?) * all travel will be self-guided, however tours may be used for grand canyon / bourbon trail / yosemite. * the costs are adding up, and we are considering removing some days. what would be the things you would remove/change? * we are choosing to visit toronto, as we heard the canada side of niagara was better and i've always wanted to visit canada and we we were close enough so why not. we do intend to come back and explore it properly in the future. * i keep wanting to add chicago back in. but just can't seem to fit in in with our restricted timeframe and budget etc. any reason i should be convinced? thanks!!",none,5

a6d5e32d-dc2b-4479-bcc8-3f4299a287d2,megathread: press conference of four senior supreme court judges.,"an unprecedented event occurred today in the history of india. four senior sc judges came out against the institution in a pc. out of all links seems to be more comprehensive. let's have a mega discussion on this. edit: below is the full text of the letter .... it is with great anguish and concern that we have thought it proper to address this letter to you so as to highlight certain judicial orders passed by this court which has adversely affected the overall functioning of the justice delivery system and the independence of the high courts besides impacting the administrative functioning of the office of the honourable the chief justice of india. from the date of establishment of the three chartered high courts of calcutta, bombay and madras, certain traditions and conventions in the judicial administration have been well established. the traditions were embraced by this court which came into existence almost a century after the above mentioned chartered high courts. these traditions have their roots in the angle saxon jurisprudence and practice. one of the well settled princples is that the chief justice is the master of the roster with a privilidege to detemine the roster, neccessity in multi numbered for an orderly transaction of business and approriate arragements with resepct to matters with which member/bench of this court (as the case may be) is required to deal with which case or class of recongnising the privilidege of the chief justice to form the roster and assign cases to difference members/benches of teh court is a convention devised for a disciplined and efficient transaction of business of the court but not a recongnition of nay superior auhority, legal or factual of the chief justice over his colleagues. it is too well settled in the jurisprudence of this country that the chief justice is only the first amongst the equals — nothing more or nothing less. in the matter of the determination of the roster there are well-settled and time honoured conventions guiding the chief justice, be the convention dealing with the strength of the bench which is required to deal with a particular case or the composition thereof. a necessary corollary to the above-mentioned principle is the members of any multi-numbered judicial body including this court would not arrogate to themselves the authority to deal with and pronounce upon matters which ought to be heard by appropriate benches, both composition wise and strength wise with due regard to the roster fixed. any departure from the above two rules would not only lead to unpleasant and undesirable consequences of creating doubt in the body politic about the integrity of the institution. not to talk about the chaos that would result from such departure. we are sorry to say that off late the twin rules mentioned above have not been strictly adhered to. there have been instances where case having far-reaching consequences for the nation and the institution had been assigned by the chief justices of this court selectively to the benches “of their preference” without any rationale basis for such assignment. this must be guarded against at all costs. we are not mentioning details only to avoid embarrassing the institution but note that such departures have already damaged the image this institution to some extent. in the above context, we deem it proper to address you presently with regard to the order dated october 27, 2017 in r.p. luthra vs union of india to the effect that there should be no further delay in finalizing the memorandum of procedure in the larger public interest. when the memorandum of procedure was the subject matter of a decision of a constitution bench of this court in supreme court advocates-on-record association and anr. vs union of india [(2016) 5 scc 1] it is difficult to understand as to how any other bench could have dealt with the matter. the above apart, subsequent to the decision of the constitution bench, detailed discussions were held by the collegium of five judges (including yourself) and the memorandum of procedure was finalized and sent by the then hon’ble the chief justice of india to the government of india in march 2017. the government of india has not responded to the communication and in view of this silence, it must be taken that the memorandum of procedure as finalized by the collegium has been accepted by the government of india on the basis of the order of this court in supreme court advocates-on-record-association (supra). there was, therefore, no occasion for the bench to make any observation with regard to the finalization of the memorandum of procedure or that that issue cannot linger on for an indefinite period. on 4th july, 2017, a bench of seven judges of this court decided inre, hon’ble shre justice c.s. karnan (2017) 1scc 1]. in that decision (refer to in r.p.luthra), two of us observed that there is a need to revisit the process of appointment of judges and to set up a mechanism for corrective measures other than impeachment. no observation was made by any of the seven learned judges with regard to the memorandum of procedure. any issue with regard to the memorandum of procedure should be discussed in the chief justices’ conference and by the full court. such a matter of grave importance, if a all required t be taken on the judicial side, should be dealt with by none other than a constitution bench. the above development must be viewed with serious concern. the hon’ble chief justice of india is duty bound to rectify the situation and take appropriate remedial measures after a full discussion with the other members of the collegium and at a later state, if required, with other hon’ble judges of this court. once the issue arising from the order dated 27th october, 2017 in r.p.luthra vs. union of india, mentioned above, is adequately addressed by you and if it becomes so necessary, we will apprise you specifically of the other judicial orders passed by this court which would require to be similarly dealt with. with kind

d86d958b-e64b-4030-8dd0-ffdffe719c8c,"""pop goes the world"" by men without hats is an incredibly scathing commentary on how money and marketing corrupts the world.","""pop goes the world?"" you say. yes! yes, i know. but, trust me on this, follow along with me, it's worth it, i believe this song is truly brilliant, and is doubly brilliant in how it expresses itself. within &gt;men without hats was founded in montreal in 1977 as a punk rock band that little bit of insight gives us a glimpse at the artists' view of the world. a brief description of punk music &gt;often political, anti-establishment lyrics. now, the musicians are incredibly talented &gt;the doroschuk brothers, all three of whom are classically trained musicians so, they are very educated in the expression of art and messaging. &gt;the group's name came about because the brothers, following a self-described principle of ""style before comfort,"" also, hats were seen as a businessman's clothing. hats were a sign of conformity. now, let's look at the lyrical content of the song: &gt;""johnny played guitar, jenny played bass name of the band is the human race"" symbolically speaking about how all people, male or female are driven to create, to do what they are driven to do. the 'band' is all of us. &gt;""everybody tell me, have you heard"" like a marketing pitch. ""hey, have you heard the cool news?"" &gt;""pop goes the world"" success makes the world go round! you have to be successful and famous, for that is life. &gt;""jenny played keyboard, johnny played drums called little baby and a big bonhomme"" a child, dancing with a big bonhomme. little baby is being led by the embodiment of purity corrupted by advertising. i think the writer feels that bonhomme no longer represents art, but represents the monetization and selling of it to others. &gt;""johnny and jenny had a crazy dream see their pictures in a magazine"" now, they are told that their musical expression isn't enough, that they need to be famous, that they need to see others worship them. it's not their idea, it's a crazy idea. &gt;""jenny and johnny getting smart, it seemed make more money on a movie screen"" now, they are no longer pursuing their dreams of music, they are chasing money, because that is the smart thing to do. &gt;""every little nest needs a bird"" a commentary on how we are told that to have a complete life, we must have -----. &gt;""one, two, three and four is five everybody here is a friend of mine"" saying how that when you buy in, and start going along with the marketing, everyone becomes your friend. &gt;""whatever happened to the duke of earl another commentary on how art gets corrupted. the song is about love, no matter if there is money or not. that no matter what happens in life, the singer will treat his love like royalty. but, when the song became popular: &gt;after spending three weeks at number one on the billboard charts, chandler purchased a cape, monocle, cane, and top hat and advertised himself as ""the duke of earl"". the message became corrupted. instead of a message of love and art, it became embracing wealth and title, buying in. &gt;""send al gunn to see the doctor (ben) not sure about this as it is less symbolic and more specific, al gunn was a touring bandmate, who may have had conflict with dealing with record label talent stuff, so it may be a reference to dr. ben wheeler, a canadian doctor who helped keep the spirits up of prisoners of war. a message to keep the chin up while you're being tortured. &gt;""hey, what planet are we on (the third) asking what reality he is in, because everything looks so warped &gt;""and every time i wonder where the world went wrong end up lying on my face going ringy-dingy-ding-dong"" here is the honest expression of the song. every time he sits down to think about where the problems started, it's too complex to think about, it's too pervasive, the industry of churning artists into money machines is too big. &gt;""and every time i wonder if the world is right end up in some disco, dancing all night"" so, instead of worrying about the problems of the world, he looks to 'culture' to see what he 'should' be doing, and ends up in a disco, because it's 'cool'. &gt;johnny played guitar, jenny played bass ain't nobody couldn't take their place all human life is vital, and nobody is unimportant. nobody can be replaced by other artists, every person needs to be free to express themselves however they want. &gt;""pop goes the world"" but, in the end, everyone succumbs to a culture of marketing and buying, and due to everyone losing themselves, the world ends. the video makes this doubly clear: let's go over the symbolism in order of appearance * there are curtains, with a planet behind it. the curtains represent new life, the planet is new, fresh and bouncing. * the artist is kinda grooving, looking around in wonder at these magical bubbles, childlike, questioning. he's not dancing yet, but he's kinda moving. that's important. * now, the slide is the acceptance of marketing and life, agreeing to a ride you can't control. * the second he hits the world after the slide, he is dancing, and doesn't stop. it then flashes to a big bonhomme, with a stereotypical ""evil rich guy"" hat, who is playing a drummers' beat, and everyone is compelled to dance to it. * it shows a baby carriage being rocked back and forth by the beat, with an infant inside, expressing itself through music. * it then shows another musician, dancing with business, being guided by it, sliding down the slide. * the artist briefly angles his hands as if to say ""that'll be a great shot for the magazines"" * now, the artists are performing for the bonhomme. ivan leads the female to a pedestal, while dollar signs flash. this shows how marketing tells artists that they are more than human, they are elevated, something else. * ""every little bird needs a nest"", and ivan gesticulates to the bonhomme, asking if this is satisfactory, if this is a good image. * now, elvis appears, but it is elvis post fame, after he had embraced his 'image' * now, children of every race are brought out, with all sorts of stereotypical garb, representing humanity. * they are all ushered down the slide, and they are joined by bonhomme. * now, for the lament, ivan comes up to the camera, stops dancing, gets serious, and imparts the message of the song, telling the viewers about his thoughts. * the baby carriage comes down the slide, and now, all life is dancing together, with business, everyone losing themselves to greed. * the world ends. i hope this helps you appreciate it, i think it's a brilliant fucking song, and it's punk as fuck, but it's disguised. it's punk, but it's 'pop', to put a seed in the minds of pop fans, to have them think about music and art. look at ivan's face and expressions throughout the video, see the exaggerated movements when talking about pop, as if he is making fun of an executive telling him what would be most marketable. it became a smash pop hit, and was marketed, every step of the journey adding to the power of the songs' message. men without hats never had to dance to the beat to live again, this set them free, all the royalties etc. they were free to create art whenever they felt inspired instead of in a contract release schedule, and could live happily without having to worry about chasing fame for more money.",none,5

was it not curing aids in africa? are not such companies deserving of admiration, capable of making a profit and yet selling affordable medicines? ranbaxy was the backbone of a pharmaceutical sector of which we in india were told to be proud—and indians don’t need to be told twice to be proud of something. well, one sad and tragic day, the people who built ranbaxy decided to sell it to a japanese company called daiichi sankyo. the good people of daiichi sankyo had done their due diligence: they had inspected the books, talked to managers, toured the plants, and come to the conclusion that, yes, they were worthy of buying the gem that was ranbaxy, the first foreign company to sell generic medicines in the us. when ranbaxy was sold, there was much weeping and gnashing of teeth in india; a precious jewel had been given away for something as crass as money. india mourned. daiichi sankyo paid $4.6 billion for two-thirds of ranbaxy in 2008. they must have thought they’d got an exceptionally good deal—the very last act of selfless altruism performed by ranbaxy’s promoters. six years later, the japanese were glad to sell what remained of ranbaxy to one of its competitors, for $3.2 billion. the company had lost half its value in six years. it turned out they’d been sold a placebo. here’s a little bit of what was actually going on in ranbaxy, the pride of indian pharma. just a taste. in one plant’s supposedly sanitized room where medicines were made, there were flies ‘too numerous to count’.40 elsewhere, the refrigerators that were supposed to keep samples at a predetermined low temperature were broken, with pools of water from melted ice inside. some of the pills chosen at random and inspected had what seemed to be hair from an employee’s arm; others had compressed and mysterious black spots that turned out to be the oil that lubricated the plant’s machinery. and, to top off the ewww factor, one factory didn’t have any running water in the toilets, so no employee had been able to wash their hands for a really long time. remember, this is a medicine factory. meanwhile, it turned out that the medicines they were making weren’t just full of nasty stuff, they didn’t work to start off with. ranbaxy had to plead guilty to felony charges in the united states, because some of the medicines they were making were ‘adulterated’; they had to pay a $500-million fine. one by one, ranbaxy’s plants were declared unsafe; eventually not one of the four could still export to the us—the major market for its generic version of lipitor, taken by the millions of americans who’re watching their cholesterol levels. millions of ranbaxy’s lipitor tablets had to be recalled from chemists across the us when glass particles were discovered in them. craziest of all, it turned out ranbaxy had been methodically falsifying its test records. batch after batch of its generics was shown as genuine in the test documents—all of which were invented. regulators in south africa realized that aids drugs from the saintly people at ranbaxy were little better than placebos when all the test data for various different batches turned out to be identical—and photocopied. they didn’t even do a good job with the faking. well, sometimes they tried harder with the faking. on one occasion, they forged some documentation about data they had to show regulators, which was supposed to be from years earlier—and, to take that new-paper feel away, they aged it in a steam room overnight. in other words, in some parts of the world, it was just presenting completely false data. in brazil, of the 163 medicines that it was selling, it had properly tested only eight. every step of the way, ranbaxy behaved like a good indian teenager taking a test: it cheated when it could, and gamed the test when it couldn’t cheat. sometimes, former employees claimed, it would just buy brand-name drugs, and submit them to the fda as its own in order to pass the tests. all this was known to managers in 2004. two brave managers, both relatively fresh hires, launched an investigation; one eventually got to say his piece to the company’s board. according to fortune magazine, he told the board that ‘more than 200 products in more than 40 countries’ had ‘elements of data that were fabricated to support business needs’. he wound up urging a recall of major drugs, and coming clean to regulators. fortune says, ‘kumar completed the presentation to a silent boardroom. only one director, a scientist, showed any surprise about the findings. the others appeared more astonished by kumar’s declaration that if he was not given full authority to fix the problems, he would resign.’ naturally, he quit in two days. according to fortune, elaborate falsification of data was discussed at length in email chains that included ranbaxy’s ceo and a member of the family that owned it. on one conference call, when the uselessness of its aids drugs in africa was discussed, a senior executive apparently said: ‘who cares? it’s just blacks dying.’ remember, all this was, at the very least, known internally before ranbaxy’s owners sold it to the japanese. **as one us regulator said, the company’s culture was ‘corrupt to the core’**. i suppose it’s a small step from concealing the kind of drugs you’re making before you sell them to concealing the kind of company you’re running before you sell it. --source: restart india: the last chance for indian economy by mihir sharma _________________________________________ the former owners of ranbaxy now run one of india’s largest hospital chains (fortis healthcare and religare wellness). now, what is the reason of posting all this. one of my neighbors who is a 40 yrs old person had a bit of pain in his chest. he took some medicine but the pain kept coming after sometime. he went to get it checked in fortis hospital. the hospital doctors claimed he arteries in his heart were not working well and he immediately needed a bypass surgery. now this person is 40 years old with a bit of problem of high blood pressure. he got shit scared and even was thinking of getting it done. after all, a reputed hospital like fortis says; it must be true. one of his relatives is a doctor with another hospital. his consulted him before fixing the date for surgery. this doctor ran couple of checks and figured out, the pain was because of furniture he helped moving from ground floor to 3rd floor couple of days. just be careful guys. everyone out there is looking for opportunities to screw you up; especially these motherfucking big hospital chains. edit: many are asking for links. a simpl google search will give you relevant links. however, i would just post the links given by /u/lungithrow2 in the comments:",none,5

(this will cancel your us service, so it's best used for longer trips. or you can start using gv permanently in the us. *edit- if you are still under contract with your carrier, beware of early termination penalties and fees when cancelling your service.*) the transfer has a one time fee of $20. **you can only do this before you leave the usa.** (i am trying to pull up the page now to give you a screenshot, but since i am in italy, i get redirected. you can find lots of info on how to port your number elsewhere.) * download the hangouts app, and, if on android, also download the hangouts dialer app. (the hangouts dialer adds calling functionality to hangouts. on iphone, the dialer is included with the standard hangouts app.) * go to hangouts settings and click the google account which has your google voice number. scroll down to the google voice section and turn on the switches for incoming phone calls and messages. (you may also have to go into google voice settings in your web browser and turn on ""use hangouts for texting"" or something similar, i don't remember.) [hangouts * go abroad (or stay at home) and get a wifi connection, or purchase a local sim card with a data connection. now, as long as you have internet access, you can use the hangouts app to make and receive calls to/from us numbers. your friends won't even know you're abroad. (your data plan obviously won't be free, but the use of your us number is totally free. if you use wifi only, this solution is completely free other than the $20 charge for porting.) i've used it on both wifi and data, and call quality has been, other than the occasional echo, *indistinguishable* from a normal cell call at home. i mostly make calls while on wifi, but actually the data usage doesn't seem to be too bad. one caveat - you will need to put all phone numbers in your contacts into international format (+1...). otherwise, it will try to call the number in the local country. [hangouts * you can also text. if your international plan includes texting, you can text from both your foreign number and your google voice number from the hangouts app. this dropdown box allows me to send my response from my american number (sms via google voice) or my italian number (sms via sms). [number other cool features - you can call and text from your pc as well, using hangouts.google.com. voice mails are transcribed and displayed in your text message conversation. and you get emails for missed calls. when i return to the us, i'll probably stick with google voice as long as they offer it. edit - as many of you have mentioned, it is possible to get a separate google voice number and use that instead of porting. you can also use talkatone (may cost $) or get a skype number (costs $). for me, the biggest appeal of this was to keep my original number, but it's still quite useful even if you don't.",none,5

c84042f0-5605-47ca-94e1-ab17c424d5cd,"a guide to buying travel insurance. yes, you should buy it.","so i see a few posts about travel insurance and in an effort to improve my writing i've thrown together a guide. disclaimer: i accept no responsibility if you choose insurance from advice here. read your product disclosure statement (boring i know). &amp;nbsp; i'm taking about international travel insurance here but it can apply to domestic as well. &amp;nbsp; **should i buy it? (yes)** don't travel without it. if you can't afford to buy travel insurance you can't afford to travel. **but why?** if you hurt yourself overseas it can ruin your life. you don't want to be thinking about medical costs when your hurt or sick in country without any support. have a quick google for stories of people who didn't have travel insurance. don't ruined your time travelling by not having insurance. &amp;nbsp; not being from the us i don't know much about your coverage but here's a bit of information from the us gov: &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; here is a lovely infographic made by the uk gov about some facts and figures: &amp;nbsp; **what should you buy?** **short answer:** if your **company has a mutli-trip policy** that covers you for both business and personal travel -&gt; use it. if have a **credit card with travel insurance** -&gt; read the conditions (usually you must buy the plane tickets on the credit card). if you **don't have a credit card** (or have one that doesn't have insurance) or your trip is longer then 6 months -&gt; you should look at world nomards explorer (not their standard), or southern cross travel insurance (australia). (read the limits and conditions, and if you're happy with the limits, go with them.) &amp;nbsp; **long answer:** **what should i look for?** &amp;nbsp; * 24 hours assistance helplines to offer support and advice about appropriate treatment. * emergency medical treatment costs, including hospital charges and ambulance fees * returning you home following medical treatment abroad if you cannot use your original ticket *medical limits* be at least 2.5 million, ideally unlimited. *activity coverage* check it covers you for snow sports, white water rafting, or any other none standard holiday activity. *individual item limits* check the limits (the payout the insurance company will give) for individual items will be enough to cover your laptop or expensive camera. some insurance can cap out at $100. make sure you have copies of the receipts or serial numbers if you ever need to claim. *the clauses and conditions* this is a little boring but be careful. you might not be covered if you leave your stuff in the backseat of a car rather than in the trunk. make sure you do the boring work of reading your policy. it can make all the difference to your holiday. one time i couldn't claim my new ski jacket being stolen as i left it unwatched with friend when i went to get a round of drinks at the bar (world nomads). *pre-existing medical conditions* if you have any pre-existing medical conditions check they are covered as well, there is usually an extra fee. *car hire* if you're hiring a car, make sure your insurance will cover the car company's excess. *excess* most are around $100 per claim, so they won't cover you for smaller claims. some policies will let bring the excess down by paying more up front. it's more a comfort level, personally i'm happy for an excess of between 100-200 dollars. be awarw credit card insurance excess can be a little higher, around $250 per claim. *being foolish* hiring scooters in bangkok might not be covered. usually anything to do with unsafe activities (drinking and then going skiing at night) won't be covered. so read the damn fine print. &amp;nbsp; **buying it** make sure you get at least three different quotes. don't be scared into buying the first travel insurance you see. use comparison sites like comparethemarket.com, moneysupermarket.com, etc, to get a bunch of quotes quickly. **edit: has been suggested as a good way to compare north american policies. read some reviews on your insurance and see if people had problems claiming (productreviews.com.au for you aussies). if you do a few trips per year consider buying a mutli-trip annual policy as it usually works out cheaper. &amp;nbsp; personally i travel on my credit card travel insurance as i usually buy my tickets on credit card. &amp;nbsp; **travelling with it** keep a copy of the emergency numbers your insurance company will give you on yourself and in your suitcase. keep a copy of your policy number and any other documents you'll need. you don't want to be fumbling for this stuff when you need it. **comparision chart** here is a lovely comparision chart to show how different insurances stack up. &amp;nbsp; **more information** **uk** **us** hope you guys enjoyed my short guide to buying travel insurance with the main things you should look for. edit: if you have any good or bad experiences with companies please give a quick review.",none,5

so find a ratio that you’re comfortable with (say half &amp; half) and spend part of your time doing the “normal” stuff and part of your time seeking out experiences you won’t find in the travel magazines. for one thing…it’s pretty easy to visit the wonders of the world without standing in line or fighting the crowds. you do 1 of 2 things (or both): 1. wake up at the butt crack of dawn and be the first in line at the gates…and i don’t mean “early”, i mean the butt crack of dawn. not the metaphorical first in line – the literal one. butt crack of dawn. my wife and i were the first to get into machu picchu (not counting the hikers) and the first to get into iguazu and this affords you a good hour of the place being almost empty and really two or three good hours until the tour buses with the hoards arrive. 2. visit crazy popular places in the off-season. many big sites have multiple entry points as well. i went hiking for 10km on the great wall and there were points where i literally saw zero other humans. so don’t research alternatives to the big ticket items but instead research alternative ways of seeing them. **off-the-beaten stuff you'll find anywhere** here's a list of all sorts of things you can do once you're ""there"", wherever there is, to uncover non-traditional travel experiences. - go walkabout. just fucking walk around. no map. no destination. walk around. walk through neighborhoods. walk where ever the wind takes you. walk until you're tired and don't want to walk any more. take a taxi back to the hostel. - do any sort of adventure stuff. adventure stuff is automatically off-the-beaten-path, even if there are heaps of your smelly hostel mates already there. go for a hike. climb a mountain. go rafting or camping or any of this outdoorsy stuff. even if it's a guided tour it's pretty far off the beaten path. hell, the blue family won't be there. - speaking of hostels. if you're at a hostel you're already traveling off the beaten path compared to the majority of travelers. - go to shows. local events. smaller museums not listed in guidebooks. most cities will have a what's happening section in their newspaper...pick one up and buy tickets for a show. even if you don't speak the language. who cares? - keep your eyes peeled for flyers. from an underground(ish) flamenco show in seville to being one of 4 gringos many moons ago at the rodeo in oaxaca, i've found all sorts of cool activities plastered around town to telephone poles. see something interesting? just go. - you only need to walk 3 blocks to get out of the tourist district. even if you're staying right in the heart of the ""old town"" you can easily find local eateries by walking 5-10 minutes in any direction. - visit the supermarket. walk the aisles. ogle their funny foreign food. analyze pricing strategies and how they arrange the shelves/store. up the ante and wander into hardware stores, post offices and any other common every day business you can find. there's some interesting things to be seen if you use you eyes and your imagination. - meet locals. be gregarious. if you're not gregarious then get drunk and then meet locals. locals take you to local places. be careful letting locals take you to local places when you're drunk, though. - look for alternative lodging. from airbnb to boutique hotels, bungalows, house rentals and more, there are plenty of alternatives to a big hotel even if you're not the hostel/couchsurfer type (or if you're past that phase of your life). i don't know...to me going off the beaten path is more of a mindset than literally refusing to go to the most fabulous places in the world out of spite. yes...pepper in small villages and more obscure tourist destinations to your trip to go along with the stuff grandma and aunt susan already know about...but don't be so obsessed with making your own way that you miss out on some of the best the world has to offer.",none,5

9d2a8e2b-2cd0-40ba-8623-60ba30cbb03a,confessions on system of a down by serj tankian [from serj's facebook],"to original post &gt;confessions about soad by serj tankian &gt;we are extremely lucky mofos for our fans to want a record out of our ragtag misfit of a crew after all these years, at times demanding it. this of course has led to numerous rumors about the band and our inability to make a record together coupled with he said/he said excerpts from each of our interviews in the past and present at times by sensationalism seeking media who are in no way, let’s say, changing the world for the better themselves 🙂 &gt;so i’m going to attempt to clarify things for all of our sake once and for all hopefully without vilifying anyone in the process. &gt;it is true that i and only i was responsible for the hiatus soad took in 2006. everyone else wanted to continue at the same pace to tour and make records. i didn’t. why? for numerous reasons: &gt;1. artistic: i’ve always felt continuing to do the same thing with the same people over time is artistically redundant even for a dynamic outfit like ours. by that time i felt that i needed a little time to do my own work. i wasn’t discounting restarting the process with the band later. &gt;2. egalitarianism: when we first started out our creative input and financial revenue splits were close to equal within the band. by the time mezmerize/hypnotize came around we were at the diametrically opposite end on both with daron controlling both the creative process and making the lions share of publishing not to mention wanting to be the only one to do press. &gt;3. i wanted to leave the band before mezmerize/hypnotize for these developing reasons. this is why i personally don’t feel as close to the music on those records. there were songs i wanted to bring in but was hampered by unkept promises coupled by my own passivity at the time. &gt;time went by, we all did our own thing. my solo career gave me the confidence as a songwriter and later composer to re-visit soad from a position of strength at first just to tour and enjoy each others’ company, which we did and do so still. &gt;i knew they wanted to make a record, but given the past i was hesitant. at times there would be emotionally tinged outbursts by one band member or another mostly blaming me for the band’s inactivity. &gt;after a long time thinking and processing, about 2 years ago, i went to the guys with a proposition for a way forward as a band. &gt;i wanted to rectify the wrongs of the past and establish a way we can all be happy moving forward so i recommended the following: &gt;1. equal creative input: by this time i had released 5 of my own records and was a better songwriter musically and daron was getting better as a lyricist, so i said let’s each bring in 6 songs that all band members approve fully and work on them along with songs or riffs from shavo. &gt;2. equal publishing split: i personally feel that a band is an equal partnership and finances should reflect that. &gt;3. directors cut: whomever wrote the song makes the final decision after exhausting all types of ideas from anybody within the group. i did this because in the past, i’d bring in a song that would be morphed into an undesirable version that i myself would withdraw from consideration. &gt;4. develop a new concept or theme so that it’s not just a record but a full experience. &gt;(obviously i’m omitting many other details here like agreeing on the “sound” of a new record which we couldn’t do either as we went back and forth with songs by daron and myself. i remember sending lots of notes on songs by daron, mostly from his current scars on broadway record, most of which i didn’t consider applicable to soad etc, they played around with some of my songs-suffice to say i think we tried). &gt;ultimately i had to draw a line in the sand because i knew i could never be happy going back to how things used to be within the band. &gt;and as we couldn’t see eye to eye on all these points we decided to put aside the idea of a record altogether for the time being. &gt;my only regret is that we have been collectively unable to give you another soad record. for that i apologize. &gt;thanks for reading &gt;peace &gt;serj",none,5

a34237d4-2f69-4411-b042-54ec3ced012b,off the beaten path budget friendly destination - central pennsylvania,"hello all! i'd like to tout my region as a fantastic destination for many different people with different interests. central pennsylvania has more to offer than amish folk, harley davidson and hershey's chocolate. let's assume york county is the ""center"" of this area, and allow me to tell you about some amazing places to visit within a two hour drive. (adams county) gettysburg national military park: the gettysburg battlefield is in hot contest right now regarding all of the upheaval with current events. no matter what the monument landscape looks like when decisions are made, this is a must-visit. the auto-tour will take most of a day, and give you a comprehensive understanding of the battle and the men that fought there on either side. the ""high water mark"" and the field that saw pickett's charge are quite moving, as well as little round top and devil's den. town has so much to offer as far as antiquing, food and drinks, trinkets, ghost tours, new age, and general tourist shops where you can buy anything at all relating to the civil war. the visitor's center offers talks and tours, and has many artifacts available to see for free without entering the museum with a fee. (dauphin county) pennsylvania state capitol complex: there are free tours available for this intricate building. it is a national historic landmark and the dome is a 1/3 scale replica of st. peter's basilica in rome. there's over 400 rooms to explore and the building houses many statues and artwork to peruse. the paris opera house's rotunda inspired the rotunda for the capitol building, and is a sight to see. not a free option, but the pennsylvania state museum and national civil war museum are also in harrisburg. if you're interested in a little drama with your history, read ""capital murder"" by chris papst before visiting the city. (lancaster county) more than just the amish: consider lancaster county for more than the residents. of course, shopping at amish markets for produce and furniture is probably going to be on your list, but there's more than the overpriced tourist shops along route 30. down the road in ephrata is green dragon farmer's market &amp; auction. there's so many stands here, you're likely to leave fully satiated and with a few new treasures for much less than you'd spend in most places. while not free, i also suggest the strasburg railroad, america's oldest continuously operating railroad. (york county) historic downtown york: come see the historically inspired murals among the colonial brick buildings downtown on your way to the colonial complex center. york was the first official capitol of the united states when congress fled philadelphia and met in york to adopt the articles of confederation, proclaim the first national day of thanksgiving and signed the french treaty of alliance. this town is steeped in history and conflict. on june 28th, 1863, just a few days before the battle of gettysburg, the confederates marched through york city, took it over and marched east toward the susquehanna river. at wrightsville, the citizens defended the bridge that spanned the river and stopped the enemy from advancing on pennsylvania's capitol of harrisburg and philadelphia. &amp;#x200b; if this gets much attention, i'd love to do more of these, since i am passionate about this area and love to share my knowledge.",none,5

2da6b905-c411-41f9-8cf8-89c080c441a5,my terrifying syria adventure,"many years ago, long before 9/11/01, when i was 20, my girlfriend and i went to london to get the cheapest flight to india, which turned out to be with syrian/arab air. the flight stopped over in damascus, where we changed planes. it was the first time i saw soldiers in an airport with machines guns -- they were everywhere. we wound up in a long line at the gate, and noticed a lone arabic guy, probably 25, who took a very keen interest in me. when i took out my u.s. passport his eyes bugged out, but he controlled himself when he saw us looking. we got nervous, wondered if we should tell someone, or not get on the flight, something. but what could we do? we boarded and chilled. then the same guy took the seat next to me. he pretended that nothing had happened, but i was petrified, tried not to look at him. the flight got underway, and i made small talk with my girlfriend. suddenly he tapped my shoulder. of course i jumped, but turned and tried to act natural. he tentatively asked me, in heavily accented english: ""you are american?"" i know some people say to always claim to be canadian, but i don't play that way, and in any event, he had seen my passport. ""yes, yes i am."" he nodded, seemingly pleased. then more confidentially, he asked, ""do you like [hwem]?"" ""um, [hwem]?"" ""yes, [hwem]!"" ""uh, i'm not really sure what that is..."" brimming with excitement, he went for his bag. i tensed up, then he pulled out a huge collection of cassette tapes, recordings by the pop group ""wham"". ""wham, wham, right?"" he asked. ""you know wham?"" i felt like such a dick. ""oh, yeah, wham! yes! great band..."" he was so passionate about this. ""i love wham! they are the greatest music. america is such a wonderful country..."" and etc. and etc. totally nice guy. we were both so embarrassed... *** i have since travelled the world pretty extensively, including in a few muslim countries, with generally positive and universally eye-opening experiences. since 9/11, however, and the recent events in france, i've been pretty disillusioned about the state of things, at times bordering on xenophobia when i look at what is happening in europe. i'm all for freedom of religion, though i have none of my own, but i would feel very uncomfortable to know that my local population was about to dramatically swell with people whose world view is so contrary to my own. but: the crisis in syria does also remind me of my one moment of terror in that country, and the degree to which that fear was self-created on my part through lack of understanding the human standing right next to me. it makes me more grateful than ever that i have been fortunate enough to see and experience so many parts of the world that are becoming less and less accessible, or must at least seem that way to the new generation of travelers. anyone who is torn between staying with a boring job vs. taking a risk and seeing the world should always do the latter, no matter what.",none,5

the longest i ever stayed anywhere was a couple weeks and sometimes i was only in a city for a night or two. whichever it was, it felt disconnected from the real world and all my friends back home. just another thing that happens on the road, i guess. overall, this trip was a big success. although i wanted to go on this trip, part of me felt like i was doing it because i had to. when i realized that if i didn’t do it now i might never, it was sort of decided for me. and even though i thought i was doing the right thing, i wasn’t sure that i wouldn’t regret leaving my job and apartment and everybody i knew to go to the other side of the world. but not only did i not get robbed, lose anything important, get sick, or anything like that, all of the intangible stuff turned out great too. i think i got a lot of personal development out of it – just maybe not in the ways i had anticipated i might. **being alone** while i was in hanoi i watched before sunrise, and there’s a quote in it that i liked a lot: ethan hawke, when he’s talking about traveling alone says, “you spend so much time looking out of windows, you have ideas you wouldn’t normally have.” it’s really true. i’ve always liked being by myself, so the solo aspect of it wasn’t too hard to get used to. there were times where i’d get lonely, but other travelers are always close by if you want. for the most part, it’s a chance to do a lot of thinking and self-reflection, even if it’s unintentional. one of the things that i thought about when i left was whether i’d still be interested in design as a career. like maybe i’d visit another country and decide that living on the beach and farming was the life for me, i don’t know. as it turned out, being able to step back from work a little bit not only reminded me that i do in fact enjoy it, it also gave me more clarity on the type of stuff i want to focus on. i realized that i wanted to focus on product work more than client work, that is, working on a specific product full-time rather than jumping around between different ones. along those lines, i also realized that i’d like to continue to grow my skills by becoming better at coding, to the point that i can more effectively build the things that i design. like i said, some of this came about by being able to take a step back from work. a lot of it came about by being forced to be alone with my thoughts on ten hour train rides. **what i liked about traveling** before i left, i wasn’t even sure i would like traveling. i mean, i’d traveled before, like in europe while i was studying abroad or on family vacations, but this felt like it would be different. i’d be moving around constantly, staying somewhere new every week, having to figure things out as i went, and never really getting the chance to get comfortable anywhere. it seemed like it would very different from other types of travel i’d done before. and that was all true, but it ended up being one of my favorite parts about the whole thing. always doing new stuff, always getting to explore; it was great. i don’t know a good way to write about the fun i had exploring new countries and everything that entailed, so i guess i’ll just leave it at that. i also loved the freedom of never having a schedule in place aside from the one i might choose to set for myself. there were times when i didn’t know what day of the week it was, something i never thought i’d experience again. i had time to do whatever i wanted: read, explore, wander, work. i enjoyed working because i was able to do it on my own terms. i found that i wanted to work because i enjoyed it, but i didn’t work so much that i dreaded it, either. for the most part i was able to find a good balance. in the more real sense, i loved stuff like being able to wander around a street food market and get an awesome meal for a buck, or arrive in a new city by myself without a plan and have to figure out what to do, or fit everything i owned into a 35 liter backpack, or sit at a street bar drinking watery asian beer and watching life go by. the list goes on, but i guess that’s what a lot of my blog has already been about. **coming home** towards the end of my trip, i felt a lot of weird emotions about coming back to the u.s. there’s a contradiction between traveling and not traveling that i don’t know the right answer to. while i was traveling, even though i loved it, i couldn’t not miss certain parts about being in seattle, like my friends and family and the city itself. at the same time, i knew that as soon as i got back and settled into the same routine, i’d miss all the parts of travel that were the exact opposite. i’ve continued to think a lot about it, and i don’t know what the right answer is. i do know that i’d like to do something similar at some point in the future, although i don’t have any plans for it right now. as excited as i was to return to seattle, i felt a lot of sadness knowing that everything i’d been through in asia would pretty soon be just memories. some of my favorite things that i did there weren’t the big trips or the tourist sights but rather the unspectacular moments, like sitting in a street food stall surrounded by sounds and smells or watching a busy intersection at dusk. stuff that’s hard to capture in a photo and that i know i’ll eventually forget. i can already tell i’m forgetting things, which is a bummer. somewhere on the internet i read about this word, saudade, that doesn’t have a translation in english. “it describes a deep emotional state of nostalgic or profound melancholic longing for an absent something or someone that one loves. moreover, it often carries a repressed knowledge that the object of longing may never return. it’s the recollection of feelings, experiences, places or events that once brought excitement, pleasure, well-being, which now triggers the senses and makes one live again. it can be described as an emptiness, like someone or something that should be there in a particular moment is missing, and the individual feels this absence. it brings sad and happy feelings all together, sadness for missing and happiness for having experienced the feeling.” i liked that word a lot when i read it, because it really captured how i was feeling at the time, and i’m sure a lot of people are familiar with the feeling as well. after all that, i was expecting to be depressed when i got back to seattle. but i guess i had gotten all of my thinking and philosophizing out of the way, because it didn’t affect me much at all. the hardest part was getting used to the cold and darkness again, but there wasn’t any reverse culture shock or anything. i miss traveling a lot, but it’s also good to be back. it wasn’t a glamorous trip – i ate dog, slept on trains, got woken up in the middle of the night in hostels, and looked like an idiot on more occasions than i can recall – but it was a great trip and even though i’ll never be 25 and in asia again, i hope that someday i can do something else that is so full of uncertainty and new experiences.",none,5

20d98bc0-8b7c-4f1d-a4e0-7945521d0713,tips for expressing yourself in english without special resources.,"i'm a c1 with no special training or exposure to native english-speaking environments, and you can be too! no special resources needed! i know zero grammar rules. i'm sure i make lots of mistakes every day and on this very post. but i'm no longer afraid to express myself in english (at least not any less than doing it in spanish). so, for me, who's never had the chance to actually sit down with a native to talk and get to this level, proves it's not impossible (and i assure you i'm not a genius polyglot or anything like that). so here, i'll tell you my tricks for how i took basic middle school english classes to a c1 all by myself (over the years, don't expect this to be magical). 1. think in english. in your head. it's very frustrating when you don't have the words, but even more so if you can't even say it to yourself. this helps with vocab and basic pronunciation! 2. write! write stories! write songs! write shameful fanfiction of the stuff you love! all in english! don't cheat and write in spanish first. i'm an awful writer but i had lots of fun writing terrible stories that have improved my english tremendously! you don't have to show them to anyone if you don't want to. just go out there and have fun! don't worry so much about grammar on the first draft. write as fast as possible and then go back and revise! 3. record a private journal in english! record yourself talking about your day, retelling that movie you watched or talking about whatever trouble you have! do it as if you're talking to someone else. this has helped me remember my day to day life and coping when i feel i can't talk about my problems with others, and of course, loosening my tongue. it doesn't matter if it takes you 30 min to say a few sentences, go for it and don't stop until it's done. then listen to it and try to work out what you want to improve from it! soon you'll be listening to them for fun, seeing how cool it is to be yourself and improve your english at the same time! i personally like the app captain's log by kookaburra gadgets (definitely not sponsored) to record (since i don't have to worry about space), but sadly, it's no longer on the app store. you'll have to download the apk from apkpure if you want to check it out. 4. twitter. just follow twitter accounts who only speak english. have your translating app on hand (only for words, never for sentences). you'll be learning all the fun online vocab in no time. (not instagram. or not only instagram. insta doesn't have the same potential for vocab as twitter does. if you can do both much better, though!) i assure you, these tricks have worked for me, who's put very low effort on actually sitting down to learn english. i hate studying from a book and learning theory. this approach takes time, but it ensures a natural and low-risk development of your skills. if you're too afraid to go out there and let yourself be heard or you just don't have the resources, then you can give these a shot. though i imagine throwing yourself out there does give you the fastest and best results. plus, if you know the grammar, you're already halfway there! do your best and don't be scared!",none,5

[some news stories got nobody knew to act on them. goldman sachs knew exactly what was in dodd frank. they &amp; the other financial institutions lobbied heavily to get the cftc to severely weaken the law about to be put into place. now, the new cftc proposal states nobody can own more than [25 percent of deliverable supply in the month nearest to of all the oil about to reach market. you got 81+ financial institutions involved in trading oil. why the hell are they allowed each to own 25%? this isn't price stabilization. this is pure greed. this hurts us. what is great for these financial institutions. before they really couldn't do this or they would get into trouble by the cftc if they were caught. now its going to be fully legal to do. the real story out there about oil shouldn't be that we might see $5 again this summer. the real story should be that its very possible we're never going to see $3 a gallon for gas ever again. this by far is the best fucking quite ever from the cftc: &gt;“you want speculation or you don’t have any markets,” said commissioner bart chilton in an interview today on bloomberg tv. “there’s nothing wrong with speculators. it’s when it begins to get excessive. we’ve seen where you can have **30, 35, 40 percent** plus in some markets with just one trader holding onto that concentration. that can impact markets.” are you serious? they've seen that someone can hold 30% and it can impact markets. so you're going to write a law saying 25% is fine. hahahahahahahaahah democrats voted for this bill. republicans voted against it. now, you know why wall street gives money to both sides in politics. you got democrats wanting the legalization on a smaller scale of what happened in 2008. you got republicans saying that a company like goldman sachs should be allowed to own more than 100% of the oil and the government should keep out of it. tldr;",none,5

[test pac, please is a section 527 political organization whose primary purpose is to raise and spend money for whatever political purposes you want. together, we can now: * air political advertisements on television * donate money directly to political campaigns and other pacs * do lots of paperwork now, to be honest, i was a bit peeved about the recent debacle in /r/trees because here i am, in the process of putting the finishing touches on a legitimate non-profit organization, and this guy broke all of your trust. so allow me assuage your fears: * we are registered with the federal government. our tax-id is 45-4126666 (i believe those of you on 4chan call that ""dubs"" or something.) * all of our financial activity is monitored and audited by the federal election commission, and every one of our expenditures will be published on you will see exactly where the money goes, as well as how much money we have. * is my steamid, is my personal website. if i break your trust, you are free to harass me to the ends of the earth. if i don't break your trust, please don't harass me though =d *** so what now? we need to (1) get money, (2) decide how to spend it, and (3) spend it. i'll cover these three points in order. **getting money** there are two ways that the pac can make money. first, we will be having monthly or quarterly fundraisers by selling products (either ""pay what you want"" or less than, say, $5) such as ebooks, all made/written by actual redditors who agree to donate a portion of the proceeds to the pac. the first fundraiser will start in about a week.the fundraisers will be posted in /r/rpac **by me** and i will ensure that the correct amount of proceeds are allocated to the pac, and post proof after each fund-raiser as well as the amount we raised, for security reasons. the pac can also receive funds 24/7/365 via dwolla or piryx. it's easier than using paypal, and instructions are on the pac's [donate if you have a service or product you'd like to use to (1) promote your product and (2) donate at least 50% of the proceeds to the pac, send an email to info@testpac.org. disclaimer: we cannot accept contributions from foreign nationals or government contractors, sorry. **deciding on how to spend money** currently, we do not have the infrastructure to decide how to allocate expenditures. most pacs meet in a board room, have a chairman, and take a vote. two problems. (1) we are on the internet, and (2) we currently have no voting system that is safe from 4chan or the mitt romney campaign gaming our voting system. for now, any of these discussions can take place in the pac's subreddit, /r/rpac. when i created the pac, i had three expenditures in mind: 1.) donating money directly to redditors running for political office, such as people: sean closson, dr. michael ham, jeff block, zachary meyer, jonathan wallace, peter marchetti, joel tyner, mike scala, and everyone else whose name i have apologetically forgotten to include here. 2.) running political advertisements on issues redditors are vocal about, such as sopa/pipa, cannabis prohibition, net neutrality, and preferential voting systems. 3.) funding causes like [directing which aim to educate and inform americans on citizenship democracy, and capitalism. democracy requires an educated and informed populace, and while some companies serve their interests by mis-educating and mis-informing, it is our duty to fight back by teaching our countrymen in a non-biased way. of course, this is a democratic organization, so *our expenditures are up to you, not me.* **spending money** this is the part i'm most excited about. rather than hiring video production teams and spending $50k on a commercial, we can hire actual redditors to do our work. we can put a post in /r/forhire detailing the project we would like completed, ask for quotes, and give the job to redditors. when products are completed, we'll post them on the official [test pac and then put the ad on tv or the radio, in magazines or newspapers, or on the internet. *** **tl;dr: we got a *** ama.",none,5

3412dad1-a520-47b4-8d97-4da84de789bd,"switzerland. my faq, thoughts, hints and tips after 1.5 years of living and travelling here.","based on questions that come up time and time again here is my faq, opinions and recommendation on a whole load of places in switzerland. this is not an absolute guide, but one based on what i have done and seen. it has slowly been put together as thoughts come to mind, and i will probably slowly edit it as other things come up. i am from the uk and am lucky enough to have been living in switzerland for a year and a half now for work. i have been travelling as much as possible all over the country [(very rough whilst i can, and i have seen more of the country than most of my swiss coworkers. i like to try and push the lesser-known spots: just going by the posts you see on reddit you would think the country only consisted of 3 or 4 places. i am a bit overly cynical at times with some places, but that doesn’t mean i don’t like them (and there are plenty of other posts raving about them elsewhere). i have posted a few times before that might be useful: * [a vast load of photos with * [my overview post of travel here in * [my guide to * see [this for information on moving here * see [this for yet more pretty pictures, and my submission history for more pictures still to various other subs. i have become somewhat obsessed with switzerland since i moved here for a number of reasons: * as is well know, the country is rather beautiful and easy to get around. it is also about as safe and friendly (in its own way) place as you can get. * having the time and (especially) money whilst being in the country is obviously a pretty big motivator. the prices are painful, they were especially painful at first when i converted everything back to pounds. * it is tiny, but there is so much of it. so many different landscapes and cultures. no other country has such a density of interesting things. glaciers, rustic alpine villages, and bright mediterranean style towns are only a short distance apart. * it its country of opposites. conservative yet liberal. quiet and withdrawn, yet social and loud. famous for being neutral and peaceful yet filled with military defences and installations…. **bonus point: we have snakes! venomous snakes too! and they can live up to 2000m up! i have almost stood on one near a glacier.** quick fire points: * [there are lots of useful internet-resources for getting around, figuring out what to do, and * **no town is so big that you need to spend days there, other than as a base to go elsewhere.** even the biggest cities can be basically done in a few hours (unless you really love museums and architecture). the ability to easily and quickly flow from city, to county, to mountain, and back again is what really makes it wonderful here. use a city for day trips out, then move on to another spot. the trick is to keep hopping around every few days. though not too fast: spending 2 or 3 days purely sat on trains to get to, go on the glacier express, and then back out of the country again is just absurd. * getting by with just english will be very easy in the main international tourist spots and on trains. elsewhere it can be a bit more hit and miss, though the swiss are very tolerant and will try to help there as best they can. any efforts to at least attempt a “bonjour” or “sprechen sie englisch?” will be much more appreciated than just diving in with english like it was the national language. [in most places the local language should be fairly if in doubt check what is written on signs or adverts (biel/bienne is the only place which is truly bilingual). also the number of people who speak two or more swiss languages with perfect fluency is much smaller than you might expect - so don’t expect french to work for you in appenzell. even along the french/german language border many people only speak one or the other. * shops close early. 6:30pm during the week is common, with shorter hours on saturday and most are not open at all on sunday. train-station/airport/petrol-station shops stay open till 10pm everyday. the opening hours also applies to things like dentists, if you are going to have an emergency try and do it early on a weekday (and with a few days written notice). * switzerland is not exactly cheap. it will hurt your wallet. if you are careful you can minimise the damage somewhat, but it is still much more expensive than its bigger neighbours. on the plus side everything is high quality at least. * paying for small items with a 100chf banknote is perfectly normal and will not offend shopkeepers (unlike when you pull out a twenty in the uk….). * transport is fairly expensive, but will get you literally anywhere in a reasonable amount of time. [look into sbb travel passes if you are going to move about the sbb phone app lets you buy discount tickets at non-peak times fixing you to a certain train but saving you up to 50%; combine this with the half-tax train pass for 75% reductions on train tickets. passes also apply either fully or partially to most boats and cable-cars, so are very useful to have. * accommodation is expensive. even the cheapest dorm rooms will set you back 25chf and up to 50chf is not uncommon (though all the yha hostels are very good quality and come with a good breakfast at least). figure 40chf per person as the very cheapest rate for hotel rooms (possibly with breakfast costing 10chf or more). double beds can mean two single beds, or a single frame with two mattresses and a giant hole - rarely does it actually mean a proper double bed. camping seems to start from 10chf per tent and 10chf per person. wild camping is not legal as such, as far as i know, though if you are not stupid, leave no mess, and do it in remote places nobody will probably know or mind (and ask the local farmer if possible to be polite). * food can be reasonable. eating out is expensive, but eating basic and/or supermarket foods will keep the price down quite a bit. as low as 10chf per day is probably doable if you really like bread and cheese (the bread and cheese here is rather good!). take-away food like kebabs start at ~10chf, and restaurant mains are ~15chf upwards in cheap places. traditional swiss foods like rösti or spätzli tend to be quite cheap. i tend to just pick a restaurant by a mix of price, type of food, and how nice the place looks - . * do not underestimate the sun in the mountains! little shade and thin-air are a dangerous combination for sunburn at any time of year. i thought that having just spent 6 months in queensland i would be immune to the sun, returning to work on monday my colleagues were delighted by the red-faced “typisch engländer!” in their midst. * walk for at least a few hours in a high meadow. it doesn’t have to be anything hard, but get out away from the villages and transport stations for at least a little bit to really appreciate the landscape. * if you are driving through make sure you have a swiss road-tax badge for the car after you enter the country, otherwise you might get a hefty fine. seasons: * weather – with both sides of the alps and jura mountains and so many valleys there is (almost) always somewhere nice in switzerland if you are prepared to travel a little. * may is a wonderful time with picture-perfect wildflower filled green valleys and snowy peaks. though it is off season in many places so access to high peaks and passes can be limited. * those perfect clear summer views you see in photos are a sadly rare sight. haze from the heat can really limit the view. my local mountain in the juras has a great view of the entire alpine range in winter, but you are lucky to see the closest peaks in summer. still beautiful, but be prepared to not see as far as you might hope. * be like a true swiss person and swim in the summer. lakes, rivers, pools are all good. just be careful as some places can be dangerous - check what the locals are doing first. * summer is a very lively time of year with festivals of every type all over the country. including the unfortunately named “blue balls” in luzern (still not sure if they named it that way on purpose or not). * autumn brings beautiful golden larch trees and possibly some snow in the mountains. the south ridge of the jura and places like napf are wonderful during this time: [colourful trees, and fantastic panoramas of the alps rising above the autumn mists * october-february can be very misty in the flatland due to temperature inversion. [you get sunshine, clear views, and a beautiful sea of cloud from above, but only grey fog down it varies place to place how bad it is (i live in solothurn where it is really bad by the aare). * in recent years there has been one or two short bursts of snow but otherwise nothing before the end of december. great for late hiking, less good if you fancy a festive ski session. * in the snowy months resorts have prepared walking/sledging paths for those who want to take in the mountains but (like me) don’t ski. sledges can be rented and the mountain routes are great fun (remember use a foot flat on the ground to turn). **part 1. the eternal bloody question: “luzern, zurich, interlaken, or jungfrau region (etc)?”** basically the cliché switzerland travel question “i have 2-3 days, which of these should i go to?” in short: all are very touristy, and if you have no experience in this country you will probably love any and all of them. this is a rather cynical review, i do like them (mostly), but there are plenty enough posts already out there raving about them all. in shorter: they are good (though i like other places in the country more), other than zürich and geneva which are best just used as airports. **jungfrau region** the photogenic tourist heartland, and what most people seem to mean when they think of switzerland. i can understand the hype; i was blown away when i first came here. but having travelled far and wide it has sunk down in my list of top places, and most swiss people that i talk to don’t rate it in their top places either. it is still one of my convenient go to places, i just wish other places got more attention. grindelwald, wengen and mürren are in a sense all very much the same - chalet filled tourist villages (with a mini supermarket in each) that offer fantastic views, and offer easy access to high wildflower filled meadows, walking paths, and cable cars, or winter sports depending on the season. grindelwald is the biggest and has by far the most shopping/dining options. mürren limits you a bit by being more out of the way and slower to get to/from. wengen has impressive views up the valley. lauterbrunnen village is the least pleasant and has the worst views (but a damn good coffee shop). generally speaking if you don’t know anything about the region, then just picking any of them at random should make you happy. * kleine scheidegg is the obvious go to. seeing the ionic eiger, mönch, jungfrau trio right in front of you is incredible, though i find that they are best seen from further away to really appreciate their size. i highly recommend walking at least as far as the eiger gletscher stop to take in the area and not just do it all by train. the area is however littered with vast amounts of skiing infrastructure which ruins it a bit for me. * jungfraujoch. the serious showpiece of the region. the highest train station in europe (not the highest point or highest mountain). expensive but amazing. [stepping out of the underground station and seeing this is utterly just make sure the weather is good or you will be paying 180chf each to see some cloud. if possible do not buy tickets until the last minute and go early or late in the day when it will be clearer and there will be less (relatively anyway) people – though be warned in the busiest days of summer i think it can sell out. the ride up stops at the eiger north face and glacier windows giving you plenty of time to jump out and take a look, most people are reluctant to leave at first so jump out quick to get the view to yourself for a minute. the inside has a few novelty walks and gift shops but generally isn’t very interesting. take waterproof shoes and walk along the prepared path from the observatory building along the path in the snow to monachjoch hut. takes 30(?) minutes each way and it is great to be out in the snow and mountains, and is fairly quiet as most people stay at the main building. but do remember that jungfraujoch is not the be all and end all of switzerland (honestly i think there are many places with better views and more to do high up), so if you miss out it doesn’t mean a ruined trip. * männlichen offers possibly the best viewing point in the area from the strangely themed [royal walkway]( a full view of the northern faces of the jungfrau region and beyond, looking down onto grindelwald and all the way up lauterbrunnen valley, and down to interlaken, thunnersee and the flatland and jura beyond. cable cars go up from grindelwald and wengen. you can walk along from kleine scheidegg without too much change in height (or walk from anywhere if you have the time and energy because this is switzerland). * lauterbrunnen valley is utterly stunning. walk from lauterbrunnen itself to at least the trummelbach falls to appreciate it from within. the trummelbach falls are well worth the entry price, though remember the temperature inside is cold even on the hottest day in summer. * lauterbrunnen village i find odd and not that nice. it was a bit of a let-down to me does not feel like you imagine it should from photos that make it look so nice. it is more like a transport hub and most people clear out upwards right away. i have yet to see the main street lively in any way. it is also home to big carparks and a campsite which detract from it quite a bit. the staubbachfall waterfall is a quick 5 or so minute walk from the station and you can go up inside the cliff at its base. given the lack of light i would really recommend not staying there. * mürren (murren means to grumble, not that anyone is going to care). you would think heaven crashed into shangri la from the way the internet goes on about this place. certainly it is in an impressive location. but you are limited to only a few local options without having to faff about with multiple cable-car and transport methods, great for a few nights but don’t go planning to spend a week there. **interlaken** the best thing about interlaken is it a convenient base and very good transport hub giving plenty of options of where to go: jungfrau region, brienz, kandersteg, bern and many other places are an hour or less away by train from interlaken ost. however the town itself is mostly pretty modern and forgettable. hotels and tourist shops are about all there is. there are nice views, but there are nicer views in much nicer places. * it has no real focus point or style, just feels like a slightly sprawling mess. it is between two lakes, but not on either, which takes away quite a bit of potential charm. queenstown in nz is the obvious place to compare it to in many ways, but queenstown is so much nicer. * the unterseen section near the west station is the nicest area with a tree lined quiet river and old buildings. sitting with my feet in the river on a hot summer evening looking up at jungfrau from there was rather nice. but otherwise i spent one evening there once and now just pass through. * it is very busy and the yha next to the ost station is often constantly booked out in busy season. i stayed in the alplodge hostel which was cheap and had a nice rooftop sitting area. though now i just go straight to the grindelwald yha if i am staying around there overnight. **luzern (lucerne)** one of the main spots and certainly worth a visit. always busy with tourists. the old town has nice parts, but is very given over to tourism and is not the best switzerland has to offer. it does occupy a stunning location and have lots of options for day trips though. * the walls at the back of the old town are impressive, quiet and free to climb up, especially from the tower closest to the river. the smaller wooden bridge further back from the lake is still the original, be sure to look up at the paintings as you go along. the iconic chapel bridge (which partly burnt down and was reconstructed) is generally quiet nice to walk across as the bridges on both sides and the lack of buskers mean that it isn't crowded. * the löwendenkmal (lion monument) is very powerful and surprisingly big. go in the evening or when you are sure it will be quiet, otherwise being surrounded by 4 tour groups will probably ruin it for you somewhat. * during the high-summer season accommodation will be heavily booked, so try and plan going there in advance. * get the train to flüelen and then spend the day riding the boat back along the whole length of the lake (3 hrs) hoping on and off as you like. the far end around flüelen in kanton uri is especially impressive, but most tourists just seem to stay in the gentler luzern end. * rigi and pilatus. both are mountains that stand aside from the alps and offer fantastic views and have multiple transport options to get up. pilatus is probably the more impressive of the two (and a bit less busy too). walking up from wegis to rigi is fairly easy and a very nice hike. **zermatt and the matterhorn** the matterhorn is truly one of the sights that no photo does justice to. no matter how many times you see photos of it, the first thing you say when you see it will be “well bugger me, that's right bloody massive that is!”. it continues to be hypnotically attractive every time you see it. zermatt is pleasant, has a nice atmosphere, and plenty of bars and life, but is not the most interesting place. it is not very authentic either for the most part: the first thing you come across is a mcdonalds. it is surprisingly big, and is mostly just modern chalets. the car-free aspect is nice, though the electric cars can be annoying. note that any electric-car you get into is going to be painfully expensive; so walk if possible. the whole place is expensive really. * take the train to gornergrat and walk up the viewing platform along the ridge (hohtälligrat) to the cable car station or beyond. stunning views, relatively easy going, and fairly quiet. * the edelweissweg going up the pretty trift gorge, along the meadow (you can drop down from here to zermatt), and then looping up and back down a side valley past zmutt is really good - offering almost constant impressive views of the matterhorn once you clear the gorge. **zürich** just not that interesting really. oddly common on people's itineraries; i guess it is the first swiss city that comes to mind and as it is famous people assume it must be good. it isn’t a terrible place, but it just isn’t a very special one either. time and money are precious when travelling in switzerland, and they are better spent elsewhere. * it has a nice enough old town by the lake, with views of the alps. but in the big picture of switzerland it really isn’t very special. if you have been to a moderately nice european city before then there is nothing much of interest here. the famous bahnhofstrasse looks just like any other high-end shopping street in the world (and it isn’t even like the buildings are anything special either). * it does have very good transport connections to most of the country and elsewhere. * it is lively at least. probably more life, night-life, and open shops here than anywhere else in the country. * not the capital city. neither is geneva. it is bern, though the federal government has so little power compared to the kantons that it doesn’t really mean much. **geneva** as above - just not that interesting really. not as nice as zürich either. just don’t bother is my advice. i am sure plenty of people love it, but for me it is just an airport. * geneva does not make the best first impression; you leave the station and have to fight your way through a number of busy and noisy street blocks before you even get to the lake or old town. a busy main road runs along the waterfront around the city centre too (as it does in zurich and luzern too, but it seems so much worse in geneva). * geneva is the only place i have seen in switzerland that really flaunts money with expensive cars everywhere and such like. the country might be wealthy but mostly it is fairly modest. * some nice museums at least. but it is one of the few places in the country that i honestly have felt no desire to go back to. * if i do go back i will check out the rhone-arve river junction which looks like it is worth a look. **the glacier express** 8 hours. 8 hours on a single train. * the route is certainly very pretty, i have covered all of it on normal trains in a number of different stages. you would be hard pressed to find a more consistently stunning route, but by god i do not intend to ever do it in a single day. * i have met people whose entire time in switzerland was spent on trains getting to, from and on the glacier express. that seems downright mental to me. * very few glaciers are actually visible from the route oddly enough. and you pass close, but out of sight, of some of the most amazing ones in the alps (aletsch and morteratsch). * hilariously the windows are shut tight, so (unlike on the standard regional trains) you can’t avoid window reflection in photos. **a few other famous things** **oeschinensee and kandersteg**: the lake really is as striking as it looks in photos. makes for a refreshing swim in summer. because the cliffs are so steep the hiking options are rather limited around it. sunlight is a bit limited too by the cliffs. it turns into a frozen skating ring in the winter with some ski runs nearby. kandersteg itself is a nice village with lots of options for things to do around it. **bern**: the federal capital. very handsome old town that is well worth a few hours to explore by itself. einstein lived here as a young man, but he most certainly did not become instantly inspired by seeing the clocktower as he went past on the bus one day. check out the bear pit in the summer. swimming in the aare is popular in the summer, but it is very fast and dangerous in part so be careful. a very nice atmosphere, but don’t expect lots of night-life. very good transport connections to most of the country so would make a good base. **montreux and château de chillon**: montreux occupies a very beautiful spot, though is not that interesting in itself. a short-train ride, or very nice 30 minute lakeside walk gets you to the château. the château is very impressive, offering quite a bit to see with at least some information on hand in most rooms and possibly also a temporary exhibition. apparently it is also the most visited spot in switzerland, i have been in feburary and had the snowy place to myself. **goldenpass route (montreux-zweisimmen)**: this actually is rather amazing and worth the hype, highly recommended any time of year. been in the various carriages and can’t say the special old-style one made much difference to me. as ever hop on and off and explore the villages and places rather than just seeing them pass by. **interlaken-luzern train**: a very popular route, the luzern end is pretty and the interlaken end very dramatic. doing the brienz-interlaken part by boat is highly recommended. getting off at brünig and walking along the 3hr flat(ish) path to reuti is a good way to take the landscape in properly. meiringen is worth a look for the slightly surreal sight of a town deep in switzerland that is obsessed with sherlock holmes. the reichenbach falls are the infamous spot of the “death” of sherlock holmes, but are not actually that impressive in reality. the aare-gorge is well worth a gander. **gruyères**: a very pretty little village famous for cheese and aliens. the giger museum and bar are well worth seeing, especially for the surreal juxtaposition compared to the village itself. it is in a bit of an awkward spot to get to via public transport from most major places, doable but slower and with more changes than you might expect. best done as a detour along the way rather than a there and back in one day trip. i went on a snowy day in february and it was very beautiful and quiet, though judging by the size of the car parking facilities it must be rammed in summer. **stein am rhein**: i was actually very charmed by this town. not much to it but very nice, especially along the waterfront. the riverside train ride from here to st. gallen is slow but lovely. **swiss national park**: a beautiful area indeed and easy to get into or near with public transport. it really gets sold on the wildlife, but i hardly saw any, less than i have sometimes on other hikes elsewhere in the country. by virtue of being famous and only having limited paths you will have more people around you than you would on paths in places outside of the national park. it feels a bit odd in some ways: it is trying to be wilderness but is so small that you can quickly wander out of it, or see outside of it easily - and it is in a country where the mix of nature and man is one of the best parts. still well worth a visit, but it doesn’t stand out as that special compared to the rest of the country. i rather like the val minger and munt la schera. **rheinfall and schaffhausen**: not overly impressed by the rheinfall. yes a whole load of water is constantly going over. it is surprisingly touristy, the number of boats going back and forth over the water seems almost comical. the tower you can go to is pretty tiny and they seem to put quite a few people on it at a time. also it has an industrial estate opposite the castle which kind of ruins it a bit. schaffhausen itself is a very nice little town, well worth an hour or two to poke around if you are in the area. though unless you are passing by anyway then there isn’t much point going there when you could go the alps instead. **liechtenstein**: “that isn’t switzerland!” i hear you cry. yes, it is another country and being a tiny one is what attracts people’s attention. though it is pretty well integrated into the swiss system (bar the fact it has a prince). it has an interesting history on paper, but in reality the country is pretty dull. unlike switzerland itself it looks like almost everything was built 20 years ago. there are a few impressive looking castles like vaduz and balzers, and the alpine bit is nice enough with the [princes way (fürstensteig) being rather good. but mostly it is a bit bland, and for the high price there are so many more interesting places nearby in switzerland (or cheaper in austria). if it was just another part of kanton st. gallen then hardly anybody would care about it. if you are passing by then stop in for the novelty of a tiny country, but don’t go out of your way for it. **onto more interesting things** **part 2. my top places (in no special order)** [basically see this * **valle verzasca, ticino**. the whole valley and the region around it is just amazingly pretty, it is far more rivendell than lauterbrunnen is to me. the stone rustico villages in this area of the country are especially charming. at the bottom is the contra dam of goldeneye fame, quite funny watching the film after knowing that what is meant to be frozen remote russia is a pretty valley scattered with villages that have palm trees in them. very impressive to look over the edge, though buses are not frequent so it is only worth the stop there with a car. bungy jumping can be arranged. buses go all the way up the valley. but can get full on weekends/holidays. * **the whole of ticino for that matter**. an utterly wonderful region, with fantastic valleys, mountains, and towns. being on the south of the alps it often has sun whilst the north has rain, and the sun lights up the mountains much better. totally overlooked by most travellers so it tends to be fairly quiet (other than the ever present swiss-germans). * **eggishorn and the aletsch glacier, valais**. the aletsch glacier is possibly the single most amazing sight in switzerland. eggishorn gives you a 360 degree view of the alps, and straight down onto the whole of the aletsch glacier. from there you can see the matterhorn, jungfraujoch, and mont blonc among other peaks. a cable car runs up from fiesch. i walked up from fiescheralp cos i am slightly mad, but got rewarded with lots of marmot encounters. then walked down the steep south slope, around the märjelensee and alongside the glacier down to bettmeralp. a long but fantastic walk. you can do shorter and easier walks (or just cable cars). * **saint-ursanne, jura**. a wonderfully charming old town in a rural and pretty (if not dramatic) area. it often appears on swiss tourism images, but because it is so far out of the way not many people get make it out there. * **lavaux vineyard terraces, vaud**. terraced vineyards overlooking lake geneva and the alps. a famous but not very busy area. i recommend going from lutry (with a detour from the station to the shorefront and back to see the village) to st saphorin so you constantly get the mountains as the backdrop. be warned it can be very hot - the paths are south facing, made of stone/cement, and are exposed to reflected sunlight from the lake. * **appenzell and the alpstein**. the whole region feels like the shire collided with tellytubby land. some parts like säntis, seealpsee and gasthaus aescher are quite well known. walking or even just taking public transport anywhere in the area is amazing. renowned for being very traditional, though this is not always a good thing (women couldn’t vote on local matters until the 1990s). * **basically anywhere in graubunden**. the whole kanton is fairly wild and utterly fantastic. not as high or dramatic as the western parts of the country for the most part, but still beautiful. the rumantsch culture and the painted stone house architecture is very unique and interesting. i have yet to see a part which i did not like (well maybe davos….). jumping on and off on the bernina line down to italy is really good, especially walking up to the morteratsch glacier. the area around flims is fairly unknown but rather stunning. just pick anywhere in the kanton and it will be good. st. moritz is not that nice as a town (unless you like expensive flash things), but makes a very good base to get to other places out of. * **bernina express, graubünden**. the whole thing feels like a model-train enthusiast drank too much coffee and got let loose in an engineering workshop. the route is far too good to rush through in a single session. i have spent a few long weekends hopping on and off. trains normally run once an hour so you can jump off and explore somewhere before jumping back on again later. * **centovalli railway, ticino/italy**. a rather unknown line connecting locarno to domodossola. not the most epic but still utterly beautiful mountain scenery. also the fastest way to get from ticino to valais. * **monte tamora, ticino**. not quite 2000m, but the highest peak in the area. providing 360 views of the whole of ticino, the alps, the forested and gentle prealps, the italian lakes, and down to italy. the cable car at rivera puts you an easy 1.5hr walk from the summit itself. there is even a mountain-coaster to keep you entertained. * **lötschental, valais**. a slightly out of the way valley. features everything swiss: little villages, snow capped mountains, a glacier, and cows with bells. it also has masks which are always on show somewhere. * **solothurn**. very pretty, and with almost no tourism it has a very authentic feeling old town. quite lively and full of restaurants given the small size. also has one giant cathedral. * **val de travers, neuchâtel**. one of the best bits in the jura mountains. the aruse gorge, the creux du van, and the upper valley itself are all easy to reach and beautiful to see. * **gasterntal, bern**. a wild valley with only a rough road and a few farmhouses, that ends high up at a glacier. very close to the famous spots of kandersteg and the oschinensee but almost unknown. even transport access is limited with only a rough road and fixed up/down times near the narrow entrance, a taxi-bus runs in the summer requiring booking ahead. the descent down from the gemmi pass is steep but breathtaking. * a summer only village collection of stone houses and even a church. 1.5 hours walk up a cliff from the nearest form of transport. i walked from the station at wasseraun, past seealpsee, up a cliff path to meglisalp, then onto santis (predicted time 5hrs). **part 3. other places** **jura mountains**: somewhat overlooked in favour of the more dramatic alps. on the southern edge the chain tends to jut up suddenly: providing steep hills, sheer cliffs and lots of gorges. this gives great views of the jura, the flatland and lakes, the alps, and also off into france and germany. further in there are long valleys filled with farms and villages, surrounded by dense tree covered mountains separating them. generally getting more gentle as you move north towards france. lots of quiet and beautiful spots to find. **canton jura**: completely neglected but quite nice. forested hills and gorges gently roll into france. for some reason the current lonely planet flat out says that travel here is only possible with your own car/bike/feet: which given the number of trains and buses that cross most areas is a bit of a surprise. * **murten and avenches**: two little towns 10km apart. murten is german speaking and has basically all the old defensive walls intact still. avenches is french speaking and is the site of a former roman town so has lots of ruins to see. as they are so close they are worth doing one after the other. **basel**: a really nice city with a mix of modern and old parts. lots of good museums and culture. on the far side of the jura it is right next to the black forest rather than the alps. so you won’t get the real swiss experience (except for the prices, and the chance to buy cow bells). there isn’t much to the airport, so if you fly out from there don’t go too early if you can help it. **st gallen**: beautiful old-town and a very nice social but relaxed atmosphere. the abbey is well worth a visit. the library is very beautiful, but the entry price is rather high given how small it is. makes a great base for appenzell too. **sion**: very lively town with [two iconic fortified well worth a stop on the way up valais. **part 5. a whole load of random points** * the yellow postbuses are the real unsung heros of switzerland. they will be waiting at the station as you get off the train to take you up to whatever little mountain villages the trains can’t make it to. they are cheap, friendly and often have a wonderful local feel (don’t be surprised if the driver waits a bit longer at one stop for a friend who is running late to get on). if you are driving on narrow roads then the postbus always gets priority. * fasnacht is quite a sight to see. though depending on your tolerance 30 minutes might be enough. it is very much a thing for groups of locals: so whilst it is interesting to see you can never really be a proper part. * everyone has (had?) to have access to a nuclear bunker. [many buildings have a giant door leading to one in the growing up in a country which would have been a major cold war target it is odd to see a neutral place was much better prepared. * the kanton bern bear varies between having a penis and not having a penis on the flags (the little red thing). one of you having read this is going to suddenly blurt out loud “oh look it has a penis!” one day. * the swiss are annoyingly used to the views from the trains. whilst every traveller has their face pressed to the train windows, the locals sometimes barely glance up from their spreadsheet or whatever else they are doing. * the swiss often get louder and more social the closer you are to the mountains, even city dwellers get louder and more outgoing closer to the peaks (i have gotten off mountain trains with a headache from the chatter of excited hikers). * apparently the swiss stare freaks anglo people out, i have never noticed it myself though. * you often see young guys in uniform on the weekend going to and from army service. sometimes with a rifle, though it will be unloaded and they have to go directly to and from the base with it. * you will often also see tank traps, bunkers, and defensive lines as you travel around the country. and shooting ranges are everywhere as periodic practice is mandatory during the army period. it feels like a more sane version of north korea in some ways. * you see the swiss flag everywhere, there is a national pride but it is very modest and nothing like the over the top usa-style. in some places you suspect they need the flags to help remind them they haven't wandered over the border. * whilst the views from swiss stations can be astounding. the stations themselves tend to rather bland and ugly. all the old pretty ones burnt down it seems. * an interesting cheese is the tête de moine (monk’s head) cheese made in canton jura, it is cut to thin ribbons using a special shaving device. also in supermarkets pre-cut. * my favourite type of cheese is mütschli, there are lots of varieties made all over the country. * fondue is meant as heavy winter food, and is best not consumed with gassy liquids. one on a coolish summers evening isn’t too bad, but having one for lunch with a large beer during august would be a bad idea. don’t forget the idea is to only touch your mouth to the food, not the fork which goes back into the communal pot. * lindt and toblerone are boring and on sale everywhere in the world. frey, cailler and ragusa are the real local choices. * [so ermm… * the swiss are not always good at naming things. the transport system around locarno is run by ferrovie autolinee regionali ticinesi, meaning the buses and trains have big signs on them saying fart. you can even take the fart train out of the bottom of switzerland. * on the first wednesday of february every year the civil defense alarms are tested. if you are in any kind of urban area it will sound like nuclear war to break out.",none,5

50% plus 1 of each of the state populations in each state as or less populous than minnesota means that 12.06% of the u.s. population would have needed to vote for whatever candidate won the senate elections in all of those states. in other words, this is the minimum proportion of the u.s. population that must have voted for the 60 senators representing those 30 states. just in case anybody

[citations omitted] georgia gives every qualified voter one vote in a statewide election; but in counting those votes she employs the county unit system which in end result weights the rural vote more heavily than the urban vote and weights some small rural counties heavier than other larger rural counties.

aa98ff9f-0435-4279-a203-e30a645e84ec,"so i met a cow-vigilante or ""gau-rakshak"", and i want to share my experience...","so this chhath puja i went to my aunt's house which is in a village in bihar. my aunt has always told me about the ""gau-rakshaks"" in her village and i really wanted to meet one, to understand how this whole cow-vigilante thing works and why is there so much violence involved with it. so i met one of the 9 members of this village's vigilante-group and the whole interaction was interesting, to say the least. i am not going to write a wall of text, so i am going to keep it short and concise. i enquired about many things, with my first question being about the violence against muslims. this man, who is in his early 30s, promptly told me that **some extremists (you know who they are) are using cow-vigilantism as a farce to attack muslims.** he didn't mention any group's name, but he was heavily implying *you know who*. he then went on to explain how his village was contacted by different people, the ""babus"" and the ""unche log"", to enquire about their ordeals while dealing with cow-smugglers and if they need some outside ""help"", but they have somehow managed to send them off. i then enquired about the cow-smugglers, to which he replied that this problem was actually very real, and impacts both the hindus as well as the muslims, as the muslims of his village also keep cattle for diary products and farming. he then explained that the police is utterly incompetent in his district, the complaints about the cow-smugglers fall on deaf ears and the police never does any strict operation against the smugglers. he also revealed that sometimes, the smugglers have those indian guns or ""kattas"" which makes the whole thing even more dangerous. hence, this and many other villages have to keep guards, or ""gau-rakshaks"" who patrol the village streets at night, and if a smuggler is caught, then after ""interrogating"" the culprit, they hand him over to the police (who lets the culprit run away by taking bribes, at least that's what the man told me). my conclusion from this whole interaction is : **india's law &amp; order system is already in shambles, and the extremists are trying to use this to spread communal disharmony.** the need of the hour is to reject such extremist groups, and some major police reforms, or else this problem is going to worsen with each passing day.",none,5

(her family is very irish, and i am basically as germanic/scandinavian as it gets.) i have a rough itinerary started from things i've read and comparing other peoples' past trips. but i want to take some opinions on how much time we should invest in any particular towns i mention (or dont mention!) and if my timetable seems reasonable. this is the first time i've ever had to plan anything like this (i'm only 23, we've only ever planned weekend trips to maine/nh/vt.) so it's a tad overwhelming. anyways! ireland-wise we know we have to see dublin and cork, and we want to see quaint little coastal towns and beautiful shopping streets of cobblestone. we're not really 'doer' people in the sense of going skydiving or kayaking down rivers. we just love seeing beautiful villages and towns and absorbing as much culture as we can eating everything in site and enjoying the rolling hills and coastal breeze. same idea for germany, which is why we know if we only have a week it has to be bavaria. ok, so- here's what i got. day 1+2- dublin/dalkey. (dame street, dublin castle, st patrick's green, grafton street/henry street. dalkey) day 3- wicklow mountains, enniskeny, glendalough, and kilkenny. (kilkenny castle, macdough junction) days 4+5- waterford, dunmore east, dungarvan and ardmore. (any towns we need to see around here? is 2 days too much time for just these places?) day 6- cork and kinsale day 7- kenmare, killarney, dingle. stay in dingle, kerry airport to munich in the morning. day 8+9 munich! day 10- dachau concentration camp for some history, maybe some other history hot spots anyone knows about, then the drive to ettal, where we will have one hotel for the remainder of the trip. day 11- fusse (neuschenwenstein castle) day 12- ettal abbey, oberammergau, garmisch partenkirchen day 13- linderhof castle, plansee, and karwendelbahn day 14- wake up, enjoy the beauitful drive to unterwössen, take in the last of the views of lakes and mountains, and the scenic ride back to munich. spend as long as we can in munich before having to take the plane back home to ct. i thought i'd pose this rough draft while i'm still trying to figure out all the logistics so you guys can point out any glaring problems like way too much on one day vs not nearly a day's worth of stuff on another, and most of all, let me know if you think this trip sounds like it'll be alot of fun! thanks reddit!",none,5

(early) real analysis? (early) algebra? beyond?), and what steps should be taken to prevent posts and comments from subverting these content goals. i'm going to propose rule changes i'd like to make here to begin a discussion, but please, please take a moment to comment in disagreement, agreement, or anything in between. moderation is both easier and more effective if i know what we collectively want from this subreddit! (proposed) rules: 1. allowed topics: this subreddit is for mathematical discussion at least at the level of undergraduate studies, excluding main sequence calculus. our goal on this subreddit is to focalize discussion around topics with less representation among online learning resources. discussion regarding academic culture, career questions, or current developments in math are also encouraged. please do not post questions with an explicitly calculational flavor. instead, direct them to r/learnmath or r/cheatatmathhomework. 2. no homework help: questions that are clearly looking for the answer to a homework problem will be removed. in an effort to curb posts that break rule 1 as well as low effort posts in general, please do not answer these posts except to direct them to r/learnmath or r/cheatatmathhomework. 3. inclusiveness: people of all kinds study mathematics. denigrating others for their perceived traits, including but not limited to: age, gender, race, sexuality, creed, or mathematical maturity, will not be tolerated and will result in a temporary muting and further mod action upon repeat offenses. please be welcoming and congenial to all. 4. self promotion: please use discretion when posting personally created youtube videos, apps, or other monetized media formats. the primary goal in posting such content should be to show an interesting idea that redditors will enjoy or learn from. content that does not show a good faith effort in this goal will be removed, with temporary mutings for repeated issues. edit: thank you all for sharing your thoughts and honest critiques. one theme is already apparent; these rules are far too harsh. looking at them with fresh eyes the next day, i completely agree. i'm gonna circle back with some less draconian mod responses. my goal is not to obliterate this sub with a ban hammer! edit2: considerably softened the disciplinary tone and made the intent of r1 and r4 clearer.",none,5

1d739d5f-2061-4ae3-b2ec-d54f0af7b5f1,the reason airfare prices are cheaper on one site or another,"i see so many questions about whether booking via a third party is legit and why prices are so much higher/lower on one site than another, and if you should always book direct because clearly the third parties are a scam. so, being that i work in this stupid industry, i thought i’d whip up a short faq about one of the reasons some websites can offer dirt-cheap airfare. first, let’s define some terms! **online travel agency (ota)** - an accredited seller of tickets. otas work directly within the gds to offer fares. they may also work directly with airlines to get exclusive pricing. they may also work with consolidators. (ah! consolidators! and that's what we'll be talking about today.) literally, an ota is an accredited travel agency, so they make commission on ticket sales just like a human travel agent would, at big volume. **examples**: priceline, expedia, travelocity, booking.com, ctrip. **gds** - global distribution system. a network that facilitates bookings between airlines’ reservations systems and travel agencies and otas, allowing agents to see and compare all available flights (or consumers to see all available flights via the ota's booking layer). airlines can opt in or out of a gds. **examples**: amadeus, sabre. (not that it matters, you’re never going to see a gds anyway. i’d show you mine, and you would be sad because it looks like **so … how is an airfare cheaper on an ota than with the airline?** first, know that most otas are grabbing their fares from the gds. those fares are essentially identical to the airline's own direct fares, aside from any booking fees the ota may apply themselves. so if you're booking a fare that the ota got from the gds? it's the same. the airline says, that's cool, i'll distribute my stock via a gds. the ota says, let's use a gds so we can get a butt-ton of ticket options for our users. et voila. but what if you're seeing a fare that's $50, $100, *$500* cheaper than on the airline's own website? a fare that's much cheaper than any other ota is offering? what the actual fuck? and then you go to reddit and you ask, is this fake? you're *probably* looking at a consolidator fare. **what's that?** let’s walk through a real-life example! hi, i’m a consolidator. let’s call me littlefinger. airlines really like me because i have good relationships with otas. i can move lots of stock. they know i know the industry and which otas are having an up year. i know how to market to a certain demographic or region. and of course the otas like me because i get that good shit from airlines. so let’s say air westeros comes to me and says they need to move 100 tickets to dorne during shoulder season because the shareholders are concerned about this year’s numbers and the board is anxious about flylannister, which keeps opening up in new markets and undercutting air westeros’ pricing. so air westeros says, littlefinger, if you move 100 or more tickets in q4, we’ll discount them $150 a pop. i turn around to my favorite ota, superhappycheapflights4u.com. we’ve been working together for a while. i say air westeros has these flights to dorne for $150 off. you want in? superhappycheapflights does. of course, there are some restrictions. these are weekday flights only, and you can’t sell them for below $600 apiece, and you can’t say they’re from littlefinger or superhappycheapflights. but you also can’t say they’re exclusive pricing, and you can't advertise them, and the airline won’t issue exchanges or refunds, so make sure passengers know. ok, says superhappycheapflights. load ‘em into my res management system. i’ll mark them down by $75 and pocket the other $75 as a commission. cool, i say. superhappycheapflights moves 600 tickets marketing cheap dorne flights to college students. i get a cut. air westeros is happy; their numbers look good. flylannister has a down quarter and has to slow its expansion plans, plus its ceo dies in the john. everyone is happy. except for the ceo. he is dead. **what to know about consolidator fares:** * yes, they really are that cheap. they can be anywhere between 10% and 70% off, depending on the airline's needs. the airline has done some complicated-ass math to determine its optimal yield. they know how much they can safely discount this stock. * yes, these fares are legit, provided you are booking on an accredited ota. you should have access to the fare rules and cancellation policies, and you should be given a confirmation code (pnr) at time of booking. if you don't get any of those, it may be a scam. * consolidator fares may be limited. airlines are concerned about cannibalizing their own sales; this is an industry with razor-thin margins, after all. so consolidator fares sold via an ota may not allow refunds, cancellations, seat selection, or cabin upgrade. you may not be able to service your fare with the airline itself; that is, if you need to talk to customer service, you can’t call air westeros to do it, you have to call your ota. this isn’t true for all tickets, of course, and some are treated like regular airline stock. again, read your fare rules. know your fare class. learn what a [fare basis code and impress all your friends. * you probably won’t know you’re booking one. **can you name some consolidators?** some of them, you'll never hear of. they move in the shadows, like soft-slippered eunuchs. but some sell public fares (cheaptickets or airfare.com). most, though, you'll find via a meta site or ota, and you won't ever hear the consolidator's name mentioned. so there you have it. next time you find a wicked cheap flight, you may be seeing a consolidator fare in the wild.",none,5

d0db8d54-cdec-4e39-b700-4cc5312d4c38,mega-thread: the kathua gang rape,"### background source: asifa went missing on 10th january. her family and neighbours searched for her and when they were unable to locate her, a police complaint was filed on 12th january. &gt;but, according to mr pujwala (father), the police were not helpful. one of the police officers, he alleges, said asifa must have ""eloped"" with a boy. it was only after the community protested that police officers were assigned to the case. &gt;one of those who was assigned, deepak khajuria, was himself arrested in connection with the crime. her body was discovered five days later. ### crime source: &gt;the eight-year-old was gangraped thrice inside the devasthan or prayer hall, after the mastermind had “performed rituals”. one of the rapists was called from meerut to “satisfy his lust”. the girl was confined using sedatives, then strangled and hit on the head twice with a stone — “in order to make sure” she was dead. but not before another accused, a police personnel, asked the others to “wait because he wanted to rape” her one last time. &gt;and all this, to “dislodge” a group of bakherwal muslim nomads from rasana village in kathua near jammu. ### protests #### hindu ekta manch source: &gt;on february 14, the hindu ekta manch held a protest march. &gt;speaking to the media after the rally, prem nath dogra, the bjp’s district president in kathua, alleged that attempts were afoot to crush the “voices of nationalists” and that bakarwals were “anti-nationals” who shouted pro-pakistan slogans. he questioned the investigation, calling it “jihad”, led by a “a specific bunch of people”. the investigation is being headed by a muslim officer from kashmir. dogra said the government could have formed a team “with 50% members of hindu community”. &gt;sharma (president hindu ekta manch) blamed “outsiders” for misleading the “simple and decent” bakarwals. his said his group also wanted justice for the murdered child and it was not “shielding anyone”. “we are asking for a cbi investigation so that everything becomes black and white,” he said, referring to the central bureau of investigation. &gt;in spite of sharma’s claim that they only want an impartial investigation, the hindu ekta manch seems to have shifted its attention from the enquiry to the gujjar-bakarwal community in general. on february 17, the group called for a social boycott of the community in hiranagar, asking hindus not to sell land to them, give them fodder or trade with them. the meeting where this decision was taken was reportedly attended by rashpaul verma, vice chairman of the other backward classes welfare board who enjoys the status of minister of state; kuldeep verma, the bjp legislator from hiranagar; and subhash gupta, kathua district president of the congress. #### lawyers source: they claim that they have four demands firstly, rohingya muslims must be thrown out of jammu. the second demand is to withdraw an order issued by the tribal affairs ministry of jammu and kashmir, which states that no action can be taken against tribals unless it is approved by the tribal minister. thirdly, bovine smuggling has increased. earlier, the police used to stop bovine vehicles, but now the j&amp;k government has issued an order that the police will not stop and check any bovine vehicles. by doing so, they are encouraging bovine smuggling. fourth, is the hiranagar incident (the kathua rape case) in which that girl must get justice, but the crime branch investigation is bringing in a communal divide and the facts are being ignored. we said we need the cbi to investigate the case and we fail to understand why the government is not doing it. now the matter has come to court. therefore, there was a jammu bandh. they also claim that the charge sheet is made up. &gt;can any man ever rape a girl in a temple or any religious place this is unreasonable and lies as no one can rape a girl in a temple. if he does so, he is not a hindu. this crime can never happen in a temple. this is an unnatural crime and we feel the crime branch has made up a story, which is concocted. i feel this story was made up by these officers from srinagar to project an image that muslims are not safe in jammu. --- ### megathread since the front page was dominated by the incident, we have decided to create a mega thread where we can consolidate discussion.",none,5

(i don't say this aloud.) 2. how about you stop being cunts to scientists and stop promoting fuckall cow logic to other people? there is so much pseudo science in this country, no scientist wants to stay back that's for sure. (no offense to isro people because luckily we don't doubt the existence of space at least.) 3. india, as a country gives away billions of rupees to temples and religious places. this is a very major problem. temples should fund scientific research as they get so much money whereas students like us have to beg for sponsorships (which nobody offers) to fund our research. 4. the government does not promote science at school level whatsoever and teaches students ramayana with flying monkeys lifting mountains for just one bloody plant.

fair warning, this is not something you can do overnight. it is also a long process that depends on a fair bit of luck and requires stomach for risk. be warned, emigration takes years of planning and years of work and integration before you are able to say ""i emigrated"". it is not easy and there are few shortcuts. #what benefits will you get -you will be on the path to western citizenship. i will not explain to you just how few benefits your indian passport gets you and what the price of your indian citizenship really is. *always remember that your indian citizenship shackles you to the indian bureaucracy. you can continue to be culturally indian while enjoying the benefits of western citizenship.* -your quality of life will improve. period. objectively, there is no scope for argument here unless you already have millions in the bank in which case you would not be reading this -you won't have to deal with the same set of problems that everyone (aka the salaried, income tax-paying middle class) cribs about in india but to which no one has yet found a solution. examples include ""what will people say"", noise and air pollution, the constant hazard of food-borne disease, questionable doctors and medical treatment and a whole host of other issues -your income will go up on a ppp level. -your tax money will not disappear into a black hole. roads will be driveable and you can hold public officials to account if things don't work -opening a business is transparent and there is accountability and plenty of options for support. opening a business in india, the less said the better. #what are the downsides this is subjective and varies for everyone. -you may find yourself socially isolated and without any friends -you may get homesick -your mental health may be affected -you may not find a job and may be forced to return to india saddled with debt which you will have to repay in inr -you might have to learn a new language. -on a purely numeric basis, your taxes and expenses for most items will go up -you may not like the culture and society of the country you moved to #of course, this depends i work in a non-it industry and india has very few employment opportunities for someone like me. there is zero (near as much matters) r&amp;d in my industry in india. salaries are are a joke. working hours are long. i just get a better deal abroad. this may not be the case for everyone. if, like so many here, you work in it, your opportunities may be almost the same in india and abroad. the quality of life aspect is something you cannot argue with but when the money is flowing, it becomes harder to make an argument for uprooting yourself. if you work in the medical field, you may need to study further or get licensed again. this takes time and effort. if you work in sectors such as law or the arts, i cannot comment about your employment opportunities. as a general rule, stem degrees go further than arts degrees. sorry, but that's just how the world works. #someone told me that the job market in germany is better than the netherlands. your comments? part of the process of emigration is doing your research and learning to ask the right questions. if you are asking someone to compare job prospects in two countries, the person answering either has to be an economist or has to have worked in the same industry in both countries. the number of people who meet this requirement is vanishingly small and anyone else attempting an answer is feigning knowledge. you might as well ask a dog (or an octopus) to pick between the two choices. #what are my options the traditional emigration destinations for the educated indian has been either the usa or one of the british commonwealth countries (the developed ones). these are good options primarily because the ""learning curve"" is less steep compared to other destinations. you already speak the language and this is a huge benefit. with the usa, it is a gamble and you might or might not be able to secure a green card. until that point, you are on and h1b visa and your options are limited. if your visa is not renewed, you are screwed and have to leave the country as your indian passport won't allow you the right to stay as a tourist. the educational opportunities in the usa are second to none but be aware of the pitfalls. i will leave it to others to fill in the information for the usa including the medical insurance system and school expenses for your kids. canada and australia offer a pr (permanent resident) program for skilled workers. canada: canada has a points system and you stand a good chance if you score somewhere in the 400+ range. this is the easy part. the hard part is finding a job. jobs for non-it folks can be hard to come by and your mileage may vary. do your research. for canada: &gt;there are plenty of jobs in the engineering field that do not require a p.e. license. for example, for a civil engineer, you can start at a lower grade that doesn't require you to sign off on blueprints and designs: you can work as a site supervisor, laboratory supervisor, civil technologist. you can work in these fields while gaining the requisite work experience under a licensed pe to get your own license. (via /u/chronus_ess) australia: if you have a degree from a recignised institute, you can get an 18 month, no strings attached, work visa. the australian skilled migration program is here in either of these cases, you have to sit the ielts and then provide recommendation letters from your past employers. if you are an engineer (non software / it) you need to be licensed in canada and australia *in order to find a job* the pr process does not require a license. (corrected by /u/chronus_ess). see canada and australia are good options if you do not work in it and have limited options in the usa. research the licensing requirements as this may throw a spanner in the works. make sure you have your documentation ready before you move there or, better still, get the process going before you move. the eu also offers a path to pr and citizenship provided you live in a certain country for a fixed duration, usually five continuous years, eight in others. keep in mind that you are not allowed mobility between countries in this time period i.e. you cannot claim to have lived in the eu for a total for five years and then apply for pr in a country. remember that the eu is not a nation and cannot issue travel documents. only eu member states can do this. living the eu has benefits and pitfalls. the benefits include arguably the best quality of life on the planet with government mandated annual leave quotas and year-long maternity leave, sometimes for both parents. the pitfalls inlcude the fact that the eu is a fractured continent and that there is no european identity. this leads to situations such as inter-national mobility figures being low for eu citizens themselves despite all the benefits promised by the eu single market and (edit) despite the fact that they are granted free movement on paper. there is the issue of language which is very important. european languages are limited in their utility and it often does not make sense investing in learning one. this is because of the limited geographic area in which they are used. barring examples like english, french, spanish and to an extent, german, learning any from the remaining eu languages is utterly pointless unless you have a liking for it or plan to live in a specific country. look into the eu blue card if you want to : the eu blue card, as it is now, is little more than yet another parallel visa system (in true european fashion) and adds little value. most of the promised benefits are not yet recognised by member states. you cannot yet apply for pr in an eu member state based on time spent in another member state. for example, if you work in germany on a blue card for four years and then move to spain to work, you will have to work and live in spain for five years before you are eligible to apply for pr. your time spent in germany does not count towards these five years. salaries in the eu are good to begin with but do not grow beyond a point and are unlikely to be competitive with what the usa offers. **general comment on the eu**: life in the eu can be great at the beginning with the culture, the architecture and the vibrancy of the place in general. don't get lost in this. the primary difference between the eu and north america is that most white people in the eu are from the eu. this is not the case in north america, despite what people may claim. there is more acceptance in north america than there ever will be in the eu. the us and canada are nations built on immigration. the eu is not. immigration is a new phenomenon in most countries there. no matter how hard you try, you will never be able to change the fact that you are not from the eu. many indians i've met in eu countries live like long-term tourists, never learning the language and never truly integrating. that gets tiring very quickly. as of today, most middle east countries do not offer (or offer limited) pr or citizenship options. working there is good if you want to make money as income is not taxed. your quality of life, though, might be great or it may not be great. it depends. the netherlands has a skilled migrant visa called the kennismigrant visa. there's also a 30% ruling that grants you 30% of your income tax-free. this makes a big difference to your in-hand income. you need a job offer to be able to apply for this. netherlands kennismigrant (knowledge migrant) visa: denmark's skilled visa program uk info: (see comments below &gt;no idea about the other categories but on a simple work visa known as a tier 2 visa, you are granted one for 3 years with an option to extend it by another 3 years. once you have stayed for 5 years and provided you satisfy some easy to fulfil conditions like not being away for more than x days in the last 12 months you can apply for ilr i.e. indefinite leave to remain where you can almost all rights as a citizen. after at least 12 months of this you can apply for citizenship #how do i go about doing this? broadly, you have two options. i assume that you are not rich enough to be able to afford investor visas. option 1: go abroad to study and then work your way from there. this requires stomach for risk and also some money in the bank. i would not recommend courses that charge fees, especially in the eu as there are too many barriers to overcome. i would not recommend going to the uk to study because of the visa situation. i quote one of my replies here: &gt;figure out what you want to study. which course. what is it called. try a google search for ""course name"" ""country"". &gt;for example: electrical power engineering finland. (this is what i studied) &gt;this throws up the following list: &gt;one of the options is &gt;that's a good list but i'd advise you to stick to the top 1-2 universities in smaller countries like finland. &gt;once you've found the course, look at the individual courses. i apologise for using the word ""course"" in two different ways here. at this point, start looking at the coursework. google the professors. read the titles of their publications. see what piques your interest. the situation in the usa might be different and taking on student debt there could make sense. i will not comment on the feasability of that here. i am not an expert and know very little. the same is true for studying in canada or australia. if you go abroad to study, make sure you have a plan b. there is no point going to sweden to do a phd in gender equality studies and then crying foul when no one gives you a job. never forget that you have lost the lottery of citizenship and to base your choices around that. your options are limited but make sure that you are aware of all of them before embarking on a course of study abroad. it is a once in a lifetime investment and chance so don't botch it ""chasing your dreams"" if those dreams won't get you a job once you're done. it is hard work and takes time but nothing in life is ever easy :) option 2: is to find a job while sitting outside your destination country. this is hard but not impossible if you have skills which are in demand. this is admittedly easier for people in the it industry but it is possible for others. the main hurdles you'll face here are visa issues. countries like the netherlands and germany make this process quite easy. inform your potential employers about the visa possibilities. use linkedin and your common sense here. there is only so much i can do to help with this. make sure to look up visa and pr issues in your destination country. in most cases, you need a job offer to be able to go down this route. examples: netherlands: germany: france: #conclusion there are two paths you can take. one is to stay in india, for whatever reason that may be, and crib about the situation, about how corruption ruins everything, how no one does anything to improve the country and a million other things. this path has several issues but you have to make your peace with your choice and deal with the fact that few things are within your control or power to fix. the other path is to work hard, emigrate and live in the west. this is not easy either and involves several sacrifices but the end result is in your control and is largely determined by your own efforts. end of the day, there is no right or wrong choice. objectively, life in the west is better and you get a better deal. subjectively, it depends. emigration involves years of hard work and starting your life from scratch in a foreign land in literally every aspect. one important tip is to embrace your new home and make it your own. keep your friends from back home but don't depend solely on them. you'll do just fine. remember to not shit on those who are forced to remain in india because of circumstance. it could have been you. about those who are too lazy to put in the work and simply deride your choices, remember that they are not paying your bills or improving your life in any way. ignore them. good luck!",none,5

(edit) thank you all for the great advice. i’ve spent the last week contemplating and often found myself thinking about the responses i received. i considered, as honestly as i could, the possibility that i was simply running away from my problems. i weighed up what i would be losing and what i may gain by following through with this plan. i tried to put myself in my shoes a year from now, having returned, “what will the hangover look like?” so this is where i stand, i am going to work for 3 months to tie up loose ends and complete certain obligations at work. if i didn’t do that some colleagues of mine would have some serious mopping up to do which is unfair. i am in talks with a different company, they are smaller, more mobile and have different challenges, but with great potential. they are not the giant corporate sweat shop i work for now, with regimented polices and megalomaniac vps who don’t give a shit about anything or anyone other than themselves. i have been honest with them and hopefully we can work something out so that i’ll have something to come back to. the point is i’m going, the plan is in motion and although not watertight by any means, i’m going to do it. if the other company falls through, it will be a setback and i’ll need to find something else but i don’t want to look back in 30 years and hate myself for having played it too safe. anyway, what’s south america like in may/june?",none,5

we were very surprise to learn how old they were. this is truly a unique site due to its location and age. i now lead a team of six scientists, four graduate students, one undergraduate, and other colleagues in researching the underwater ancient forest. i am seeking new collaborations and i want to bring in other experts to the project so we can learn as much as we can from this unique time capsule of an ice age landscape. our team has learned a lot about the site but we still have many more questions to answer. **about ben:** i first learned of the underwater forest from a dive shop owner in alabama. he discovered the forest about a year after hurricane ivan, when a fisherman came into the dive shop and said, “i’ve found this spot that’s just loaded with fish but there’s barely anything in terms of structure that shows up on my depth finder. why don’t you go out there and take a look.” the fisherman turned over the coordinates to his spot, and the dive shop owner made a trip and found the bottom littered with cypress stumps and logs scattered around. luckily, the dive shop guy decided to keep the location a secret. he did so because of his experience seeing small natural coral outcroppings destroyed by divers collecting live rock for the aquarium trade. knowing i was an environmental journalist, he decided to tell me about the forest. after a couple years of bugging him, he agreed to take me to the site on the condition that i never reveal the coordinates to anyone. he agreed to let me write a story. kristine called me the day the story came out, explained her expertise as a scuba diving paleoclimatologist, and asked if i could get her samples of the wood so she could have them carbon dated. when those first samples turned out to be radio-carbon dead, meaning too old to be dated that way, she asked if she could come with us to the site and collect more samples. you see her first visit to the forest in the film. she assembled a team of scientists including dendrochronologists, geologists and paleontologists. much of their research is revealed in the film and in several papers kristine has published. some of the most interesting finds are newly revealed, since filming was completed. in particular, the pollen assemblage seen in the sediment cores that lsu collected. the story [at this provides a sort of layman’s primer on everything i’ve gleaned about the forest from my earliest visits to kristine’s research. it also has a lot of pictures of the site and a link to the underwater forest film. a quick read might be useful to help formulate your questions.",none,5

b4bc72f2-7a43-41ff-aafb-9237ffbe97a2,[semi-urgent] my au pair family and i have decided it's not working out -- looking for advice on what to do now.,"here's my situation: i am a us citizen in spain, on mallorca in a town close to magaluf. i'm here without a visa since the planned stay was less than 90 days. i have been here for about a week and have a return flight already booked on sept 14 from barcalona (with a layover in stockholm). i have about 750 usd that i'm willing to spend. that leaves enough to get a last-minute flight back to the us and get a job and whatnot, should things not work out here. the way i see it, i have the following options: * go back home, go back to my old job (either before or after stretching that 750 as far as i want). i really, really don't want to do this. for one, i'm already in europe at this point and i'm hoping to make the most of it! * try to make the 750 last until my original return flight. i've seen some success stories here on /r/travel and i'm sure this is plausible, but i don't know if it's right for me. . . i like traveling in a different way than a lot of people. i like to find a new, unfamiliar spot and settle there for a month or more, rather than bounce around and do the touristy stuff all over. i just don't know what i would *do* with myself besides spend time thinking about how to spend as little money as possible. * get an illegal job. i asked the family about this and they said bars and clubs hire illegally, and i actually have experience working in bars back home, so this might be plausible. if i go this route it seems like it would be easiest to stay in mallorca, since i've seen lots of bars around here where the staff are all native english speakers. (i have no idea if this is normal elsewhere in europe.) * try to get legal, online work. maybe as a transcriptionist? i looked into this while i was still in the us because i was hoping to maybe continue around the world for a bit, and it seems like a solid option. major drawbacks are that i doubt i could get *quick* work this way (i could easily see companies waiting two weeks to a month to respond to an application) and that they all seem to require microsoft word, but as of now i only have a ubuntu os. (i can delve into the technical nonsense of how that came to be and why it's actually an issue if somebody wants to talk tech-ese, but i'll leave it out of the main post.) * ~~try to bartend in turkey. this is actually legal (turkey has pretty lax visa requirements), and i remember seeing a couple websites on this before i found my au pair family, but it seemed a little bit sketchy. it also bears the immediate cost of getting to turkey, and if things don't work out i'll have traveled over there with not much to show for it.~~ that was probably ridiculous. as of now my tentative plan is to kind of ride my way through the second, third, and fourth bullet points in order: spend as little money as possible while looking for illegal work, once i have illegal work and feel somewhat secure, start looking for legal work which will offer some piece of mind as well as more freedom to travel, since i'll be working online and not in a physical place. the family has agreed to buy a hotel for me for ""a few nights,"" so i at least have some time to figure things out. any and all advice and ideas on what to do next would be greatly appreciated! cheers!",none,5

b6e3aa71-6b73-4be3-bd8e-92e71b7a2d48,solid advice from biswa kalyan rath,"&gt; young people in my newsfeed. college students, school students. &gt; another suicide has taken place. another life is lost. i don't know any other way to motivate you than saying this. &gt; my cgpa in college was 6.83 out of 10 or less, i can't remember or find that grade sheet. i almost failed in many subjects. i don't know anything about biotechnology. &gt; i did not get placement in any company. to put that in perspective, iits have a near 100% placement rate. &gt; i wasn't good at anything then. i could play some shit on a guitar, or write a poem on some blog or click horrible photos with a dslr camera. complete lack of skill, completely unhirable. &gt; my first job was a sales job and i was fired after 3 months. monthly salary was 15k, which seems decent but all my friends were earning at least thrice the amount. &gt; i was also going through personal problems as well, which i don't want to get into but i was emotionally fucked as well. &gt; these things made me feel like a spectacular failure.i was depressed for a couple of years and i lost around 8 kgs. i was thin to begin with. thankfully i had friends to support me throughout. &gt; after a couple of years, as i kept doing what i believed i would be good at, things started getting better slowly and steadily. i was a horrible graphic designer, a horrible web designer, a horrible coder, a horrible writer and a bad comedian for quite some time. i have embarrassed myself enough and been bad at multiple fields. but with support from close friends, i kept working at it. &gt; suddenly one day, things changed for the better and people who i assumed thought of me as a failure started messaging me saying they were proud of me. people started appreciating my work. &gt; today, i don't feel like a failure despite whoever feels whichever way and i am happy with my life. and that's a big deal. &gt; not everybody has as good friends as i did. which is why i would like to tell you the following which i needed to hear then. &gt; moral of the story: &gt; 1. failure at education system/college/school doesn't mean failure at life, if there is such a thing. there is no correlation. our education system focuses on competition more than knowledge. it's outright bad. &gt; 2. if you work hard and do what you love, you will be happy. success is secondary and it will also happen. you will win solely because so few people dare to try. just work hard. &gt; 3. you have enough time to fail at multiple career options. every failure is an opportunity to learn. &gt; 4. don't be afraid of failure. embrace it as part of life. life is a series of failures, punctuated by brief periods of time where things seem to be fine. the amount of success people have in a year fits into a magazine. everything else that billions of people have done that year is considered failure. &gt; 5. nobody will believe in you for a few years. it's just how it is. please believe in yourself and work hard. &gt; 6. don't end your life. at least give it 30 more years. dekho, kya hota hai. maje lo duniya ke. life is fucking spectacular and there is so much to learn and do. life will change so much in the next few years you won't be able to recognise yourself. &gt; 7. don't be ashamed of asking for help. there is nothing wrong with depression. it is a very natural outcome of the kind of society we live in. hota hai. sabke saath hota hai. &gt; 8. if you notice somebody behaving odd, talk to them. be kind. stop judging others, stop judging yourself. &gt; 9. don't do drugs. just fucking don't. they will ruin your life. /** source: biswa kalyan rath's recent fb post **/",none,5

a5ee0966-cc4d-4afa-9ed0-c1dfc85181b0,let's get reddit inc. interested in opposing cispa.,"reddit inc. has obviously not been as gung-ho about stopping cispa as it was about sopa. no big deal. we understand that you are a corporation, and you have your own interests. however, i strongly suggest that reddit inc. takes a serious stance against cispa. if there isn't a movement by the corporation, then it will be done by the people. two ideas. 1. i propose removing reddit from our adblock exceptions list on may 1^st. this will continue until reddit inc. decides to join us in opposing cispa. 2. also beginning on may 1, there will be a boycott of purchasing reddit gold. thanks for the ideas, guys! 3. a week long boycott going through may 14 until may 21. seven days of redditors not using reddit. if they join us on or before may 14^th we will not need to do the boycott. if they join *any time* after may 14, then the boycott needs to continue as planned. it will not be very convincing if we just wuss out three days into a demonstration. so, what do you think? do you like the idea? will you actually do it? edit: changed the date to may 14 so that /r/fia will not endangered by the blackout. my bad. edit 2: is a link to a thread for the admins. give it some publicity, and hopefully we will hear from reddit personally. edit 3: along with adblocking, we should do a reddit gold boycott. no one purchases gold memberships until we see action. any positive reinforcement on this, and i'll add it to the list. **implemented** edit 4: is a link to some other great web activism. we don't have to stop at cispa. edit 5: okay, a lot of people are leaving messages about how we need to hit the politicians. i couldn't agree more, but i also accept the fact that this is less likely. if we could get some people to send letters, and make phone calls to their representatives it would be much more effective at mitigating future bills that negatively affect us. can someone write up an example/template so that we can send these letters en masse? edit 6: [awesome that gives some explanation of cispa vs. sopa. edit 7: making requests for the fbi to send you all the information they have on you? might be a good heads up to see some of the types of information that entities will be able to share with each other. a few thousand requests should be a pretty clear heads-up. to info about getting your fbi file. (better idea? let me know!) **serious** edit: alright, so there are a lot of people who will (not surprisingly) refuse to leave reddit for a week. since this seems to be so intolerable, i've gotten an interesting suggestion. for the days that we have our protest/boycott people should make accounts with something such as: anticispa_protest_xxx (where the x's are for a random number, so you can all make these accounts) no use of your normal username, just the protesting one. this will keep reddit informed about our dissatisfaction with their stance on cispa, and also allow people to take a bigger advantage of our tier-style boycott (no use for the serious boycott, only anticispa accounts for the people who still want to make an impact). can i get some feedback? an honest thank you to potato_in_my_anus for this **seriously** brilliant suggestion =) **to the administrators** i am making a request for *two* things: 1. if the admins 'absolutely cannot, under any circumstance' blackout the site then have them write an incredibly detailed blog post, much like they did about pipa/sopa, so that users can be informed, motivated, and encouraged to take action on their own. using the blog post to effectively spread the word across the entire site will show the users just how much of an impact cispa has on all american internet users. 2. have the admins explicitly state that while cispa does not really affect reddit inc all that much, it does dramatically eliminate many safeguards for user privacy and expectations of anonymity. have them explain that while they cannot black out the site that they are using their voice, as best they can, to explain to users that they need to advocate for themselves and how they can do it. thank you to swampysoccerfield for this great idea in communicating with the admins. i am not trying to make this an anti-reddit campaign. you allow us to communicate very effectively, and we thoroughly enjoy using your site. i know that we can come to an agreement. but, **please**, show us that you are listening. show us that you are trying to do *something* that can benefit (hopefully with some good, politically motivated action) everyone. **sunday edit:** again, thank you so much. you guys have been awesome. to the administrator's response. thank you for responding to us and starting to really help us out here. let's not think that this thing is over, it is only the beginning. is a link to the start of our movement. **monday edit:** no response from reddit inc. adblock is on. i hope to hear from some of you that you've started to protest alongside me. still looking for a better solution, but haven't been getting a lot of response. i was thinking that we could push the idea of using throwaway accounts with anticispa in the name closer to may 7. maybe if reddit sees some outcry, they'll actually want to take a stance before we abandon the site for a week. keep up the good fight. **final edit:** sorry about the delay. i've had a lot of things going on, so i wasn't able to log in late last night. this will be my last post/comment/anything on reddit until the 21st. i hope all of you were serious when you said you'd join me. for those of you who simply can *not* resist reddit, i ask that you kindly stop using your normal account. make one called cispa_protest_2220222 and post/comment/vote with that. you guys have been great. i'll see you all in a week.",none,5
4f6f2151-33ec-440d-8a6d-10d81c70c3f9,caught my gas cylinder delivery guy cheating on the gas delivery. found out he and his team make 1lac+ profit per month!,"so i am from delhi, the epitome of honesty so it may not be that surprising. from the last couple of months, my mom was complaining that the gas cylinder is getting finished unusually fast. so, i decided to get a weighing scale to measure the new cylinders that were being delivered to my house. when the next time the delivery guy came to deliver and asked for money after weighing the cylinder on his shitty spring balance \(which showed it to be on a completely full reading btw\) i asked him to wait and weigh it on my scale. at first the delivery guy was a bit hesitant and said ""it's all fine bhaiya we are delivering for a long time to your house and my scale already showed that it's full"" but i didn't trust him and proceeded to measure it on my scale and viola! a full 3.5kg missing from the reading! the delivery guy got uneasy as we both knew that he has been caught. he blurted out that his collegue may have messed up and passed on the wrong cylinder. i confronted him and instructed him to replace it with the full cylinder. he obliged. after his charades, i told him to not repeat this mistake again and note in his handbook that this house has got a weighing scale now and cut it off from the fraud list. from that point on we always got full cylinders. i also reported that guy from the details mentioned on the receipt. so, today something peculiar happened, a different delivery guy came to deliver a cylinder to our home. so, i repeated the same drill and again found that it was missing 3.5 kgs, so when i told him to get me a replacement and asked for the checked the receipt to look for his name so i could report him, but i found out that this cylinder was not actually ours but our neighbours' and this guy got the address wrong. so my assumption from the last time that these guys run some kid of nexus in which they keep note of the vigilant houses with weighing scale and he non vigilant ones so that they can carefully scam the customers and not get caught repeatedly. the households where they do get caught, they apologise and say that their colleague must have made some mistake and this is a one time error and won't be repeated again and then they don't scam that house anymore. so, i did some calculations to find out how much these delivery guys are making by scam people on the daily basis\- price of one gas cylinder which contains 14.2kg of gas= rs. 742 price of 3.5kg gas \(profit per cylinder\)= rs. 183 let's assume conservatively that they are able to scam 20 people per day for a whole month, the total monthly profit gained= 183\*20\*30= about **rs 1.1 lacs.** this is good money and ample motivation to fuck up other people to ruin their nexus. so next time any of you get a gas cylinder, measure it, and if any discrepancy is found, just tell him firmly to not repeat this again and complain to your gas agency and don't fight with him. it's so fucked up that the moment you step out of your house to the moment you step in, my fellow countrymen are trying to scam me at every step and i have constantly watch my back in order to not be robbed of my money. it's a sad reality of living in india.",none,5

90a63c11-6efa-4913-a3c7-cbcfd25adff8,is instagram worth it? who do we travel for?,"this will be a long post so i want to preface what i am about to write so you know whether to jump in or not— i’m giving up instagram &amp; social media &amp; will no longer be sharing memories from my trips in any means other than personal conversations. the purpose of posting this is because i am looking for input on whether anyone has gone through this struggle before &amp; what their advice might be. i’ll start with some brief backstory of my relationship with instagram and how it changed over time, before discussing the lies i was telling myself about my intentions, why i’m giving it up, and why i think a social media-less life will be a happier one. as an avid traveler and backpacker of the last five years, instagram has always been a large part of my travel regimen. i was 19 when i took off on my first big trip abroad, and i was amazed by the gain in popularity my account received when i started posting pictures from my travels. it feels good to feel popular. i started to count likes, and pay more attention to followers. most impactful, however, is that i started to pick up on what kind of pictures performed well on instagram. i learned that pictures with me in them did much better than landscape shots. pictures of me &amp; my girlfriend were even more popular. but, if i could find a way to get me &amp; my girlfriend &amp; a scenic landscape in the background, that was the real magic sauce. of course, i didn’t really realize this at the time. i didn’t realize how my thoughts surrounding the platform were changing. and, honestly, there’s nothing wrong with thinking about instagram in this way. in many ways, it’s what comes naturally to my brain. i’m constantly in the habit of trying to optimize my life and i’m sure i’m not alone in that. instagram started to become just another thing to optimize, how do i get more followers, get more likes, etc. for me, travel was just the trigger that opened my eyes to caring about optimizing it. before i was traveling, i thought people that cared about instagram &amp; social media were stupid. but, something about finding my passion in travel that then correlated with an uptick in popularity all of a sudden made me start caring. as i’ve traveled more, and also matured, i’ve started to realize how instagram was actually taking away from my trips instead of adding to them. i was starting to look forward to trips by visualizing what places would be good to take pictures. when i would get to a location i always wanted to go, instead of taking a deep breath and being in the moment, i was worried about getting the shot. while i may have told myself that i didn’t care that much about social media &amp; instagram, my actions relayed a different truth. once i accepted the fact that a portion of my time spent in regards to traveling; from picking the destinations, when i went, what i did at locations of interest, was influenced by trying to get good pictures for instagram, then i had to accept the reality that i did care about instagram. so why did i care? my justification to myself was often along the lines of wanting to document my life. i would tell myself that a. the pictures were pretty dang cool, b. i want to look back on these memories someday to remember the trip, and c. my family &amp; friends want to know what i’m up to. but, the more i started to be honest with myself, the more i started to wonder if there were ulterior motives hidden under the surface. was i trying to impress people? was i trying to make my friends back home jealous? did i just want to prove to people that my life was awesome? after all, i don’t need to post pictures to be able to look back on the memories, the only additional component sharing it on instagram adds is that i’ll be remembering the social approval i received from that memory, quantified by likes. my family &amp; friends have been watching me travel non-stop for 5 years, and they care about me &amp; my life, but not as much about the pictures from the trips. calling my mom &amp; talking to her about riding the hot air balloons in cappadocia means a lot more to her &amp; to our relationship than her seeing a carefully curated photo of me on instagram. i realized instead of liking my friends pictures, and them liking my pictures, and having a relative understanding of where we are in life and what we are doing but not really talking, i’d rather call them once a month and actually continue our relationship by catching up. i realized that it was a lie that instagram and social media, in general, was keeping me well-connected with my friends &amp; family. the key here is well-connected. sure, we were connected. we see each others posts, but there is no intimacy in the social media exchange and all relationships are dependent on intimacy to survive. i would rather have a small circle of trustworthy people let into my life than a large swath of well-wishing acquaintances. lastly, and this was the hardest to accept, but i realized that a part of me just wanted to show off. why sugarcoat it? i was saying “look at me, i’m a digital nomad living my dream, bet you wish you had my life.” that’s an ego i want to avoid, and a mindset that can only lead to misery. this got longer than i intended when i initially started— so i apologize. i wanted to share this here on reddit to see if anyone else in the travel community has also struggled with using instagram and what solutions you have come to? my solution was to cut everything out, but i know that might not be for everyone. i am genuinely interested in your thoughts &amp; opinions, this is something that has been on my mind a lot lately and i’d love to hear what you think.",none,5

beyond breast cancer and male breast cancer coalition, joined today by scott m weissman, ms, cgc, of the national society of genetic counselors. we recognize the unique issues faced by men diagnosed with breast cancer. we will answer your questions about breast cancer in men, including: * what it’s like to be diagnosed with what is usually considered a “woman’s disease” * the role of genetics and family risk * ways to get emotional support and resources that help you cope with diagnosis and treatment **living beyond breast cancer:** for over 25 years living beyond breast cancer (lbbc) has been helping women and men who have been diagnosed with breast cancer and the people who love them. we work with leading experts in the medical and wellness fields to provide trusted and easy-to-understand

not discriminate and we want everyone to know “men have breasts too.” learn more about our advocates and experts answering your questions: **lori m. berlin:** i volunteer with the male breast cancer coalition because i lost a male cousin to triple negative metastatic breast cancer, and he saved my life. if it was not for bernard, who was negative for a brca mutation, my genetic counselor would not have run any tests on me. i am brca2 positive, and because of a previous high risk lcis diagnosis, i opted for a prophylactic bilateral mastectomy and oophorectomy. good thing, because the pathology indicated i was going to get breast cancer in both breasts. now i raise awareness of breast cancer in men every single day. **josh fernandez:** i am living beyond breast cancer’s digital media specialist, playing a primary role in coordinating and growing the organization’s online presence informed by the organization’s marketing strategy, employing web analytics, social media

coordinating publication reprints, photo shoots and our ask-the-expert program in support of the mission, programs and services of lbbc. i also write medical, psychosocial and promotional articles and

and a cancer genetics expert. as founder of chicago genetic consultants, llc (chicagogenetics.com), i bring the science of genetics and genetic testing directly to people who desire genetic counseling. i have more than 15 years of experience, and understand all aspects of the genetic counseling and testing journey. i can discuss everything from the decision to seek advice, the pros and cons of genetic testing, how genetic information can impact an individual and their family, and issues related to insurance coverage, privacy and discrimination concerns. i can also discuss hereditary cancer syndromes and how to educate family members about the potential risk of disease. **carl “mac” holmes jr.:** i spent my career in aviation, first serving for 27 years in the united states air force as an enlisted jet mechanic and crew chief and then as a commissioned officer and air force pilot. i flew t37, t38, c-130 and c-141 aircraft and served as chief of training, chief of plans, instructor/evaluator and command pilot before becoming squadron commander of the 155 air lift squadron. i retired from the u.s. air force in 2001 as a lt. colonel. my second career as aircraft captain for federal express began while i was serving in the u.s. air force reserves. in my capacity with federal express, i served as an instructor, evaluator and line check airman for the company and was an faa designee before my diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer. i faced early stage breast cancer in 2012 and prostate cancer in 2013. after successfully completing treatments i returned to work. during a regular checkup my physician discovered my breast cancer had returned. now facing the realities of living with metastatic breast cancer i decided to take on a new mission. i now work closely with the male breast cancer coalition to raise awareness of male breast cancer, metastatic disease and the need for additional research funding. i am a graduate from living beyond breast cancer’s “hear my voice” program and have been selected by the u.s. department of defense as a peer grant reviewer for the breast cancer research program, a program that supports innovative, high-impact breast cancer research. i also serve on the met up advisory council and represents disparities in metastatic breast cancer. **bill harris:** i was diagnosed with early-stage (ductal carcinoma in situ, or stage 0) estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer in june 2012. five weeks after noticing the blood spot on my t-shirt, my surgeon performed a modified radical right mastectomy, including lymph nodes and the nipple. i learned that i had tested positive for a brca2 mutation, which led my family to seek genetic testing. i am very thankful for the support i received from my friends and family, especially my wife and son. i know the challenges faced by men with breast cancer, and as a brother of the male breast cancer coalition, i'm thrilled to offer support and insight to help other men diagnosed with this disease.",none,5

'you don't seem like a muslim why have you ordered beef'. i hung up and contacted customer care and a new delivery agent was assigned, who finally delivered my order after a duration of 1.5 hours. now, i have a couple of sensible arguments against this 1) beef served in karnataka is buffalo meat and not cow meat. truly a tragedy, not even remotely as tasty as the real deal. 2) i have academically studied ancient hinduism in university and have conclusive evidence that we both consumed and performed ritual sacrifice of cow. 3) why tf did you sign up for this job, or even accept my order? however, i didn't bother explaining logic to this chutiya as i know that his belief system doesn't work on logic. what really grinds my gears is that we in the south have a pretty tolerant of culture. hindus and muslims live side by side, lead their own merry lives and often don't poke their noses into each other's affair. god forbid, i'm not going to be lectured in my own homeland by some hateful bigot in gutkha-impaired speech. edit - he outright refused service and he also 'canceled' the order on his end. as a contractor i believe he can cancel orders that he's accepted. swiggy can't do anything about it except assign a new delivery agent or offer refund.",none,5

e3df7c6a-94c9-45f7-8378-5aaa8d2039a6,[please advice] reality punched me in the face today.,"sorry reddit, this post is going to be long. please bear with me. also using a throwaway account for privacy concerns. this morning i woke up to the sounds of an argument between the landlord and my father. the landlord was asking us not to use one specific bathroom because it was leaking. the landlord is a pretty chill uncle, so i was surprised to hear him shouting.the argument was pretty one-sided though. so, i wake up and do my daily duties and that's when my mom comes to me to have a real talk. she says that we haven't paid the rent for about 8 months now and she figures that the landlord might ask us to vacate the place. she says your father hasn't been able to provide any income and shakingly admits that she's been asking relatives and people she knows money, to make ends meet. she says that my education was supported by taking loans from relatives and that we're deep in debt, about 10 lakhs. a little background about my family: we're a family of three, my father moved to this city in 1995 because of his job (reputed company) and so did my mother after getting married. things were going pretty good until 2005 when the company announced that they had to merge two branches and the branch in our city will be closed off. they were asking my father to transfer to another city, but keeping my education in mind my parents decided it's best for us to stay here, so my father resigned. my mother, a teacher, was also the earning member. at this point in the story, my father is about 40 years old and my mother is around 33 years old and i'm 7 years old. my father lands a job in a different company, it's a different job than what he's used to, he doesn't like it. a few years later, the company is forced to close due to losses and my father was laid off. my father was unemployed for about a year and my mother became the primary earning member. she teaches yoga as a home tutor. my mother handled things for a few years. fast forward a few years, my father joins my uncle's company, a completely different job this time, and moves to a different city. it has been this way for about 7 years now, things were starting to get back on track, but my father left the job saying the bosses there suck and he can't lick their boots for a petty job. i was aware of this and i was in 4th year of my engineering at this time and i graduated a year later with a job in my hand. the job requires me to stay away from my home city and has a 1 year training period, after which i'll be considered an employee of the company. cut to the question: i was brought up without any of these circumstances affecting me, i never knew about all of this until today and that too only because the landlord came to have an argument and i happened to be awake at that time. i really adore my mother and father, imagining how hard my mother worked to get me educated brings tears to my eyes. my mother cannot have a proper talk with father about his employment because she's afraid he might break down mentally. my dad is already very depressed (but he pretends he isn't) and also on the brink of his retirement age.i have a job now, and i'll be on the company payrolls as an employee from september. i don't want my mother to struggle anymore, what can i do, as soon as possible to get rid of all these debts and how can i have some real talk with my father about this situation and how to handle it.",none,5

4e1f1c73-51a5-4098-9f1c-2ea035815bba,a guide to dagestan,"[see my previous guide to traveling in chechnya **edit:** just added two short videos in my post/comment **all bolded links link to photos** while i lived in russia, i had the opportunity to visit dagestan, one of the most infamous areas in russia, three times. the first time was in november of 2014, then january 2015 for new year's eve, and july 2015 during ramadan. i traveled solely using public transportation on marshrutkas, or hitchhiking through the mountains. is probably the most mysterious, yet most maligned region of russia. it is infamous for its history of [islamic and reputation for extreme corruption, but it should be rightfully known for its extreme cultural diversity (13 official languages other than russian among 3 million people, with no clear majority language), delicious cuisine, and some of the best mountain views and oldest historical sights anywhere in russia. while the major cities are located on the shore of the caspian sea, the highlights of dagestan were easily its villages high in the mountains. as typical in the north caucasus, it's never just that simple. why? **tourism** tourism, in short, is not well developed. most tourists that you will meet will either be locals or adventurous tourists from other parts of russia. i don’t remember seeing english signs anywhere, even at derbent, which is a unesco site. as a western tourist in dagestan, you are likely to be alone everywhere, except in derbent. **safety** how safe is dagestan really? if you ask a random russian, they would tell you that it is simply too dangerous to go there, but in reality, it depends on where you go. in my experience, as a male traveler, you are likely to be safe if you keep a few things in mind. although some places in dagestan have faced recent terrorist attacks, they have so far only targeted government and police officials. russian police regularly publish the locations of counter-terrorist operations throughout dagestan, with the most recent ones in the tabarasan, khivsky, and suleyman-stalsky districts in the south, as well as the village of andi (dec 24, 2016). when i first traveled to dagestan’s mountain villages, i had to pass through a district with an ongoing counter-terrorist operation (untsukulsky district), but the most that i had to do was show my passport to a policeman at a checkpoint and explain what i was doing in that part of dagestan. **corruption** dagestan in western-authored travel guides is described as one of the most corrupt regions of russia. however, i never once got into a situation in dagestan where i felt pressured into paying an official any money. there is only one situation where one may feel intimidated as a tourist: passport checkpoints. when entering dagestan from chechnya via road, it is guaranteed that you will have to show your passport to soldiers at the border. when at bus stations in the capital makhachkala, any interaction with police will be preceded by a request to see your passport and visa. if you travel into the mountains via public transport near areas with counter-terrorist operations, police will single out foreigners for passport checks. despite going through all these scenarios, most police were quite friendly with me, and seemed more concerned about finding islamic extremists. **safety for women/minorities** in dagestan, follow light islamic standards of dress. women won’t need to wear a hijab except in religious places, but showing lots of skin is frowned upon. for african people – they’re a novelty, but left alone in makhachkala, as there are some african students in the city. for east asian people – there is a small population of illegal vietnamese workers in the villages and cities, so you may face some questioning from police of your legal status in russia. **language** in dagestan, russian is the lingua franca. while dagestan has a ridiculous number of languages (14 official languages total), but just about everyone in cities and villages will be able to communicate with you in russian. many people in the villages will have strong accents in russian, but learning some words in russian will be much easier than learning some of the native languages of dagestan. as you can see from [this linguistic map of dagestan]( where you are in dagestan will determine the main language, but major cities like makhachkala, derbent, and kaspiysk are ethnically mixed and mainly speak russian. the most common non-russian languages will be avar, dargin, and kumyk in that order. if you know some turkic language, you might be able to communicate with kumyk and azerbaijani speakers, but other languages in dagestan aren’t related to any languages outside the caucasus. english is virtually nonexistent, even in the capital makhachkala. i met a few local english teachers there who confirmed to me the same thing - very few people are serious about learning it. **itinerary** i only have experience entering dagestan via land. the chechen/dagestani border has a checkpoint that looks for suspicious individuals. if you wanted a more hassle-free experience, the borders with stavropol krai had no checks when i was there, although this may or may not have changed now. central/southern dagestan are where the best sights are located, and the main road stays on the coast. the best-known of these cities is: derbent is the oldest city in russia (5000 years according to the locals) and has strong influence from persian empires. it’s the only unesco cultural site in southern russia, being most famous for its old city and the enormous naryn-kala citadel that looms over the city. it’s also the third-largest city in dagestan, so for most tourists, derbent would be one of the first places they visit. personally, i would say derbent should be visited by anyone in the republic of dagestan. it’s got the most tourist infrastructure out of all dagestani cities, and a whole lot to see. you can probably spend two full days just to try to see everything, although the city itself isn’t very large. [more pictures of derbent]( when i first arrived in makhachkala, it looked like a complete dump. the city suffers from traffic jams, aesthetically unpleasing suburbs and soviet-style apartments. most guides recommend not spending too much time in makhachkala, and i would tend to agree, with a few exceptions. the center of the city around the parliament and university have places where one can peacefully stroll, and the coast allows you to be on the coast of the caspian sea. the [makhachkala central market]( is the largest open-air market i’ve seen anywhere in russia. other than that – try the lamb shawarmas at the northern bus station. **dagestani villages** [the distance between igali and makhachkala]( i traveled to the village of igali with a host using public transport. everyone in the village is an ethnic avar, speaking mainly in the avar language. almost everyone there knows each other, and there is absolutely no tourist infrastructure in the village (until my host finishes building his new guesthouse!). during ramadan, i hitchhiked into western dagestan from chechnya and saw three more villages. [my route from andi to rakhata]( from andi, i waited until i found a car going in the direction of botlikh, then my host from rakhata picked me up from there. these three villages are classified as avar villages, but only rakhata speaks standard avar – the village of andi speaks the [andi language]( and the village of botlikh speaks the [botlikh language]( **andi** - [**video of me on road from andi back to while i didn’t feel in danger in andi, there was a shootout between police and militants in the village on january 24. a pair of policemen described the village simply as a ‘shithole’ with ‘fuck-all to do’. still, it had great views. **botlikh** - [**short video of botlikh during botlikh is the largest settlement in western dagestan. i even noticed a hotel in the village, but i never checked it out. it’s better described as a town than a village, so there are many policemen around who would ask you what a western tourist is doing there if you were to have a stroll. **rakhata** rakhata, despite its small size (3155 people), is famous for a number of things in dagestan. it is well-known for its high-quality [burkas]( (a sheepskin caucasian coat worn by men, whether muslim or christian, not women), apricots, and its capture in the [invasion of dagestan]( by the chechen mujahideen.

[operation pull ryan](/r/operationpullryan) out appears to be off to [a great and is a good target (as will be evidenced here), but [there have been wondering if we should also target someone from the democrats as well. after all, we seem to be disgusted with congress as a whole, not just the republicans. so perhaps for that, or other reasons, i have compiled a mega-list on the voting records of vulnerable seats in congress. to explain how i deduced which seats were ""vulnerable,"" i used the cook partisan voting index, or pvi. pvi, per wikipedia definition, ""is a measurement of how strongly an american congressional district or state leans toward one political party compared to the nation as a whole."" ""the index for each congressional district is derived by averaging its results from the prior two presidential elections and comparing them to national results. the index indicates which party's candidate was more successful in that district, as well as the number of percentage points by which its results exceeded the national average. the index is formatted as a letter followed by a plus sign and then a number; in a district whose cpvi score is r+2, a generic republican presidential candidates would be expected to receive 2 percentage points more votes than the national average. likewise, a cpvi score of d+3 shows that a generic democratic candidate would be expected to receive 3 percentage points more votes than the national average."" in a nutshell, the higher a pvi score is, the more likely that district is to vote for that political party in the upcoming elections. generally, any score greater than or equal to 5 (d+5, r+5) is considered a ""safe"" seat. for this reason, the mega-list below only contains pvi scores 4 and lower (with the exception of some incumbents who are at a significant pvi-disadvantage). with that in mind, all ""vulnerable"" candidates have their voting history on controversial legislation listed here. enough talk; this list is long enough as is: **key**: * **d+#** or **r+#** indicates a pvi lead by # percentage points over the national average * **x** indicates a ""yea"" vote * **a blank space** indicates a ""nay"" vote * **np** indicates the politician was not yet a member of congress * **nv** indicates the politician did

9b33fc32-4e8f-4e26-aee3-059f2908c558,megathread: nasa’s curiosity rover has found new evidence preserved in rocks on mars that suggests the planet could have supported ancient life,"copying directly from the [press in two just-published papers in the journal *science* nasa’s curiosity rover has found new evidence preserved in rocks on mars that suggests the planet could have supported ancient life, as well as new evidence in the martian atmosphere that relates to the search for current life on the red planet. while not necessarily evidence of life itself, these findings are a good sign for future missions exploring the planet’s surface and subsurface. the new findings – “tough” organic molecules in three-billion-year-old sedimentary rocks near the surface, as well as seasonal variations in the levels of methane in the atmosphere – appear in the june 8 edition of the journal science. organic molecules contain carbon and hydrogen, and also may include oxygen, nitrogen and other elements. while commonly associated with life, organic molecules also can be created by non-biological processes and are not necessarily indicators of life. “with these new findings, mars is telling us to stay the course and keep searching for evidence of life,” said thomas zurbuchen, associate administrator for the science mission directorate at nasa headquarters, in washington. “i’m confident that our ongoing and planned missions will unlock even more breathtaking discoveries on the red planet.” “curiosity has not determined the source of the organic molecules,” said jen eigenbrode of nasa’s goddard space flight center in greenbelt, maryland, who is lead author of one of the two new science papers. “whether it holds a record of ancient life, was food for life, or has existed in the absence of life, organic matter in martian materials holds chemical clues to planetary conditions and processes.” although the surface of mars is inhospitable today, there is clear evidence that in the distant past, the martian climate allowed liquid water – an essential ingredient for life as we know it – to pool at the surface. data from curiosity reveal that billions of years ago, a water lake inside gale crater held all the ingredients necessary for life, including chemical building blocks and energy sources. “the martian surface is exposed to radiation from space. both radiation and harsh chemicals break down organic matter,” said eigenbrode. “finding ancient organic molecules in the top five centimeters of rock that was deposited when mars may have been habitable, bodes well for us to learn the story of organic molecules on mars with future missions that will drill deeper.” **seasonal methane releases** in the second paper, scientists describe the discovery of seasonal variations in methane in the martian atmosphere over the course of nearly three mars years, which is almost six earth years. this variation was detected by curiosity’s sample analysis at mars (sam) instrument suite. water-rock chemistry might have generated the methane, but scientists cannot rule out the possibility of biological origins. methane previously had been detected in mars' atmosphere in large, unpredictable plumes. this new result shows that low levels of methane within gale crater repeatedly peak in warm, summer months and drop in the winter every year. ""this is the first time we've seen something repeatable in the methane story, so it offers us a handle in understanding it,"" said chris webster of nasa’s jet propulsion laboratory (jpl) in pasadena, california, lead author of the second paper. ""this is all possible because of curiosity's longevity. the long duration has allowed us to see the patterns in this seasonal 'breathing.'"" **finding organic molecules** to identify organic material in the martian soil, curiosity drilled into sedimentary rocks known as mudstone from four areas in gale crater. this mudstone gradually formed billions of years ago from silt that accumulated at the bottom of the ancient lake. the rock samples were analyzed by sam, which uses an oven to heat the samples (in excess of 900 degrees fahrenheit, or 500 degrees celsius) to release organic molecules from the powdered rock. sam measured small organic molecules that came off the mudstone sample – fragments of larger organic molecules that don’t vaporize easily. some of these fragments contain sulfur, which could have helped preserve them in the same way sulfur is used to make car tires more durable, according to eigenbrode. the results also indicate organic carbon concentrations on the order of 10 parts per million or more. this is close to the amount observed in martian meteorites and about 100 times greater than prior detections of organic carbon on mars’ surface. some of the molecules identified include thiophenes, benzene, toluene, and small carbon chains, such as propane or butene. in 2013, sam detected some organic molecules containing chlorine in rocks at the deepest point in the crater. this new discovery builds on the inventory of molecules detected in the ancient lake sediments on mars and helps explains why they were preserved. finding methane in the atmosphere and ancient carbon preserved on the surface gives scientists confidence that nasa's mars 2020 rover and esa’s (european space agency's) exomars rover will find even more organics, both on the surface and in the shallow subsurface. these results also inform scientists’ decisions as they work to find answers to questions concerning the possibility of life on mars. “are there signs of life on mars?” said michael meyer, lead scientist for nasa's mars exploration program, at nasa headquarters. “we don’t know, but these results tell us we are on the right track.”",none,5

(xxxtentacion later repaired the phone.) later that day, xxxtentacion left the room and returned with two grilling implements—a “barbecue pitchfork” and a “barbecue cleaner,” she said—and told her to pick between them, because he was going to put one of them in her vagina. she chose the fork. he told her to undress. he was lightly dragging the tool against her inner thigh when she passed out. he did not penetrate her with it. &gt; ""pinpoint the days he threatened to kill you,” the reported victim responded, “well, when we lived in orlando, it was literally like every day.” &gt; ""and he was asking me why i was singing his friend’s part of the song, if i like him, why do i like him, like do i ever look at his twitter,” then, xxxtentacion head-butted her, punched her, stomped on her, and put her in the bathtub, where he continued hitting and kicking her. “he also wanted to cut out my tongue because i was singing the song,” she said. she tried to run away down the street. he tackled her, causing her head to hit the pavement. she suffered black eyes, a lump on the back of her head, scratch marks, and bruises, including a large bruise on her ankle where he stomped her. &gt; also while living in orlando, he hit her with white plastic clothes hangers. “he broke a good 30 hangers on my legs,” she said. around this time, he tried cutting her hair, and he held her head under running water in the bathtub. &gt; in august (2016), xxxtentacion was arrested in a separate case. (as previously reported, he was charged with armed home invasion, robbery, and aggravated battery with a firearm, stemming from an alleged incident in november 2015. &gt; he told her he knew she had cheated on him. he put a knife to her neck, strangled her “a little bit,” and called her a “ho,” she said. that night, he woke her up and told her to go outside, where he picked up an empty glass beer bottle and demanded that she tell him the truth or, “i’m going to fuck you up.” she replied that she already was telling him the truth, that she had cheated and was sorry. he dropped the bottle, slapped her, and let her go back to bed. &gt; in two incidents there (streetwater, fl), xxxtentacion grabbed her by the neck, strangled her, and forced her down on the bed before another person who lived there came to the rescue. &gt; after finding out she was pregnant (which she claims was planned by both of them), xxxtentacion called the man she slept with while he was in jail. he then started elbowing, head-butting, and punching her. he strangled her until she almost passed out. he took her to the bathroom and demanded one last time that she tell him everything or he would kill her in the bathtub. she couldn’t even recognize her face in the mirror—it looked “distorted”—and her left eye was completely shut and “leaking blood.” she was losing vision. she vomited. &gt; after she requested to go to the hospital, xxxtentacion told her she couldn’t leave until her face had healed, because otherwise the police would be called. they left her in a bedroom, and xxxtentacion confiscated her phone. she didn’t get it back until he was arrested on october 8. &gt; for the next two days she didn’t leave that room except to use an adjacent bathroom. she couldn’t find a way to flee. there were bars on the windows. “if you’re smart, you would stay with me until you get a car and you have enough money to move into an apartment,” he told her. “because if you leave now, you’re just setting yourself up for failure. you’re going to be homeless.” &gt; she let him know she was going into the kitchen to make him some food. she opened the refrigerator door wide enough so that he wouldn’t be able to see her if he she crouched down, and then she opened a side door and ran to the nearest main street she knew. she didn’t have any money. she asked someone if she could use their phone and called the only number she knew by heart. it was the number for the ex-boyfriend she had been living with the night she agreed to move in with xxxtentacion. **tl;dr:** as someone from r/hiphopheads said, if this is true, this is chris brown x 100. --- edit: u/icantquitreddit0 put together a of things x has done before",none,5

[full basically here's the outline of the interview: **new album timeline** * mjk prefers releasing albums in spring or fall. * mjk says that before he embarks on other projects (new apc/puscifier albums) he checks in with danny, adam and justin to see if they're enough to giving him finalized products to write for. if he feels like he has the time to fit another project in before they give him their music, he'll take on a different project. * apc just signed a new record contract to do one record. with some light research, it looks like the likely release date is spring 2018. if tool were releasing their new album this fall, we'd have heard about it by now. mjk won't release a tool album at the same time as an apc album, so fall 2018 looks like the absolute earliest we'd see a new tool album (my speculation). more likely at least spring 2019 depending on how much apc tours after their new album. **tool's creation process** * danny, adam, and justin create the music. then they microanalyze every little detail, go back and make changes, some minor, some significant. * mjk doesn't even attempt to write lyrics until they give him a date to record. in the past he's tried to write along with them, but the music can change so much that he has to scrap his entire piece of the work because it no longer fits their music. * mjk heavily implies that he's still waiting for the rest of the band to give him their part of the music... i inferred that he seems confident that he'll have enough time to do the apc project before he can start writing/recording his piece. definitely worth listening to; it's definitely cool to hear him actually speak about the process, and i think it's good to see him a little impatient just because we're used to him treating tool fans like shit. i don't really see a reason for him to suddenly be open for once if they were close to release. i think he gave us the insight as a warning that it's going to be a while before we see the finished product.",none,5

ca784878-68a5-4dfd-95c9-06e975153688,why don't my elected representatives listen? i'll tell you why.,"i work in the senate, so this is a throwaway account to protect my identity and job. the shortest answer is this: the vast majority of people who contact their elected representatives are raging idiots. i've been to townhall meetings where people shout at the senator, rant and rave about this and that. i've answered constituent mail... 90% of it is garbage. form letters, petitions is half of it... another load is ranting from crazy people. calling us communists, ranting about the president, totally uninformed whacko garbage. it's gotten worse with email... most emails are just all caps, no punctuation rants. and then there's always the conspiracy stuff... fbi is reading my mind, etc. that said- there are many well written and informed constituent letters. and they all get read and get a response. but when one person writes about an issue, it's a drop in the bucket of crazy. things still get done though, there have been cases where constituents brought to the attention of us things we didn't know, and we made policy decisions based on that. organization and numbers helps. form letters are ignored, i recycle them immediately. but take the sopa/pipa debate. thousands of informed people wrote about their concerns. the letters were well written, polite, informative, and short. there were so many we're still answering them. so it can make a difference, but form letters and crazy ranting make it hard to stand out. i choose to believe the smart people are too busy/disinterested to write. the other option is to accept that most americans are crazy uninformed lunatics. and yes, we do listen to lobbyists and advocacy groups. why? it's not because they meet with us in a dark room and promise us money. it's because lobbyists are also policy experts who know their shit. yes, i did pay attention when the nurses lobbying group came in. why? because they showed me studies from the new england journal of medicine supporting their position, they highlighted a specific piece of legislation, and they showed me where it has worked in the past. they made a compelling case. the average citizen can't seem to form a correct sentence. i'm sure this will be buried, but that's the truth nobody can ever admit on capitol hill. and it's an unpleasant truth, but it's the truth. it falls on you, the citizen, to change it. edit: a word edit2: this has gotten an insane amount of attention and my girlfriend just arrived to visit me, so i'm not going to post any more. but: keep writing! if more sane, reasonable people write, the process starts to work, despite what you think. edit3: i'm not saying the citizens are idiots. i'm saying most people who contact us seem like idiots. i truly believe most people in america are smart, interested folks. they're just choosing not to participate. so participate! drown out the crazy/morons by writing in! i'm not saying the citizenry is stupid. i'm saying the part we hear from is stupid. we need intelligent folks to speak up. edit4: i want to make one point about the purpose of constituent letters. you don't write your congressman to change his mind. that's what voting is for. you write in to point his attention to an issue you feel is ignored. i'l use pipa/sopa as an example. most sen/reps probably didn't know much or even know about the legislation. but when they got a load of letters drawing their attention to it, they stopped it. on the other hand if you write in and say ""raise taxes on the rich"", well it isn't going to have a lot of impact. every politician has a staked out position on this issue, no amount of compelling argument is going to change somebody's mind, no matter how right you think you are. edit5: i thought this was obvious, but i'm not a senator.",none,5

(i did, however manage to get some pictures with her!) after visiting the shrine, she asked me if i had eaten lunch. i knew exactly where this was going. i said no and she asked me what i wanted to eat. i replied, ""ramen,"" as it seemed like a safe choice. she told me her favorite ramen place was around the corner. we walked there and she ordered for me, as i had difficulty communicating with the host. as i pull out my wallet, missa immediately tells me to put it away and she pays for my ramen and a beer. i was stunned! i had only known this woman for 2 hours. at this point we sit down and begin to eat. she tells me she is divorced because her ex husband fell in love with another woman and she had two children a bit older than me. after lunch she tells me we need to go to the 100 yen store. this is the equivalent to a 99 cent store in america. as we arrive, i figure this would be a good place to grab a souvenir for me mom, since it was her birthday right when we got back (sure call me cheap, but i am a broke college kid). i decide a traditional looking tea cup would be an excellent gift. i pay for it myself, surprisingly, and we leave. as we are leaving, missa says to me ""you know, if your mom likes tea, i have a gift for her."" missa then goes on to ask which hotel we are staying at and our room number. for some reason, i obliged and i told her. now i want to make something clear: growing up my mom was extremely strict about the, ""don't talk to strangers rule"" so this was pretty unusual for me. anyway, missa and i had spent around 4 hours together and we eventually parted ways. i gave her a hug and we exchanged email addresses. the next day, my dad and i had a tour at mt. fuji. however, when we arrived back at our hotel, i told me dad about the story and we raced down to the front desk. low and behold, there was a gift under my name. i opened it up and was amazed. missa had given me 6 traditional japanese teacups and a beautiful japanese teapot. she even hand wrote my mom a note. i've learned the moral of the story is maybe a little naivety can go a long way. my mom loved her birthday present and i will forever have a reminder of missa and her kind hospitality. tokyo gopro video:",none,5

849606b0-9d66-4118-83e4-1a0b91ef6d90,"i recently returned from a four month solo backpacking trip to central america. here are the things i'm glad i packed, the things i wish i'd packed and the things i wish i hadn't packed.","this list is specific to myself and my trip, but i hope it will help someone else when you're deciding what to pack and what to leave behind. it's not a list of *everything* i took, just the things i have specific comments about. **items i'm glad i packed** * **backup credit card** - i took my debit card and credit card and kept them separate in case anything happened. as it turned out, i didn't *physically* lose either one, but someone stole my debit card number and made fraudulent charges. i had to have the card blocked and use my credit card for the rest of the trip. without my credit card to use as backup (and a pin for cash advances) the situation would have been *far* more stressful. * **ciprofloxacin and rehydration salts** - if you spend significant time in central america, it's practically inevitable that you'll get diarrhea at some point, and with the heat and humidity, you can get dehydrated really fast. i won’t go into detail, but i was very grateful to have these with me when i needed them. * **pepto bismol, ibuprofen, anti-itch cream, alcohol wipes, neosporin, band-aids** - i used all of these and, again, was glad to have them on hand when i needed them. * **sleep mask and earplugs** - if you value sleep, you will probably want these at some point, especially if you stay in dorms. * **headlamp** - essential for staying in the jungle, in small towns without street lights, for when you stay in a dorm and go to bed later than other people, and for reading at night when your room has no reading lamp. * **travel towel** - a lot of hostels don't provide towels so it's best to have your own. i had one of those microfiber ones and even though it doesn't feel as nice as a normal towel, it packs small, dries fast and does the job. make sure to let it dry completely before stuffing it in your bag and remember to wash it occasionally. * **regular size lock** - a tiny luggage lock wouldn't fit on the lockers at a lot of hostels. * **reusable water bottle** - almost all hostels have water for refilling your bottle. central america has a huge garbage problem; don't add to it by buying bottled water every day. (also it saves you money and prevents other people from mistakenly taking your water.) * **umbrella** - most backpackers i met brought a rain jacket or plastic poncho, but in the heat, those can get pretty sweaty and uncomfortable. i found it much nicer to just use an umbrella. the one i travel with folds up very small. * **condoms** - when i was packing, i threw two condoms in my bag thinking “i’m sure i won’t need these, but you never know.” and, well, i needed them. :) you can buy them at any pharmacy of course, but it’s nice to be prepared. (pro tip: keep them somewhere accessible. spending 15 minutes digging through your bag to find condoms kind of ruins the moment.) * **postcards from home** - i took spanish lessons and stayed with host families and i wrote my teachers and hosts thank you notes on postcards from my state. obviously not essential, but nice if you’re staying with hosts. * **packing cubes** - made packing, unpacking and finding stuff sooo much easier. * **[icebreaker wool - they're super comfortable, wicking, naturally antimicrobial, and quick drying. i went for long hikes in hot humid weather and these kept me feeling much fresher than cotton undies. i took two pairs and washed one each day when i showered. * **a good sturdy, comfortable, wireless bra in black** - obviously bra preferences are highly subjective, but take something that fits you well, that you won't mind wearing for long periods of time, that's not so flimsy it'll get all stretched out and that won't get discolored when you sweat in it. was perfect for me. * **hiking pants** - some lightweight, quick dry pants were essential to me for jungle hikes, cooler days, nights with lots of mosquitos and times when i wanted to look more conservative. i took and * **hiking boots** - these were my bulkiest item and were a hassle at first because they didn't fit in my bag. i would wear them on the bus each time i went to my next destination, but that got old quickly. i tried tying them to the outside of my bag, but i wasn't convinced they were secure. finally, i just got rid of other stuff so i could fit them inside my bag. from then on, i was grateful to have them. i did lots of hiking on different terrains and having the right shoes for the job was absolutely worth it. * **flip flops** - essential for some hostels' showers. * **dropbox account** - not a physical thing, but i upgraded the space on my dropbox account and backed up all my photos every few days. fortunately, i didn't end up needing it, but it gave me peace of mind. i met several people along the way who’d lost all their pictures and i’m glad i avoided that heartache. **items i wish i'd packed** * **benadryl** - when i was putting together my first aid kit, i thought ""i never have allergies."" but guess what? you can totally have an allergic reaction to something you've never been exposed to before. lesson learned. * **shorts** - i read multiple times that central america is conservative and that women shouldn't wear shorts, so i just took one pair for the beach. that might have been true at one time, but just about everywhere i went i saw local women and travelers wearing shorts. i ended up buying two more pairs. * **sports bra** - i didn't take one because i'm small busted and don't really need the support. but hiking in that humidity made me sweat more than i ever have before and having a wicking sports bra would have been more comfortable. * **amphibious shoes** - i talked myself out of buying a pair especially for this trip because i was already spending so much money, but for the number of times i wished i had them, it would have been money well spent. * **go pro** - i'm not sure i would have bought one just for this trip, but between climbing into caves behind waterfalls, surfing, volcano boarding, canopy tours, rappeling, etc. it would have been fun. **items i wish i hadn't packed** * too many clothes - i ended up donating a bunch of stuff * jeans - i only took one pair and it was one pair too many * makeup - used only for the first week of the trip and then abandoned * sun hat - useful, but not enough to justify the amount of space it took up * sleeping bag liner - i’d read this would be useful for sleeping in hammocks outside, which i never ended up doing. * [refillable toiletry - i love these for shorter trips, but on a trip this long it was dumb because when i ran out of stuff i still had the empty tube to carry around. **other miscellaneous tips** * my 46 liter backpack was big enough for everything i needed. * if you buy items especially for your trip, try to buy them far enough in advance that you can try them out and return or exchange them if you need to. * since you won’t be packing many clothes, make sure you like the things you bring. if they don’t fit right or if they’re frumpy “travel clothes” that don’t fit your style, you’ll probably regret bringing them. * pack as few toiletry products as you can manage (ladies especially). i’ll admit that this one was tough for me. at home i have lots of lotions, oils, etc. that all have different purposes, but i was determined to pare it down to the absolute essentials for this trip. not only was it less weight for me to carry, but i actually learned to be lower maintenance. when i came home, i was kind of shocked to see how many products i own and i wondered why i thought i needed them all. * don’t be afraid of underpacking. remember that anything you need can be bought in central america too. used clothes are cheap and abundant. * finally, be aware that everything you bring could potentially be lost or damaged. don’t pack anything that you would be absolutely heartbroken to lose. my personal losses were: stolen ipod, stolen phone charger, cracked screen on my tablet, multiple clothing items lost or damaged in laundry, and two pieces of jewelry that fell off somewhere (i didn’t take anything expensive, just cheap things that i liked). among travelers i met, i heard countless stories of lost/stolen/damaged phones and cameras. flip flops are a commonly stolen item as well if you leave them next to the water when you go swimming.",none,5

(crl.) no. 199/2013 filed by pucl seeking the hon’ble supreme court to provide directions to ensure prosecution under 66a does not persist ([read here for ### what happened in court? we are happy to let you know in yesterday's hearing on february 15, 2019 prayers in this application were largely granted by the supreme court. the case was listed in court room 6 as item 52 before the bench of hon’ble justices mr. rohinton nariman and sanjay kishan kaul. pucl was represented by its team of lawyers lead by mr. sanjay parikh, supported by advocates ramesh pukhrambam; sanjana srikumar; apar gupta and abhinav sekhri and the union of india by the attorney general, k.k. venugopal and many other lawyers who assisted him. this came after the ld. attorney general supported pucl's plea for the need for greater awareness and sensitisation of courts, prosecutors offices and police. prior to the hearing in a counter-affidavit the union of india detailed steps it had taken to generate awareness on section 66a. this included a letter it wrote on 11.01.2019 and then a reminder on 14.01.2019 to various state governments asking them to furnish data on section 66a cases and also asking them to close them. some responded. for instance kerala stated that there were 19 cases that were filed after section 66a was held to be unconstitutional and they would be closing all of them. we expect greater compliance as the hon'ble supreme court due to further directions that were issued by it (we will link the order when it is uploaded on the sc website). this included sending a copy of the shreya singhal judgement to all courts, prosecutors and police departments in india. as we indicated in our study that while ideally section 66a should be removed by an amendment act of parliament, this is a promising outcome and will be a major check on fresh section 66a firs. we are grateful for this outcome which has come through in a non-adversarial manner. reach out to us if you become aware of any continued prosecution under section 66a. at the same time we promise to remain vigilant, collaborate with other organisations to ensure public victories on fundamental rights. after all legal zombies such as section 66a have this uncanny tendency to rise from the grave. # iff's role in the proceedings iff has not only supported research that provides a studied basis to reliefs sought in court but through its executive director appeared in the case and assisted pucl in management and work execution. as indicated before iff will continue to engage with courts for public outcomes on digital rights. we will collaborate, support and work with other organisations, groups and collectives. we continue to urge people to [**support by signing on and becoming its members and making donations to them. ## document links * sekhri, abhinav and gupta, apar, section 66a and other legal zombies (october 31, 2018). iff working paper no. 2/2018. . available at ssrn: or * please also refer to our previous blogposts, [**announcing the and then an [**update on a in the text of the information technology act. * [**web of 3220/2018 for ease of readability.

37c5995c-790e-486e-a9a7-f34f3ffa14a7,/r/science discussion series: why subjective experience isn’t always subjective science,"the /r/science discussion series is a series of posts by the moderators of /r/science to explain commonly confused and misunderstood topics in science. this particular post was written by myself and /u/fsmpastafarian. please feel free to ask questions below. --- a cornerstone of scientific study is the ability to accurately define and measure that which we study. some quintessential examples of this are measuring bacterial colonies in petri dishes, or the growth of plants in centimeters. however, when dealing with humans, this concept of measurement poses several unique challenges. an excellent illustration of this is human emotion. if you tell me that your feeling of sadness is a 7/10, how do i know that it’s the same as my 7/10? how do we know that my feeling of sadness is even the same as your feeling of sadness? does it matter? are you going to be honest when you say that your sadness is a 7? perhaps you’re worried about how i’ll see you. maybe you don’t realize how sad you are right now. so if we can’t put sadness in a petri dish, how can we say anything scientifically meaningful about what it means to be sad? **subjective experience is worthy of study** to start, it’s worth pointing out that overcoming this innate messiness is a worthwhile endeavor. if we put sadness in the “too hard” basket, we can’t diagnose, study, understand, or treat depression. moreover, if we ignore subjective experience, we lose the ability to talk about most of what it means to be human. yet we know that, on average, people who experience sadness describe it in similar ways. they become sad as a response to similar things and the feeling tends to go away over time. so while we may never find a “sadness neurochemical” or “sadness part of the brain”, the empirically consistent structure of sadness is still measurable. in psychology we call this sort of measure a **construct**. a construct simply means anything you have to measure indirectly. you can’t count happiness in a petri dish so any measure of it will have a level of abstraction and is therefore termed a construct. of course, constructs aren’t exclusive to psychology. you can’t put a taxonomy of a species in a petri dish, physically measuring a black hole can be tricky, and the concept of illness is entirely a construct. **how do we study constructs?** to start, the key to any good construct is an operationalized definition. for the rest of this piece we will use depression as our example. clinically, we operationalize depression as a series of symptoms and experiences, including depressed mood, lack of interest in previously enjoyed activities, change in appetite, physically moving slower (“psychomotor slowing”), and thoughts of suicide and death. importantly, and true to the idea of a consistent construct, this list wasn’t developed on a whim. empirical evidence has shown that this particular group of symptoms shows a relatively consistent structure in terms of prognosis and treatment. as you can see from this list, there are several different methods we could use to measure depression. self-report of symptoms like mood and changes in appetite are one method. third party observations (e.g., from family or other loved ones) of symptoms like psychomotor slowing are another method. we can also measure behaviors, such as time spent in bed, frequency of crying spells, frequency of psychiatric hospital admissions, or suicide attempts. each of these measurements are different ways of tapping into the core of the construct of depression. **creating objective measures** another key element of studying constructs is creating objective measures. depression itself may be reliant in part on subjective criteria, but for us to study it empirically we need objective definitions. using the criteria above, there have been several attempts to create questionnaires to objectively define who is and isn’t depressed. in creating an objective measure, there are a few things to look for. the first is construct validity. that is, does the measure actually test what it says it’s testing? there’s no use having a depression questionnaire that is asking about eating disorders. the second criteria we use to find a good measure is convergent validity. convergent validity means that the measure relates to other measures that we know are related. for example, we would expect a depression scale to positively correlate with an anxiety scale and negatively correlate with a subjective well-being scale. finally, a good measure has a high level of test-retest reliability. that is, if you’re depressed and take a depression questionnaire one day, your score should be similar (barring large life changes) a week later. **that all still sounds really messy** unfortunately, humans just *are* messy. it would be really convenient if there were some objective and easy way to measure depression but an imperfect measure is better than no measure. this is why you tend to get smaller effect sizes (the strength of a relationship or difference between two or more measured things) and more error (the statistical sense of the word - unmeasured variance) in studies that involve humans. importantly, that’s true for virtually anything you study in humans including all sorts of things we see as more reliable like medicine or neuroscience (see meyer et al., 2001). **putting it all together (aka the tl;dr)** what becomes clear from our depression example is just how complex developing and using constructs can be. however, this complexity doesn’t make the concept less worthy of study, nor less scientific. it can be messy but all sciences have their built in messiness, this is just psychology’s. while constructs such as depression may not be as objective as bacterial growth in a petri dish or the height or a plant, we use a range of techniques to ensure that they are as objective as possible but no study, measure, technique or theory in any field of science is ever perfect. but the process of science isn’t about perfection, it’s about defining and measuring as objectively as possible to allow us to better understand important aspects of the world, including the subjective experience of humans.",none,5

ba3f1406-45de-4365-9277-53af7fe28756,how our education system failed us,"back in 2009, prepping for icse class 10. everyone told me, 90% is the benchmark. i was told, it was the biggest exam of my life. too immature back then, i studied hard, never saw the light of the sun and ignored all, studied as much as i could do. and then i appeared for the exam, and passed with some 92.xxx(almost 95 if best of 5 etc was done). what changed? nothing. as the results were declared, it was like, ""meh, class 10 is nothing. your talent is actually tested in iitjee"". medical was never my cup of tea. yet i was forced to take biology by my parents. beta, you can appear for medical too they said.study hard. very hard. you must succeed. told my peers. yeah, and i did study. back in those days, we used to have regional mathematics olympiads. that was the gateway to inmo and next imo. my school didn't want to give me a pass to appear in the rmo exam, and it was after a lot of firefighting that i was able to appear for the exam, all on my own self. school used to send nominated candidates those days, 6 of them. when the results came on 26th december, 2010, my heart sank. in spite of a pretty good exam, my name wasnt there in the list. i cried. it was my first acquaintance with failure. i never knew the surprise that was awaiting me. that evening, i got a call from isi calcutta, yeah i had been selected. how i failed to see my name in that list, i still dunno. but that small and short experience of failure was going to come pretty handy. i was always good in maths. but boy, you are just a piece of shit if you aren't a btech. i failed in iitjee. and yeah, i saw the faces change. teachers poured scorn on me (lets accept it, i am not the coolest of guys to be with. a cocksure cully kind of a guy. so, yeah, mostly lonely and having a rebel kind of attitude. but these were the same men, who praised me only 3 months back when i was the lone guy cracking rmo.), those who cracked jee, after as if they were super intelligent. a guy with whom i had been best friends with, made it through. but after that, he seldom kept contact. they acted as if they were busy, but i could see through their thinly veiled vanity. i made it to one of the better nits. but i could realize something. that for all that we learn, it fails to teach us certain basic aspects of life. if not, then why are we so lonely? if not, then why are people, running haywire, to meet their insatiable aspirations? aspirations? my foot. when was the last time i did something i truly wanted? never. there was my answer. when i tried surfacing these doubts to my parents, they laughed at it, with scorn, contempt and a bit of vain sympathy. i could feel that. they told me, that's how life is meant to be. yeah, true maybe. more marks. more cgpa. more money. but it never told us, that our prime responsibility was only one thing. to question the status quo. to ask why is it that am so empty inside? why the fuck are things so bloody wrong? during my college days, i thought it would change. but it was all so the same. the more i wanted respite, the lesser it seemed plausible. money, marks, bloody numbers, jobs, and yet so less people interested in learning. when i was trying my hands at texas instruments analog design contest, i found it difficult to get a partner, given it had no leverage on marks. those who would latter help, would do it, solely so that the future publication at elsevier would have their names on it, and they could use it for their sop while applying for ms. nobody was doing it for love, for purpose. rewind, 2015. i had made up my mind. i had to go for ms. but then, lord giveth. lord taketh. my grandmom, had kidney failure. my uncle, being an agricultural labourer, failed to fulfill her medical expenses. our financial conditions became pretty bad. pretty pretty bad. so, my parents asked me to shelve plans, at least an year. so, priorities changed. you must get a job. campussing. job. your life will change. you will have financial independence. yo, i did land jobs. not one, two of them. people told jio was going to be the next big thing in telecom. i joined jio. life changed? haha, yeah. shit was going to happen. things that would change my life forever. an ethnocentric, egotist self , that treated all ""non science"" background people as idiots was going to change. i was going to change my way of looking at life. jio, 2016. merry making, joining parties, flurry of facebook posts. in 3 weeks time, i was in charge of a group of guys, who were a bit of trashcan to handle.(they said they were interns, and my team said to extract as much of testing as i could from them). but i told you, i was always one cocksure cully to deal with. my first few days, with those guys, they were the most gentle guys around. my manager mr xyz. (with a name, starting with a v word, that's a common meme term these days, related to acche din), started pressuring me to get them to raise a 1000 test cases a day, regarding connectivity issues and that too with a 3 member team. one fine morning i found these guys, foul mouthing this man and arguing with the hr, a lady, (and by far the worst crook i met till this day). my manager had lied to me. these guys werent interns. they were given a designation. assistant manager. i had found it earlier. but i didn't question. no. i didnt. because, that was not expected of me. neither in ny childhood. nor my adulthood. these people (later i found an absolutelot of so called assistant managers) had not been paid wages for 2 months. they were not given an official contract letter. everytime they asked, they were told they would be confirmed after medical tests report would be received. (and medicals happened in reliance campus itself). they shared with me their frustrations. i felt very bad. the worst. i asked myself, what am i doing? isn't it my moral responsibility to ask for these people? my brain told me, no, dont. shit will hit the fan. ah, those days of moral dichotomy. and then one day, these people were asked to leave, since they weren't upto the organizational standards. and no. they weren't paid any wages for 4 months. they left, but i asked myself, what kind of a supreme douchebag fails to take stand for those people with whom he spends 9 hours a day. i did my undercover sting, and i found some 73 people, who were undergoing the same fate. that day i made my mind. i will question. i gathered all the courage in my heart, and i went for lunch, took the exact1 opposite chair to that of mr. xyz. i asked him, that why were these poor brats not paid wages? (the new team assigned to me, were undergoing the same fate. however unlike the previous ones, these people believed that reliance wouldn't dump them). he replied, that the company will decide. a few more questions, and i could see that he was getting uncomfortable. peddling lies. finally he told me what i knew he would tell me, tumhe apna tankha tym pe milta hain naa, chup chap apna kaam karo. i would very well realize, that my tym here was coming to an end. (regarding mr xyz, this man was a typical specimen of a nit and iim passout blockhead. such was his knowledge that he told there was 1 high court and 24 supreme courts in our country in our intro session. i laughed. but most others applauded. maybe that's where we are collectively going nowadays). i could see the world changing. i prepared for aai and ibps( sbi ka form khatam ho chuka tha, and my peers told, psu will be better). one fine evening i was called by the lady hr. i was told, my performances weren't being good enough and i should take this as a warning. i slapped my notice period the next day, with a 1000 word letter to mr. abc who was the vp those days. and tell you what, i was told that i can be relieved before completing my notice. i didbt pay a damn, coz i had made it to aai atc. medical were pending. bade adieu to navi mumbai. education failed to teach me that i must question. experience taught me otherwise. not that i reaped any praise or reward, (in fact i was looked down upon with scorn and anger by all) but the fact that i tried to question, gave me confidence. confidence that i might fail, but it doesn't necessarily mean that i am wrong. aai atc, medical took place. i was to receive the worst nightmare i had to. i was rejected. i came to know i was color blind. all of a sudden, i had to make peace with the fact, that i did not have a job. my brains told me, that had i not started that january bs, i would have remained in my place, cozy and fine. all of a sudden, i could see everything going down the drain. i had problems recognizing other colors but blue previously, but no one cared. neither did i. i thought my relationship would end too, it was 4 years old then. i confessed to my girlfriend, and, all of a sudden i was looking at an uncertain future, with pretty less number of jobs (given in india, you dont end up with good core jobs in psus if you are color blind). fortunately i had also made it through ibps. april 1, i felt so lucky. but buddha had said, all fortune is the source of some misfortune. before joining banks, i was actually looking at what path i can choose. i was looking at my self, and asking what can i do, what suits my nature. it was here that i found civil services, something that i had looked upon with so much contempt and disregard before. yeah, i want to make positive changes. yeah, i want to make this place a better one. yeah, i want to raise my voice against stuff. it ticked a lot of boxes. and tbh, its not possible to change the system if you don't know it well. to make a software better you need to know it. even to hack it. i shelved my plans for ms. 2016, i joined one of the more famed psu banks in india. one of the big 3 (excluding sbi). life was joy and bliss and innocence. i was in the recovery section. shit hit the fan once more. i found out that one of the branches passed fictitious msme loans (mostly of the order of 4.xxx lakhs, because less than 5 means no investigation). these loans never had any recovery. and cgtmse coverage was used to recover stuff. i reported. my dm promised to investigate. my manager told me that the person used to be in disciplinary cell (the cell that metes out penalties to employees for stuff) and that her husband was dm/agm in our bank. and yeah. once again the ground below shattered . within a days notice, i was transferred to lawngtlai. another day. another resignation. this wasn't due to the fact that i was tired or anything. i was preparing for upsc, and it was just 2 more months left for prelims. they were already delaying my noc etc. ( as per this bank rules you need to inform the bank if you are appearing anywhere, that's what the hr told me). all this was taking a toll on my prep. i resigned. prelims 2017 wasn't the easiest. but i didn't fare too badly. given the shitstorm i underwent. results came. i failed. by 2 marks. today, i stand, voluntarily unemployed. but i can tell you people few things i learned, from my experience. that our education fails to teach us 1. its okay to fail. we all must fail. accept it. move on. our education speaks so much about success. it cherry picks the stories of success. but it fails to tell you that 90% of us will fail in our goal. 2. have a purpose. a life without purpose is a meaningless life. i see these people waking up everyday going to jobs. they never ask why they are doing it. in their private counters they accept that they are doing it for money. they have monetised their lives. 3. question. insurrection is the bloody most supreme of all duties said lafayette, and it holds true everytime. everywhere. question. your own self. why? why you are doing something that you are doing. 4. enjoying your life and being happy is a choice. yes. you want to be happy? enjoy cherish and value all that you have. you have much more than you actually think you have. 5. invest in human relationships. that's the best thing to do. talk with your parents. your girlfriend. the unconditional support these people have provided me, in spite of all the trouble i have been giving them, i can only be indebted to them. sorry for such a long post. wrote it all on mobile. actually, had a lot of free time after prelims, so, decided to share the story of my life. there's so much more left to share. thank you for audience.",none,5

[here]( are more of my mindless ramblings on travel budgets. **beware of situational advice** a lot of travel advice is brilliant in one scenario and retarded in another. be careful of following tips subject to a gray area as if they are black &amp; white: - some destinations are better in the off-season and others are worse. - sometimes it’s smart to book hostels/hotels in advance, sometimes you’re better to go with the flow and maintain flexibility. - sometimes taking a tour completely ruins an experience, sometimes it’s leaps and bounds better than trying to do it solo. - remember that everyone is different. there is no “right” way - even my arrogant ass ought to be ignored from time to time. - there are pros &amp; cons to hauling a full-sized pack with all your goodies and pros &amp; cons to traveling for 6 months with a fanny pack, 2 pairs of undies and a bottle of febreeze.",none,5

0ee6a908-ca12-44f3-8a2f-98224a9d0de1,how would i go about solving this problem?,"consider a game with two players. each player starts with a certain amount of tokens (say 100 each). each turn, they gain a set number of tokens (say 10 each). they then bid a number of tokens, between 0 and the amount they currently have. each player bids without knowing what the other player has bid (a 'blind simultaneous bid'). each layer loses the number of tokens they bid. if one player bid more than the other, that player gains a point. the game ends when one player is a certain amount ahead (say 10 points). player's don't lose by running out of tokens. my question is this: is there a strategy such that no other strategy has a more than 50% chance of beating it? i think the answer is yes, and i think it would involve bidding a number of tokens randomly chosen from a range of numbers. but i have no idea how to start working out what that range would be. i asked this question on but didn't get any good answers.",none,5

7bdc48ef-9de1-497b-8a0d-509d85704425,an open letter to the republican national committee: i am your demographic and you've lost my vote,"i am your demographic. i am a white, middle-class, male, 40-something. white collar, family man, a son of immigrants, former military, patriot, and raised catholic. i have voted republican in almost every primary and election since i turned 18. that means i voted for reagan, bush, dole, and bush. last election i was so disillusioned with you, i voted for obama. this year neither one of the main candidates will get my vote, and let me tell you why. i am a middle-class, white collar businessman and have been for 20 years. i watched through the latest crisis how the people that bankroll you and you pass laws for have absolutely destroyed the economy in this country. offshoring, outsourcing, downsizing, rightsizing, securitization; all doctrines used in the name of ""shareholder value"" that have eviscerated the middle class and eliminated entire industries. i have seen friends' careers destroyed, neighborhoods laid waste, and whole communities suffer all for a little more eps. these people you take your orders from are criminal and traitors and should all be behind bars, some of you included. i am a technophile. oil is a dead-end technology. stop trying to squeeze a drop of blood from that stone and come up with a strategic approach to energy independence. electric, solar, wind, geothermal, and nuclear are all methods of generating domestic energy. they will create investment and jobs. stop whipping up the uneducated against electric cars and high-speed trains. these are mature technologies that can immediately stop sending our money to overseas despots that absolutely hate us. a portion of every dollar you send overseas makes dead american soldiers. which leads me to... i am former military, the son of immigrants, and member of the nra. my family came to this country for freedom and opportunity because america was the land where you could do anything you dreamed. you have corrupted that. i have been to too many military funerals and memorial ceremonies for good young men who died overseas, and for what? why are we over there, anywhere? no one wants us there anymore, including our hosts. bring the boys home, close the bases, defend america instead of these militaristic junkets you support so rabidly. we have a military that is larger exponentially than our nearest enemy. it is unnecessary and wasteful. stop giving money to our adversaries in foreign aid and focus on rebuilding this country. on that same note, i am a patriot, and the tsa and ""homeland security"" are an abomination. i could quote jefferson, franklin, adams, washington, or hamilton here but it's pointless. you know them, but you either ignore them or twist them for your own ends. the founding fathers would be rising up themselves today if they could see how the constitution has been indefinitely detained itself. the patriot act, ndaa, and all of the bastard children of those laws need to stop. it actually turns my stomach now when the word ""security"" comes on any news report, which is about a dozen times an hour. you are making americans fearful which will be our downfall. additionally, the war on drugs is lost. legalize, tax, regulate, and provide treatment. every country who has done this is light years ahead of us in terms of bringing this under control. then again without a militarized police force you are unable to keep the populace in line as easily. i am white. i have no fear of other races, cultures, creeds, or nationalities. i do business with muslims, pakistanis, israelis, chinese, mexicans, germans, english, japanese, and of course americans. they are all people just like me. i have served with many of those people, had relationships with all races and cultures, and am friends with anyone who is a good person. holding any ethnic group responsible for the actions of a few is reprehensible and anytime i hear about ""the muslims"" in a general negative light, you shift me further away. i am catholic. and i don't care about abortion, contraception, or gay marriage as political issues. abortion is a lost issue (see roe v. wade). if you get it back in front of the supreme court, then talk about it. it's polarizing and no good comes from talking about it. contraception as a political issue? are you kidding me? and gay marriage? what's the value in even discussing that? who cares what people do in their own homes? whatever happened to the separation of church and state?. education costs are out of control. healthcare is unattainable for many. unemployment is sky-high. these are the issues you should be addressing. bill clinton, whom i detest, had one thing right for certain: ""it's the economy, stupid"". your field of candidates is functionally insane in my opinion. i voted obama last time because the idea mccain/palin in office scared the shit out of me. romney? santorum? gingrich? this is the best you can put forward? until you take a rational position on any of the above and start focusing on what's good for the country as a whole, you have lost my vote. my only hope is that enough of my fellow citizens, both democrat and republican take the same stance. **edit:** fixed typo. wow, main page. i didn't expect my frustrated rant to generate such a response. thank you all for your kind comments. **edit 2:** i was deliberately trying to avoid discussing congressman paul, although many people have posted and messaged me about my position on him, for two reasons: one, for better or worse, he will likely not be the offered candidate. no matter the reasons, it appears highly unlikely he will receive the nomination. as a result... two, he is a lightning rod. although i agree with some of his positions and disagree with some of his positions, i didn't want those debates to detract from my main points above because that would not have been productive. congressman paul is obviously a libertarian candidate running as a republican. he does not fit into the same category as those listed above, in my opinion.",none,5

1059c54b-1816-427e-8237-f0f6622af2d2,after 5 months of worldwide travel (out of 10) here is what we used the most for items packed (makes more sense for canada/us),"i see a lot of packing threads but i thought that i'd emphasize the things that we thought we could get cheaply/good quality outside of canada or the us but couldn't and what we were glad we did bring. 1. waiters friend. easier to open wine with, any pop top (we've actually used it more for soda, not american 'soda' just carbonated water), and the knife is great for cutting citrus or opening bags. i have been in some really rural areas and very few times have i really missed an actual knife but some people seem to love them and even at home use every opportunity to show everyone they have a handy knife and use it for any fucking thing. 2. foldable camp sink. we have used this every day. we clean our camping cutlery in it (i got far less delhi belly once i realized that it was the cutlery not being washed properly, in many places just cold rinsed cough**morocco &amp; se asia food stalls**cough. in asia, those pink napkins are used by many locals to do a final wipe down before using) we do laundry which to me seems more sanitary than various sinks, especially in many less developed countries. 3. sawyer filter. i don't think you can get it here in canada but it's all over montana. it's super cheap (under $20), lasts forever (almost literally at 100k and 1 million gallons) before needing to be replaced, flows fast, and filters better than the far more expensive ones. i've saved hundreds bordering on a thousand in bottled water using this in 5 months. 4. sunblock. i thought i could buy sunblock for a reasonable price in africa (at least in areas with white people i assumed), europe, asia. nope. i don't know about aus/nz but it's fucking expensive elsewhere. i would have bought 4 large ones and took the hit on weight had i known. in germany i could buy one small bottle with 200ml for the price of about 4 litres in canada or more in the us. most of the rest of central/western europe is similar or slightly cheaper. southern and western africa is a bit cheaper (dar es salaam and jo'burg the cheapest) but still a lot more. at all the big c or boots in asia and local pharmacies it's really expensive as well. 3-5x more than back home (or more if it's summer back home). and you need a lot of it every day. it adds up to a lot of money. outside of europe/n. america it also has whitening cream hidden in nearly all products except boots brand and the really fucking expensive brand name ones from the west. maybe malaysia or indonesia or vietnam will be cheaper. 5. headlamp and any outdoor stuff like cross trainers. it's far, far cheaper in north america. cross trainers are also way better (albiet uglier) than hiking boots and if you like to explore like me, far more practical than converse. they can be washed and dried fast. i've used the headlamp a few times a week, and everyday i was staying in dorms. my feet have been saved by the cross trainers. i see tourists in africa and asia wearing sandles all the time and their arches make their gait look painful. many asians as well. i like sandles and use them a lot but i don't want to buy really expensive ones (olukai) for long distance walking. 6. hard plastic nalgenes/camelbacks: can't find them in many countries and when you do they are expensive. multiple times a day we use them. they will be trashed when we come back and then we just use the warranty to get new ones. by now you should know not to reuse cheap plastic bottles. 7. camp suds/hand sanitizer: washing cultery, sometimes clothing, sometimes hands, sometimes face and body, can act as shampoo. not as good as specialized things in most respects but adequate in nearly everything it advertises for (long hair notwithstanding). sanitizer is not common at all in west africa and less common in se asia. you will use it all the time. 8. compression sack/waterproof bag: again, much cheaper back home. buy it there. 9. laptop (asus t100ta): i watch movies on long rides and in my downtime, do my taxes on it, i like the larger screen for skype, i update my webpage, etc.... i got mine off of kijiji on warranty still for 2 years after i return for $180 with 64gb memory. not even close to that cheap outside of n. america 7 months ago. 10. a good camera: phone cameras are now pretty damn good in ideal conditions but pretty shitty elsewhere. i don't want to take a giant dslr so i opted for the best p&amp;s i could find and i take just as good of pictures as most dslr's in many conditions. i have a sony rx100m2. it's glorious and with an ultra pod 2 low light or long exposure isn't a problem either. they are fucking expensive everywhere outside of canada/us. hundreds more. buy some extra batteries and a good charger before you leave. this is true for all electronics. the exception is cheaper cords and shit in asia like pantip, but then they might not be as good quality or might not work well on finicky things like my asus. we have a nano for music as well and it's 50%-150% more expensive outside of n. america. 11. my girlfriend said many types of tampons she couldn't find in africa (the largest cities too with many expats as well as asia in huge cities it was tough). they love pads, she doesn't. there are reusable ones she bought that she uses too that work well. she didn't use a shewee as much as she thought. once. and then someone will have a sarong or umbrella to shield you from stares. 12. a travel towel. 13. spending the time to transfer our money into banks that have debit cards on the visa plus network so the atm fees are far less. also using a credit card that doesn't charge a foreign conversion fee is more than worth the hassle of getting a new one. 14. getting enough usd for visas. the cdn is shitting the bed against the usd but it will get lower, as will most currencies so buy it now, even though the rate is painful. maybe later this year some ground will be made up. i've never needed usd in any country for anything but visas. not even myanmar or zimbabwe (we used credit cards in the latter along with rand and debit/credit/kyat) in the former. everything else we could have replentished or got over here for more money, but not enough to give you sticker shock. maybe outdoor/sports clothing, especially quick dry stuff which is very useful. meds are much cheaper in africa/asia and they are cheaper in canada then in the us even if you are foreign. they are about the same in europe if you are foreign. electrolytes are much, much cheaper abroad (you will get the shits many times). travel vaccines are much cheaper but for most ones that require multiple shots, it makes more sense getting at home. oh ya, canadians fucking love peanut butter. it's my go to cheap breakfast when i am on the run with fruit or toast or whatever or hungary and not by a food stall or don't want something fried again. americans love it too but nobody else seems to so it's hard to find and expensive when you do. i wish i would have brought a jar to start me off. i hate wasting time trying to find my crack. i don't know if the jokes about koreans and kimchi or aussies and vegemite in thier bags abroad are true, but i wouldn't be ashamed to be caught with a kilo of adams natural. also, for those that are true celiacs (as my girlfriend is) they don't make ricecakes in much of se asia (i guess i ignorantly assumed they did). we usually ate peanut butter on ricecakes for breakfast on those early as fuck bus rides in africa but no dice in much of se asia. they import them in tops from the uk but they are about $6 canadian for a pack that costs $0.40 in canada. i've also recently learned that for the cost of 2 nights in a basic bungalow, you can buy a decent tent at bigc and camp at most places at a fraction of the cost, bedding included. i love to camp and fan bungalows can be sweltering down south so this is a welcome thing to know. i've use it about 10 nights so far in southern thailand and planning 7 more that i know of. cost me 800 baht for the tent and about 100 baht a night with bedding and a space for two people at most islands. that's 1800 baht (70cdn or less usd, most of that is my tent cost) for 10 nights so far and it will only get cheaper compared to staying in really basic bungalows (i prefer simple accomodation in beach areas near the water). we share a bathroom but unless i am staying at a nice place, the bathrooms in the beach areas are often dank and smelly so an en suite isn't my first choice. the tent is light and cheap and between out two bags it won't be a problem to pack so we'll try it in indonesia and back in the west coast from san diego up. if i give it away before, who cares, it's already paid for.",none,5

(dont mention anything about the rental rates). she comes home and i'm furious (not with her because she frankly has no clue about anything, but with the airtel guys) i immediately dial 198 and get in touch with a customer care executive and he assures me that 1) the amount i lost ( i paid 3 months pre-paid which i lost) will be refunded by cheque in 90 days) 2) he's immediately switching me back to pre-paid (told me it would happen within a week) and 3) i would not have to pay any charges for all this mess until the change. fast forward 3 weeks, my sim is still postpaid despite numerous follow ups with them and i am now billed for 407 rs. for the first month of the postpaid plan. i am livid. i call back customer care and they tell me they cant help me and the previous guy ""must have not told that to you"" (so they basically called me a liar) or he was ""wrong"" with no explanation for it. he tells me that i wont receive any refund, there's no pre-paid request made on my number and taunts me with ""go do it"" when i threaten him with consumer court. he also refuses to give a reference number to the call or the complaint as thats ""not a part of the policy"" which means they can deny that i even called them. i give up and decide to just pay and port out. but guess what? even that is a web and a maze. i just made my bill payment through debit card and the money is already debited. however, i didn't get a payment confirmation. apparently it takes 6 days for airtel to acknowledge payment for money it has already received. and the last date for my bill payment is in 5 more days. i dont even know how trai allows this shit. bravo. just bravo. i just hope i can port the fuck out. i'm genuinely scared i wont be able to because airtel might consider the change over to postpaid as a new connection and wont let me go till the 90 days are up. fuck you airtel.",none,5

[p],"you literally can't talk about dera sachha sauda violence without discussing why deras were created in punjab and how their role and warped and changed over time. there's no point to being 'horrified'. dss has given thousands of people across north india an identity away from the historical oppression they've known. it's given them safety. a huge number of its members are from backwards castes, who had converted to sikhism, but found the same upper caste oppression there too. sikhism is, in theory, casteless. the ground realities, however, are sobering and unfortunate. the jat-khatri coterie has taken over religious politicking, especially representation in sgpc and other gurudwara committee. they've systematically kept new converts out of the loop and have actively oppressed them because they represent a status quo shakeup. this (along with other factors) has led to people being angry, helpless, disillusioned. they see no way out, no way up. they turn to drugs. punjab and nasha have become synonymous, and this has been worsened by economic insecurity+lack of education. they're a lost people. so when the dera sachha sauda comes up as a saviour organisation, they're interested. of course they are. the dera promises them dignity. they dera educates its people, feeds them, keeps them off drugs, gives them jobs, gives them a purpose. it gives them a dignity of being. a lost man doesn't care if a rapist gives him direction. a hungry man will take food from a murderer's hand. never forget this. what you see isn't *just* an expression of misogyny and religious fervour. that too, yes, but it's actively an expression of insecurity too. what you and i see as justice, a large number of people see as a possible slide down to the pits they've barely emerged from. what you see on the today has been simmering over a generation and a half. in our race to *appear* developed, we forgot that development, as understood by very rudimentary economics, is unfair, unjust, unequal, and problematic. if nothing else, this should serve as a lesson. if we try to climb up by stepping on someone else's broken back, those people will rise. politicians understand this. they know a votebank when they see one, that's why they're politicians. they've been allowing these deras to flourish and mutate. think of this as a very messed up, but immensely effective delegation system. they support the deras in their bullshit knowing the votebank will be appeased by them. this allows deras a free reign. the deras will fight each other, they will fight within themselves, and they will go to any lengths to 'win'. the politicians allow this because it also makes deras comfortably indebted to them. think of divine right of rule. same principle applies. what you have is a reckless product that feeds off people's insecurities and replaces their drugs with a more potent one- faith&amp;security. religion might be an opiate, but faith? man, that's a trip if i ever saw one. dss has a veritable army of people willing to kill for it. and we made this. we allowed this with our apathy. when you look down on the protestors, remember this. we're culpable too, massively so. edit: formatting changes. previously submitted on my mobile. edit2: post is written by ms. harnidh kaur.",none,5

7c79dcc8-696f-4bbb-81ef-cdb3f0b9d64d,"dear patanjali, is your shampoo safe enough for our precious hair? your advertisement facts say otherwise!","so today i came upon this ad on newspaper: &gt; shampoos contain sodium laureth sulphate (sls), a surfactant found in many cleansing product. also an insecticide, the sodium and ammonium laureate sulphates are known cancer-causing ingredients. also causes liver damage, skin rashes, depression, diarrhea and eye damage. all of their shampoos, *kesh kanti milk protein: *kesh kanti anti dandruff: *kesh kanti alovera: *kesh kanti shikakai: *kesh kanti natural: *kesh kanti reetha: are surfactant based, they aren’t mentioning what surfactant they are using. so i guess they are using als (ammonium laureth sulfate) which most herbal brand uses including khadi, but no one never mentions it. here’s a natural surfactant list: thanks to but patanjali is saying: &gt; the sodium and ammonium laureate sulphates are known cancer-causing ingredients. also causes liver damage, skin rashes, depression, diarrhea and eye damage. okay patanjali, that’s okay let’s move on to other points. &gt;dimethicone is silicon oil that can make the scalp and skin incredibly dry and irritated. found in shampoos, it forms an almost plastic-like barrier on the outside of the skin and traps bacteria, sebum and impurities with it. it is also an eye irritant and non-biodegradable and horrible for the environment. wth patanjali your own so called 100% natural product contains dimethicone! *kesh kanti shikakai shampoo: *kesh kanti almond hair conditioner: *kesh kanti damage control hair conditioner: oops! busted. ;) &gt;the goodness of all the herbs, together with henna, shikakai, tulsi and others is brought together by patanjali in its kesh kanti hair cleansers and oils. with 100% natural ingredients and the pure goodness of ayurveda, embrace patanjali for the best hair care. maybe they should retire the term ‘100% natural ingredients’ because their own hair cleansers including kesh kanti reetha, natural, shikakai &amp; milk protein except anti dandruff and alovera contains diazolidinyl urea. according to wikipedia: &gt;diazolidinyl urea is found in the commercially available preservative germaben. &gt;germaben ii contains parabens, some studies have raised concerns that these substances may be carcinogenic owing to their effect of mimicking the body's hormone estrogen. according to: &gt;a lot of controversy surrounds the safety of diazolidinyl urea. many believe it to be both toxic and carcinogenic, mainly due to the fact that it's a proven formaldehyde releaser. however, the cosmetic ingredient review (cir) expert panel evaluated the available data on this ingredient (and reevaluated it in 2006) and concluded it as safe to use on cosmetic products at a maximum concentration of .5%. their studies demonstrated it to be neither toxic nor photosensitizing. however, tests did show it to produce mild skin irritations in some (1 out of 1000), so this ingredient should probably avoided by those with very sensitive skin. &gt;while it is fair to say that no available data leads us to confidently categorize diazolidinyl urea as toxic and carcinogenic, many well respected scientists and doctors still recommend avoiding it. in you being beautiful, doctors michael roizen and mehmet oz include it on their list of ingredients to avoid. this is because it may be contaminated by formaldehyde. see the sentence “while it is fair to say that no available data leads us to confidently categorize diazolidinyl urea as toxic and carcinogenic, many well respected scientists and doctors still recommend avoiding it.” ? i’m so confused patanjali, first you make certain claims like sls and als are known cancer causing ingredient then completely forgot mentioning diazolidinyl urea that exists in your products?! now i have checked three different shampoo in our home: clear anti dandruff, wow 10in1 miracle shampoo and tresemme hair fall shampoo but none of them seem to contain it. and wtf is “sugandhit dravya”, can’t you simply name it as perfume? yeah you guys got reasons because i guess “sugandhit dravya” sounds less chemical-e? this doesn’t end here, their damage control hair conditioner contains quaternium. according to wikipedia: &gt;some consumer cosmetics contain quaternium-15 for its antimicrobial properties. the american cancer society states that although quaternium-15 releases formaldehyde, a known carcinogen in laboratory test animals at relatively high doses, because the amount of formaldehyde released from these products is low, it is unclear that avoiding quaternium-15 in cosmetics provides any health benefits. even so, johnson &amp; johnson announced plans to phase out its use of quaternium-15 in cosmetic products by 2015 in response to consumer pressure. so what do we learn from this, don’t believe in this 100% natural, 100% pure ayurveda chutiyapa and largely in this stupid company who has questionable r&amp;d and simply wants to sell us products in the name of swadeshi, saving and servicing the nation. what do you expect from a company who wants us buy their product because it’s cheaper than the rest and most of the time they aren’t because patanjali thinks we buy all products in mrp with no discounts? compare this products with the rest and you’ll see patanjali just copy pasted the mrp while we get them at cheaper rate, little to no difference from patanjali’s pricing in some products. yeah some other companies does the same but patanjali is no better. thanks for reading, have a nice day! :)",none,5

9c84e702-37e1-4de1-b1ee-c271137df933,a very simplified explanation of how 3rd party booking sites generally make money,"inspired by the hotel employee's somewhat ""controversial"" thread on insider tips and information - i wanted to do a quick write-up on how otas such as expedia &amp; booking generally work when calculating your room rate. disclaimer: i say ""generally"" because not every ota is structured in the same way and agreements made with individual properties (particularly massively large hotel chains) are going to vary slightly...but this is the gist of how it works. but we did extensive research on this subject when looking into ways to market our hotel and i've negotiated both with expedia and booking and have read their contracts front to back. at the end i'll explain the major differences from the hotel's point of view for these two otas and why we chose to list with booking and not with expedia - and then why we decided to end our contract with booking, too :) **the basic setup** there's a misnomer out there that expedia ""buys"" huge blocks of rooms at wholesale prices and then marks these rooms up to sell them. while they might do this with some properties, the general way the arrangement works is like this: say a hotel has 100 rooms. they'll agree to set aside say 10 of these rooms for expedia to book for them. they must guarantee this number of rooms for the specified time periods. when you book with expedia they don't check availability with the hotel so to speak, they simply assume a room is available as long as they have one left in their allotment. surely some hotels choose to book these rooms and hope they don't overbook but they're not ""supposed to"". the reason that expedia usually doesn't allow same-day bookings is that this inventory goes back to the hotel 3 days prior to the date so that the hotel can use these rooms for walk-ins or last-minute bookings. so...the hotel gives a price to expedia for these rooms. expedia strongly suggests that the hotel choose a price lower than the rack rate but by the terms of the contract the price they give expedia cannot exceed the rack rate. if the rack rate is $100/night then this is the maximum price the hotel can give to expedia. officially the hotel cannot offer a better price than the one they quote expedia on their official website but of course properties try to skirt the rules on this one. so let's say hotel x gives 10 rooms at $100/night to expedia to book and expedia agrees to do it for a 20% commission (this is the rate they offered us when i spoke to them)...that means that hotel x gets paid $80 for every time expedia books that room. but...expedia can choose to charge whatever they'd like for this room (and this is very clear in the contract)...meaning that they can list it at $90 and simply earn $10 per booking instead of $20. what this does is essentially immediately undercut the hotel's rate - and for this reason a lot of hotels choose to not list with expedia (like us). in many cases where a 4th party site compares 3rd party booking engines, the different otas will compete on price for the same room. a buddy of mine worked as a programmer for a contractor working with expedia trying to perfect their ""guessing"" algorithm for such services. so basically when you search room rates on say, tripadvisor, tripadvisor sends a quick message to all the otas offering rooms at that property to say ""how much?"" and each ota tries to guess what the other otas will charge, working to both undercut the competition and maximize margin at the same time - this all happens in seconds and is done by algorithms. this is why rooms generally are cheaper from otas. but...often the savings is small enough that you're still better to book direct with the hotel. why save $3 to forego the benefits of working directly with the company? in addition it's common practice to give the property's shittiest rooms to ota bookings since the profit margin is so low on these sales...in fact, many hotels actually lose money on these bookings and only participate with 3rd party sites for marketing purposes. booking works in a more simplified manner. they charged us a flat commission of 15% on every booking and we had full control via a control panel to add/delete inventory in real time. we could choose to not offer any rooms during our peak periods and we could book out rooms that were reserved for booking at any time, as long as we logged in and pulled that room out of inventory immediately. with expedia you set aside the rooms ahead of time to ensure availability whereas with booking you have more responsibility to monitor inventory and lower the number of rooms booking can book to make sure there is always space. another key difference between expedia and booking is that expedia collects the money from customers and later pays you whereas with booking you collect the money and are invoiced every month for all your commission from guests whose stay finished that month. **the reason we canned booking** not going with expedia was an easy choice. while perhaps using them for a year or two would have helped get our name out there faster, the 20% commission per night was too much, particularly since our rates include 3-meals per day. we would have been losing a huge chunk of our profit margin and would have to give up part of our inventory that wouldn't be available for us to book ourselves until 3 days before the date. but with booking we liked the idea of being able to list rooms just in the shoulder season and that we could book these rooms out at any time. anyhow...the reason we later annulled our contract with them was that they were absolutely awful to work with: 1. they did not allow hotels to write their own property description. the description is written by booking staff based off your amenities. we called/emailed them on multiple occasions to explain that our property description described nothing about what our place was really like and they did nothing. on top of this, it was clear that the person who wrote our description was not a native english speaker and it sounded terrible. i sent them a reasonable description (following their guidelines) and asked them to at the very least clean up the english so it sounded like a native speaker wrote it but they refused. i have no idea if the text was written by someone here in mexico or elsewhere. 2. booking's location generator was based purely off longitude and latitude....so this meant that we were listed as being in tlachicon, mexico, which isn't even a place, haha...it's just what google maps has this area listed under. seriously, i don't know anywhere near here with that name. i explained to them on multiple occasions that we needed to be listed under puerto escondido because that was the market that we served or nobody would ever see our listing. they didn't listen and it was clear from the hits to our booking page that i was right and nobody was even finding the page to read the shitty english in the first place. after a year of fighting with them to help me tweak our page to give it a chance of generating reservations we just decided to cancel our agreement with them. at any rate...this is not meant to be a guide to using otas or an endorsement for or against booking with them - it's just meant to be a peek behind the scenes to see how they make money, why their prices ~~are~~ may be cheaper and why a hotel might not treat expedia bookings with the same respect - it's because they're not really making much money off you.",none,5

561dcc0f-7c8a-4be4-aa90-902d54a0ffab,this month marks 11 years as an expat.,"it dawned on me this morning that it's now been 11 years since i left home for good. i'm also at the tipping point where i've now spent more of my adult life outside the us rather than in, which is an odd thing to think about despite the fact that i'm far from a patriot. with so many posts in here coming from recent grads wondering how to balance career and travel goals i thought i'd share my story &amp; experience, which of course ought to be taken with a grain of salt as everyone's situation is personal and unique. i'll mostly skip over the flat out ""traveling"" years and talk more about the process of living and building a life overseas...but to make a long story short i went to europe literally 24 hours after finishing business school and discovered in 6 short weeks what most of you in here already know: there's more to life than new cars, picket fences and 401k's. i tried to balance career and travel but it never worked out...for 6 years or so after university i'd repeat the cycle of ""come home, put on my suit, lie my way through some interviews, work for a while and quit to travel."" in my personal experience it's pretty tough to both have a ""traditionally"" successful career and travel extensively. so eventually i decided to teach in korea for a year. just 1 year and then come home to figure out the next step. but i met my wife (who was also teaching there) and never went back...not to live, anyway. the first year away was quite the roller-coaster ride. the first few months were amazing as i was essentially doing the same stuff i did as a traveler except for the 40 hours out of the week i had to be in the classroom...and then i hit this wall and realized ""wait a second, i'm not traveling, i actually live here and i can't just keep partying like this for the entire year."" so then i focused on getting a little more settled in and that was cool for awhile until i just hit this point where i was ready to go home...the novelty had worn off and i missed my friends and i missed society making sense and i missed all sorts of things that at the time i suddenly felt were important (food, golf, professional sports, etc.). but since i was on contract i fought through this period, which lasted maybe 2 months and then all of a sudden i didn't miss home anymore...and literally in the 10+ years since that point i've never missed home again. by the time my year was up i started to get excited again about going home for a couple months but when i arrived all the shit i thought was so important wound up being ""meh""...yeah, it was fun to go to a baseball game and hang out in our old stomping grounds, see friends, etc, etc, but it didn't take more than a week to realize that nothing had changed in all the time i was away and everyone was just doing the same shit in the same routine. my girlfriend and i then met back up again in thailand where we did the celta course and then we landed jobs in saigon. vietnam was far more exotic and interesting than korea but living in the heart of the city was intense. i think vietnam makes an amazing travel destination but for living it was a bit too intense as the noise, traffic and pollution wear you down over time. from there we moved on to chile to experience teaching in latin america...we enjoyed living in santiago but the financial side of things wasn't nearly as easy as it was in asia. we also decided at this point that we wouldn't want to teach forever and that we'd like to start our own business somehow related to tourism. we went back to korea with the sole purpose of saving capital to start our own business. our plan was to be there just one year but then as our business plans morphed we wound up staying for three. originally we were thinking of some sort of guided tour company or perhaps even a tour/esl deal, where we'd take koreans on bus tours of europe and do classes on the road...but over time we realized that what we really wanted was to build our own place. we talked first about a hostel and then opted against that, figuring that in the long-run we'd tire of all the bullshit related to hostel life. face it...it's fun as a traveler but as an owner/manager all the shenanigans would get old pretty quick. so we instead opted to open a small boutique childfree beach resort....which is a whole other story, of course. we arrived to mexico 4.5 years ago and gecko rock has now been open for 2. so it's taken over a decade to come full circle...we love living in mexico but in many ways we're just as settled now as anyone else...we've got a dog and 4 cats and spend way too much time watching netflix when we should be at the beach...and we crave travel and new places just as much as ever, regardless of the fact that we live in paradise. whenever i go home for a visit i can't help but end up briefly wondering the classic what ifs...almost all of my friends are earning six figures and i'm at that age point where mates are getting really big promotions....but these feelings don't last long. in our experience we did hit that point on the road where we said, ""hey, we don't want to go home (we're not both from the same country anyway) but we don't want to be stuck teaching english for the next 30 years,"" and the transition between happy go-lucky esl teacher and businessperson was tough...we had to work our asses off and save like crazy, essentially putting a 5 year hold on our life to make this transition work. there's no question that making the

106bf2e8-e8ab-4964-a28f-1ffac7e4f615,how to study maths,"mathematics is a subject in which we all face problems. due to the fact that maths contain practical some student may not like this subject. if you study maths in the right way the problems are much easy to solve 9 tips for maths problem solving 1. regularity in study of mathematics the most important thing in the study of maths is regularity. you should see that you are working regularly. distribute your time properly for all the subjects. avoid the habit of studying all the night and then sleeping during day. this is unnatural and will do no good to your preparation. you can also set particular time for maths. as it will prepare your mind mentally. 2. try yourself question at the end of each topic and in between in each exercise a set of unsolved questions are given along with the answers and necessary hint wherever necessary. don't rely on examples, try yourself exercise question to proper clarity of topic. also you will find the list of important formulae of the particular topic. 3. practice no one is perfect in anything, practice make man perfect. regular practice of maths help you to understand it. the more you practice answering maths problems the better it is. there is no escaping from maths, to do well in maths exam you need to have solved a lot of mathematics problems beforehand. 4. hard question in the case you fumble over a question, think for 5 minutes. if you got no idea to solve rest of the question then leave it. sometime leaving the question is the best way to solve the question. after 1 hour take that question again, if you are not able to solve the question take the question to your teacher. here the most important thing is fighting with your question. if you don't think about questions you won't be able to solve the hard questions in exam. 5. never read mathematics always adope pen and paper for doing mathematics otherwise you will be simply deceiving yourself. you will never be able to reproduce the solution of a question in the examination unless or until you have done it earlier in writing. 6. before going to your class in order to take the maximum benefit out of books, you should always before going to your class read the portion of your book which your teacher is going to discuss in the class. this will create greater interest in the lecture. you can also clear some points from your teacher which you might not have been able to understand independently from the book. 7. important formula's there are certain basic and standard formula's of various branches of mathematics which every student is expected to know, but it is found that the students are not definite about these standard result of trigonometry, differential and integral calculus, co-ordinate geometry etc. you are therefore, advised to leave a small margin in your copy and write in it the formula's about which you are not sure and which is required for the solution of that particular problem. this will demarcate what you knows and what you do not know and will facilitate the work of revision also. a list of such formula's is given at the back of each chapter 8. revision before examination in order to simplify the work of revision before examination, you should while preparing any book or its chapter, mark ""r"" with red ink in your copy those questions which you feel are difficult or require some special trick or method and which you are likely to forget. only these questions may be looked and revised the day before the examination. do not include in this list those type of questions which are based on direct application of formula and which you can always do. 9. how to attempt paper in examination avoid over-writing and scratching in the copy. look to note given in the paper and attempt first the question which you know well. attempt maximum number of questions. always revise your answers. keep left side of your page for rough work and cross it. in case you fumble over a question in the paper, do not waste much time over it and no need to be nervous. look to some other question about which you are confident and start solving it.",none,5

ae522dae-50af-44c1-a9b8-6ec33003fc14,"100% of congress will be on the ballot this november, 85%-98% will be reelected despite their 76% disapproval rating, mostly because only 40% of eligible voters will go to the polls.","*100% of the house of representatives will be on the ballot this november. i'd like to take this text box to address some of the misconceptions i've heard about voting, politics and politicians. 1. ""all politicians are the same."" this is simply not the case. does bernie sanders advocate for war as often as john mccain? is elizabeth warren as loved by wall street as scott brown? is ted cruz as liberal as donna edwards? the answer to all of these is; of course, no. assuming that there's no difference is in complete opposition to the facts. 2. ""nothing changes anyway, what's the point in voting?"" seven years ago don't ask, don't tell was still official policy, we were still at war in iraq, osama binladen was chilling in pakistan; eight years before that we were running a budget surplus and we had an unemployment rate of 4.5%; a century ago women didn't have the right to vote and fifty years before that african americans weren't recognized as fully human. things change, but only if we work towards them. maybe it's not happening as quickly as you would like, but that's a reason to go out and vote, not a reason to stay home. 3. ""my vote doesn't matter."" only 40% of eligible voters will be showing up this november; in presidential elections around 60% of eligible voters go to the polls, that means that **your vote is worth substantially more** in midterm elections than it is during national elections. pacs and superpacs and ""news"" organizations are going to be spending billions this year trying to convince you to vote for candidate x, apathetic friends will be spending hours trying to convince you not to go to the polls at all, that's a lot of time and money wasted on something that doesn't matter. 4. ""mid-term elections don't matter."" mid-term election often matter *more* than national elections. the fact of the matter is that congress has substantially more power than the president and as such has substantially more impact on your daily life. look at how much can be accomplished by a motivated congress, great things like the civil rights act, the interstate highway system, social security and medicare, none of which would could have been enacted by the president or the senate alone. by comparison look at what happens with a recalcitrant congress: government shutdowns, credit downgrades, cutting of long term unemployment benefits and fifty some ""symbolic votes."" 5. ""my district is too gerrymandered for my vote to have any impact."" gerrymandering is certainly a huge problem, and we voters need to address it, but gerrymandering doesn't effect senatorial or gubernatorial elections, nor does it impact state-wide ballot initiatives or referendums. i would argue that if your state or district is gerrymandered you have even *more* reason to vote. 6. ""i don't vote on purpose, i'm sending a message that i don't support the system."" you're not sending a message, you're choosing to be invisible. no politician or political body will ever sit back, look at the 30% turnout and thing ""gee, something's wrong here, we'd better fix it!"" no, a politician will look at the 30% turnout and say ""well *i* got elected, so why should i change anything? clearly only the right voters went to the polls."" not voting isn't peaceful protest, not voting is sitting at home and *watching* the protest. ***if you want to make a statement, don't skip voting! put in the write in candidate ""no confidence."" hell, write in ""no confidence"" for everyone on the ballot, but go and vote!*** i can promise you that 100% turnout with 60% doing a write in will send a *much* bigger message than 40% turnout with 60% staying home. **""nobody is ever elected by people who don't vote."" -/u/ivquatch** 7. ""elections are all rigged anyway, why play the game when it's fixed?"" over $1,000,000,000.00 will be spent this year on campaign ads and commercials and yard signs, states will pass laws to suppress voter turnout, politicians will spend hours shaking babies and kissing hands all to win, buy, steal or nullify your vote. there are people who will be going to the ends of the earth to convince you to stay home and there are those; like me, who will talk your ear off trying to get you into the voting booth. for a rigged system where the outcome is predetermined a lot of people are spending a lot of time and money on you and on your vote. i'm sure that more excuses will come up in this thread and i'll try to respond to them, but the real point that i want you to take away is this: vote!",none,5

94b9920e-4190-4f5b-a402-1e4f53f1ea15,a perspective of traveling alone,"not sure what my intentions were posting this, but i just felt like blogging a bit about my recent trip. i'm currently in prague and have been in europe for 2.5 months. i started in madrid, took a train to barcelona, flew to porto and took a train to lisbon. after flying to amsterdam, i took trains to rotterdam, utrecht, antwerp, bruges, cologne, baumholder (us military base), nuremburg, and now prague. i've never travelled alone, in europe, or for such a long time. i've spent $2500 and using a 50 liter backpack. i've met so many beautiful people in hostels, some of whom i've developed these fascinating relationships with. i have had genuine opportunities to see all sorts of local things and stay in homes with people from the place i'm visiting. that has been the most amazing part. the willingness of some of these people to let a total stranger from the new york stay in their home and feed them and give me a place to sleep is something i've never considered. anyway, i quit my job 3 months ago and here i am a different individual. not different in the way i look at things, but rather in my development as a young person. i no longer feel obligated, cornered, or strapped down by anything. i consider myself fortunate, lucky, and optimistic. it's a beautiful tragedy, traveling. i'm in awe at where i am, what i'm doing, the people i'm with. it's heartbreaking leaving a place and the people i'm with, knowing i may very well never see them again. i know i have time to see everything, yet i know that i'll never be able to recapture the genuine feeling of experiencing it the first time. i'll never been 25 again if i return. so... i guess it's just important to acknowledge how fortunate and lucky we all are to be doing these things.",none,5

3f3b4f57-689f-48a6-9f93-4657b4c01f00,beyonce is not on michael jackson's level and we should stop trying to force it,"firstly, before the usual comments about being a hater etc etc, beyoncé is a legend in her own right and nobody can take that away from but to say she's anywhere near michael jackson's level is wrong; i'll break down why. this is going to be a very long thread but i really do encourage you to read it all if you have the time &amp;#x200b; firstly we take a look at discography; if we're being totally honest bey has a very poor discography, whilst mj has countless and timless hits, beyonce has two maybe three songs that are iconic (crazy in love, single ladies etc) and even then they are not on the same level as say billie jean or thriller or beat it. i do agree that she has many underrated songs but the fact the doesn't have a song that makes you sit back and think ""this is a timeless classic"" will always be her achilles heel. &amp;#x200b; secondly we take a look at sales. this isn't even a contest really; thriller outsold all of bey's entire discography. bey fans will argue about being in a streaming era, i don't have the exact stats right now but beyonce isn't even the most streamed artist in the world (she's 4th i think, ed sheeran is 1st) so this is not even an argument. &amp;#x200b; thirdly is cultural impact. i won't say much here but if you think bey has had anywhere near the same cultural/social impact as mj then you need to learn your music history. &amp;#x200b; fourth is performing- this is a touchy subject for both mj and bey fans alike. a lot of this is of course subjective so i'll be as fair as i can. i will concede that beyonce is a better live singer- she has amazing breath control and technique. however, bey fans often come out with the old ""mj lip-synced a lot."" this is true only post-1992 when his physical and mental wellbeing went off a cliff, before this he did the bad tour, the victory tour and the triumph tour all live and without any lip sync. as far as i know, beyonce has not done an entire tour without lip syncing or using pre-recorded vocals. next is dancing. michael jackson is one of the greatest dancers of all time. ""all he did was grab his crotch and moonwalk"" i keep hearing people say. he invented moves such as the robot, the lean, he popularised the moonwalk, the spin, the kick. not forgetting the iconic billie jean routine, the thriller dance, the smooth criminal choreography and the dance breaks from the bad and remember the time music videos. beyonce is nowhere near as good of a dancer. i'm going to play devil's advocate here but i think beyonce is a pretty mediocre dancer. from what i've seen she heavily uses choreography and many back-up dancers. i have not seen her do any sort of freestyle dancing- the common rebuttal for this is that she ""wears heels"". janet jackson and tina turner also wear heels and they are much better dancers. so overall i till think michael is the better peformer if you take everything into account. &amp;#x200b; fifth is competition. at his prime, michael jackson had to compete with the likes of prince, stevie wonder, david bowie, madnonna, george michael, elton john etc etc. he outsold all of them and had more #1 hits than any other artist in the 80's. who does beyonce have to compete with? the only ones i can think of are taylor swift and ed sheeran, maybe adele too- all of whom regularly outsell and/or outstream her. if you take beyonce and put her in the 80's i'd wager she would not have the same impact as she does now. however, if you take mj and put him in any era he would likely be a success. why? two reasons, 1- much of his music is timeless already 2- he adapts to the culture; just compare the ""off the wall"" album to the ""bad"" album. they are only 10 years apart but they are vastly different in terms of style and sound. ""off the wall"" was made during the tail-end of the disco era. the whole album has disco and funk elements to it; it is very light and playful, compare this to bad which a much more grittier/serious pop album. &amp;#x200b; sixth is iconic performances. i see a lot of beyonce fans on social media calling ""beychella"" the most iconic musical performance ever- nothing has made me laugh out loud more. do not get me wrong, i watched the whole thing, let me tell you it was amazing, the singing, the dancing, the production all of it was amazing; but was it really that iconic though? michael jackson standing still and doing nothing for 90 seconds at the 1993 superbowl was more iconic- people still talk about this even now, everytime the superbowl is played. imagine that, he literally just stood still and got people talking about it to this day. i may be wrong but i doubt in 20/30 years many people, apart from beyonce fans, will talk about ""beychella"" in the same way. and that's just the superbowl performance, let's not forget the motown 25 performance- arguably one of, if not the, most iconic performances in musical history. &amp;#x200b; seventh is songwriting. beyonce is a very underrated songwriter i cannot lie, but this isn't even a contest. &amp;#x200b; eighth is star power. michael jackson is one of the most famous people in history. not just singers or performers but people. just go onto youtube and see the kind of impact he had in people. beyonce is a star in her own right but nowhere near the level of mj- in fact i'd argue taylor swift or ed sheeran have bigger star power than her as they gross more than her per city as well as more streams/sales (i don't have the data for this but you can just search it up.) &amp;#x200b; \[bit of a sidetrack here but many people say stuff along the lines of ""if beyonce was a man, people would give her the same credit as mj."" bullshit. she gets plenty of credit and rightfully so, gender has nothing to do with this. michael grew up in hardship, endured beating at the hands of his own father, never had a proper childhood as he was thrust into the limelight from age 6, had body image problems as an adolescent, endured actual racism in the 70's and 80's, had to battle vitiligo as well as other health problems in his life, had to endure years of ridicule by the press and on top of that had to go through years of being accused of abusing children, for which they have found 0 (zero) evidence for. beyonce (thankfully) hasn't had to deal with half the shit mj went through but apparently she's more opressed because she's a woman? don't give me all that.\] &amp;#x200b; lastly is depth of song. what i mean by this is the different kind of sensitive topics that each of them covered in their songs. mj sung and wrote about poverty, hardship, police brutality, war, famine, environmental damage and many other topics; he incorporated these into many of his songs as he had a real passion for them. beyonce on the other hand, doesn't really do this- songs like ""girls run the world"" and ""formation"" feel too gimmicky and fake woke, they lack real depth and meaning. &amp;#x200b; &amp;#x200b; &amp;#x200b; &amp;#x200b; &amp;#x200b; overall, it's pretty clear that michael jackson is a level above beyonce in terms of everything really. i know this may feel like a beyonce hate thread to some of you- i promise you this is not, but i am just tired of people disrespecting mj.",none,5

2edd078d-4ba7-4073-a129-8a439d62a44e,the tragic state of dentists in india,"hi everyone, this is the first time i'm posting here. i've been a silent reader for many years. i am here to highlight the tragic state of dentists and other medical professionals in india. the intention is not to rant, but to raise awareness so that the readers can share this perspective with their friends and family, some of whom may want to rethink their plans for a medical career staying in india. my friend is a dental (bds) graduate from the best ranked dental college in the country. after 12th, he joined a good engineering college (tier 2) because of the pressure he faced from his parents, but he was passionate about medicine and managed to get admitted into a bds course after struggling for 1 year in engineering. he is currently a resident doctor at the hospital in his college and treats over 50 patients a day. i admire his stamina and dedication. since his fellowship ends in a few months, he was on the lookout for jobs in the private clinics (govt. clinics don't give jobs these days). after interviewing with some of the most well-known clinic chains, he came to me and shared his misery. **private clinics offer rs. 10000/- a month for 10-12 hours work.** **yes, you read that right. in some clinics, it goes upto rs. 15,000/-. i was shocked to hear these figures. one can earn more by working as a cab-driver in any city.** in most countries, dentists are amongst the highest paid professionals. yet, in india, they have to live on a poverty-level salary. my friend spends more than a few thousands every quarter to buy new tools because they need to be replaced to maintain hygiene standards. he has helped hundreds of patients, including critical cases, overcome their misery. people visit him from villages hundreds of kilometers away. and he gets offered 10000/- a month. **to put that into perspective, a dental clinic charges more than 5000 for a root canal treatment, which takes just 1 day of his time.** when we were discussing the reason for this, he said that the **govts had opened up thousands of unregulated dental and medical colleges, and the graduates from these places don't get any clinical experience. hence, many of them work for free at the clinics.** most clinics don't distinguish between the quality and capability of the doctor- they just want someone with a degree and patient satisfaction is just not a concern**. he said that even mbbs graduates from state universities work for 20k a month in many places.** hearing this, **i am actually sad that we keep saying that there aren't enough doctors, whereas the problem seems to be the total absence of regulation of the industry.** now that the govt is increasing the number of seats and allowing paramedics to work as clinicians, the problem will get worse. already, many dentists work for free and i won't be surprised if in the future you might have to pay to work as a dentist in a clinic. if anyone you know wants to pursue dentistry as a career, or even medicine, please let them know this side of the profession. thank you.",none,5

0fa3d837-5bb0-41a3-b625-e9aee62f6382,my advice on reading proofs in mathematics,"first of all: when reading a proof in maths, it takes time. a lot of time. don't expect to fluidly read through the proofs like you'd read through a textbook on other topics. many beginners are frustrated because they feel stupid for not immediately understanding a proof. this is completely, absolutely normal. so don't stress yourself, and take your time. here is, from experience, my advice for reading proofs in mathematics: -before you start, try to think about the problem yourself for some time. see if you can come up with an idea. then start reading. trust me, you will take a lot more out of that proof if you do this first. you'll see. -while reading, take your time and think about every little step as long as it needs for you to understand it. don't blindly accept anything, not even a little detail. always ask ""why"". only proceed if everything up to this point is clear and seems logical to you. -after reading, take a look at the proof as a whole. where did it start, where did it end up, how did it get there. you have to get the idea of the proof as a whole. and then how to execute it. -now close your eyes and try to go through the whole proof by yourself in your head, or write it down. that's a good test to see if you truly understood it or not. why should you do this? it's often the case that you quickly read through a proof and think to yourself ""ah yes, that seems logical"" with every step. but it's always a lot easier to comprehend the reasoning someone else laid out than to do the reasoning yourself. that's why it's so important to think so deeply about the problem itself, the proof as a whole and every step in detail. otherwise, you won't take much out of it. of course this takes a lot of time. it's not meant to be the most time-efficient way of learning, but the one that shows the best results. so you certainly don't have to do it that way with every proof, but if you're having problems with a certain proof or topic, this will help a lot. if you have any feedback, questions or own advice, feel free to share!",none,5

[some of my favorite photos from that cheers, fellow redditors! some have asked for a link to my blog, but i don't think i should post it here in the main post. i have replied to a few comments with links to my website. find one, i guess. or google: abroad american the american west. i should be pretty high up there. edit2: guys and gals, the outpouring of support, questions, and feedback i have gotten i'm response to this post is absolutely amazing. y'all are very nice people, and i am going to try and get to all the comments that you posted overnight here! thank you! tl;dr: you don't have to go abroad to travel. i went to zion national park last summer. i wrote about it. it's a neat place. you should go.",none,5

6878ca8c-237a-4319-8e90-8f87f61afcde,"to all the people who are depressed, unmotivated and struggling to make it out of bed","i’ve seen a lot more depression posts on here than usual. first of all my dms are open to talk vent or rant. long post but hopefully you’ll find some inspiration at the end of it. i dropped out of engineering myself, you can check my post history to a couple of years or so ago. i dropped out of engineering in my third year at pretty good college. restarted it in my second year when my parents refused to fund any other discipline of education. i did my engineering at a shit private college. i was sad and depressed too and all i did was come home, sleep, pass the day, etc. fast forward to today, i’ve spent a year at top 3 international university after being invited, and i’m heading to estonia for my masters, completely free and even a decent stipend to take care of my expenses there. it was a long journey, but i struggled like the rest of you. to all of you who are depressed, unmotivated and in bed all day, i would recommend doing something as simple as taking a shower. a warm/cold shower (however you prefer) is so underrated and can help you just get ready enough to do do something more, or at least get you out of bed. there have been so many times that my feeling of ‘bleh what a day’ turned around after a shower. cut out the porn and the jerking off. it’s going to push you into a deeper hole without making you realise that it’s happening at all. masturbation is fine, so is porn. just don’t indulge to pass the time is all. small achievements can go a long way. try and learn how to make a nice omelette for yourself. re-arrange your cupboard maybe? re-order your bookshelf? clean the dirt off your shoes? water your plants? any of these is something positive you did for yourself or your household. congratulations. depression is very complicated, so there’s no fix all solution as there are infinite reasons that can lead you to this road. i’m going to try and address those who feel unproductive or feel they can’t do much professionally or education wise: a lot of the times, we get depressed because of conflict in fulfilling what’s expected of us and what we actually want to do, my only advice is this: everyone dies. yes, taking up a job which isn’t mainstream might seem embarrassing in the moment, maybe your parents are upset or worst case disown you. but we’re talking about getting you out of the mindset to take your life or wasting it away. you may push yourself to do something that people/parents or society want but not you, then everyone will die, and you’ll be stuck with your choice for 30-40 years, unhappy. i’d rather you risk 5-7 years of discomfort, take a risk, or start at the bottom somewhere and grow and learn. get beyond the confines of the education system if you suck at it. love life on your own terms. also, it helps no one if you want to be a high paid exec but spend your day binging brooklyn 99 or reruns of big bang theory. either adjust your dreams to your effort or your effort to your dreams. a disconnect will only get you down further. story time: a friend of mine, girl, ran away from her house after she was verbally and physically abused by her family for not getting a job. she was 23 at that time. she had around 19k in savings, walked around and found a job as a night desk attendant after a week in a local chain hotel reception. she managed to find a place to stay with 5 other people in a very (very) small flat, so she could pay less rent, she ate shit food and lived in shit conditions, but she learned and grew on the job, by waiting tables and cleaning and doing additional duties. she grew and now she’s managing the hotel and running a bar owned by the owner of the chain on her own and earning more than most people i know at 27-28. this woman would call me almost everyday depressed and crying, to see her where she is now makes me very happy. so yeah, her family hated her, her relatives hated her for being a receptionist and a dishwasher and a waitress, she risked a lot for 4-5 years, but she decided to work her ass off out of that situation. doing productive work isn’t too hard. you just need some momentum. try and have no zero days. if you’ve got a shit ton of work piled up, resolve to do some portion of it. do enough that the future you (of tomorrow, of next week, of next month) can thank the past you for being an awesome bro/sis and doing your part of the load. so no zero productivity days. feel free to dm. ps: redditors can at the very most sympathise with you and tell you that everything is going to be okay. very few would be more generous than words of support. everyone will move on with their life and in the end, it’s only you and your hustle. solution takes time and you’ll probably be out of the rut, but it’ll take time. be patient.",none,5

a39eee83-fedf-4346-9b91-3ecfd41288bb,"i made a playlist of ""metalheads of reddit, what song would you show someone to prove that not all metal is insane noise and screaming?"" askreddit thread.","ok, i feel like i just completed an epic journey. this evening i completed a 500+ track [spotify of all songs / bands mentioned in the massive [metalheads of reddit, what song would you show someone to prove that not all metal is insane noise and r/askreddit thread by /u/nickthenegative. the good, the bad (drowning pool, slipknot), the ugly (anal cunt (hehe)), within the limitations of spotify availability, from all posts above 7 upvotes, all parent comments and most child comments. i stopped at posts 7 and below because a lot of the posts started repeating suggestions and i got tired. if the posted track was not available due to album not being on spotify i added my favorite jammer from that band, or their top track if i wasn't familiar with them. formatting was by basically top/highest upvoted parent comment first, then it's children, usually 2 or 3 layers down. with this format, similar bands from subgenres are usually clumped together on the playlist. like the highest voted post was /u/exoticcatpoopcoffee being converted to a metalhead by animals as leaders, and a bunch of child posts where related to chon, plini, etc. then the next bunch of tracks will be a bunch of stoner metal tracks, and then a bunch of iron maiden and all the subsequent tracks listed in it's child comments, etc. i didn't put entire albums on the playlist, didn't want people to have to slog through a whole album if there was a jammer or two that got that albums point across, also wanted playlist to flow and have variety like the comments in the original thread did. i think this playlist is a good conversion tool for people interested in the metal genre, lots of varied styles to listen to, and if someone's not digging a track just skip ahead and you'll likely get another totally different genre that may suit you better. the best, and definitely most underappreciated post on the thread was from /u/yeimzhetfield going into what i think the most chronologically appropriate metal genre journey, building on intensity and brutality. he also linked to another fantastic post about [doom from /u/deathofthesun from 4 years ago, that details the highlights of the doom genre decade by decade, which i couldn't help but add to this playlist as a bonus since its now tangentially connected to the main post, and it was brutal as fuck. trends i noticed were: lots of opeth recommendations, with 12 tracks on the playlist. which makes sense because they're a phenomenal band that's pushed the metal genre and their band in a lot of different directions, from death metal to clean vocalled progressive metal to some of their current stuff sounding almost like jazz fusion if you didn't know it was actually an opeth record. great for demonstrating the diversity of the genre, even from one band. lots of iron maiden, 11 tracks on playlist, again, not surprising, classic metal masters but not aggressive so would be easily absorbed by someone new to metal to listen to. lots of stoner (and doom/sludge) metal, which i've noticed usually does pretty well on reddit in general. a lot of devin townsend, which is always nice, 8 tracks including syl. (rip skullet) a heavy amount of ghost, 5 tracks. a pretty good amount of tool recommendations, none of which is on spotify. i can see how tool can definitely be a gateway for some people to progressive metal. a heavy spoonful of mastodon recommendations, which could be potentially controversial. some of the most grievous suggestions i had to leave out, sadly due to spotify availability limitations: [mirror mirror by blind i'd recommend the entire [nightfall on middle album. i've used it to convert a couple fantasy nerds to appreciate metal with it because it's a concept album based on jrr tolkien's silmarillion, and is probably the best power metal album of all time.

[boris - heavy rocks there's several other gems, some power metal that weird record label issues, also the more obscure nwobhm and traditional heavy metal genres that weren't on spotify. tracks this playlist refueled a passion for, which i hadn't heard in a while: [nightwish - and [powerwolf's amen and highlights of bands i'm really digging that this playlist introduced me to or got me to dig further into: sabaton and edguy (i hadn't really listened to them before this playlist, great shit though). satan (nwobhm band, pretty awesome). jeff loomis, holy fucking shit. my contribution to the playlist which i didn't see anyone else mention was [""i was buried at mount pleasant by woods of ypres, it's beautiful. and uriah heep, thanks ma. some bands that have converted friends of mine to become metalheads are blind guardian (as mentioned above, for the fantasy friend). i have a history buff friend that said he liked dethklok a lot, and i told him that music is mimicking / riffing actual bands, so i gave him a good array of metal, and what hooked him was amon amarth, and he got super into the viking metal genre and now knows way more viking metal than i do. i have another bud who saw alestorm randomly at a festival and really liked them a lot, blam, pirate metal. i got my brother into metal with opeth and the death clock armageddon album by dimmu borgir (fun fact: nathan explosion used to work at dimmu burger). even my wife, who usually gets a headache from metal, really likes new opeth a lot. what got me into metal was my parents spoonfeeding me progressive rock from a very young age, and also i went through a phase in very late elementary/early middle school were i got obsessed with classical music (which /u/rajajones recommended in his insightful as well with a [beethoven's 7th recommendation). but this all led me down a road to metal, for years i sought brutality before i know what metal even was. i also think seeing [cannibal corpse in ace ventura pet also helped. so the moral of the story is there's metal for everyone out there, you just have to open up your heart and let the grim hails fill you in just the right places.

fbb447b7-96fb-468b-8d1b-972a32487f51,"talking about real, concrete, simple, everyday things in english... = extremely difficult","... is extremely difficult for non-native speakers like myself. ok, this is an exaggeration, but i will dare to say: the simpler the subject matter, the more difficult it is to talk about it in english. i would do much better job talking about global warming, unemployment statistics, or even big bang theory, than about stuff like fixing my bicycle, a traffic issue that i had, preparing a certain type of meal, or an argument i had with my friends. the reason is simple: in school, at various courses, and even online, we are usually exposed to academic, abstract, or in some other ways intangible english. even in online chatrooms, people are aware that it's difficult to describe physical and other realities of your everyday life to people from other countries who don't have any clue about how it is at your place, so such topics are skipped, in favor of discussions of music, movies, politics, science, economy, or various other global issues that are pretty much the same everywhere and accessible to everyone through media, internet, etc. and now, i see a lot of you saying: so what? it's not a big deal... well, it's not a big deal, until it becomes. it can be a very big deal in certain situations. first, you can seem like an idiot in the simplest possible conversations with native speakers. it's not just a blow to your ego, but can also be an impediment to communication. second, it can make it harder to develop real and deep intimacy and understanding with another person, be it a native speaker, or another non-native speaker. it's not just that we lack vocabulary for describing certain real, physical things... we also lack vocabulary, for describing certain situations, phenomena, institutions, occurences... ways of doing things, everyday procedures, routines, etc... i think most of the english textbooks kind of skip such things... and you rarely encounter them even in online surfing. when it comes to solutions to these problems, i can think of several: 1) reading lots of fiction... the more realistic the better. 2) deliberate study, online research for certain vocabulary, etc... 3) living in english speaking country for some period. 4) writing a diary/journal in your native language for a long time, as detailed as possible. so after a certain perioid, you'll cover most of the vocabulary that you actually use in daily life in your own language. then trying to translate it in english as accurately as possible, with the help of dictionaries... hopefully, by the time, you're done, you should discover the english equivalents for the words you really need and use in daily living. however, rather than just looking for solutions, i'm quite curious about this problem itself. do you experience it too? how much problems/frustration does it cause? have you find your ways of overcoming it? how common is this situation? is it just me, or a lot of people struggle with it?",none,5

6096c60c-e184-48e8-a1a6-14c05f3d0697,5 years in mexico - the nitty gritty,"i'll admit this post is inspired by the current thread asking for safe latin america alternatives to travel to instead of mexico. i'll also admit that i have a vested interest in the international perception of safety in mexico as i own a small business here reliant on tourism. and finally i'll also admit that i take it a little too personally when people wrongly assume mexico is dangerous when it just simply isn't true. i understand ""how"" the misconception came to be but it's still frustrating. i'm 100% gringo but it still gets my goat. i was just home for my 20 year high school reunion and it was insane some of the questions i had to field from otherwise reasonable, intelligent people. anyhow, if you're interested here is a 100% honest account of our experience living in mexico over the past 5 years. for the record by no means am i saying it's like this everywhere in the country, mexico is a huge place and while i've traveled quite a bit of it, i've only ever spent extended time here on the coast of oaxaca. i am not going to cite statistics or studies. this information is from my own personal experience/perception only. **narcos** unless you're getting involved in the drug trade there is zero chance you'll have a problem with a drug dealer. realistically if all you're doing is ""buying"" drugs you'll be fine, too. it is only those who sell drugs that are putting themselves into danger. edit: let me clarify that i don't buy drugs...i am speaking generally here. but to be fair you can't sell drugs anywhere in the world without worrying about stepping on someone else's toes. (not that i have ever been employed in this trade.) i'll admit that there's a murder or two every year in this area related to drug dealers. it's always one drug dealer killing another. this isn't a positive thing - but it's hardly a mexico-centric occurrence. by the way, i am talking about local drug dealers, not cartels. contrary to what the movies say, the entire country isn't one giant cartel. **murder** there are more murders here than in your living room for sure. what the stats don't tell you is that most non gang on gang murders are between family members. if your uncle is mexican and you plan on coming to dispute the deed on 10 hectares of farmland you might get murdered...by your uncle...if you are here to drink margaritas and get sand in your crack you will not get murdered. not long after we arrived here a box with a severed head was found on the beach in town...inside was a note...it said ""this is what happens to child rapists in puerto escondido""...i've also been told by numerous people that ""rateros"" or thieves have a way of just ""disappearing."" yes, mexican culture involves quite a bit of vigilante behavior. they even kill criminals that the police don't prosecute. don't rape kids and don't habitually steal shit and you won't be in any danger. mexican culture in terms of disputes does allow for things to escalate to violence more quickly than at home...this i will admit...but these scenarios just don't come into play when you're on vacation. **petty crime** wander a dark beach at 3am wasted and you might get your wallet stolen. this can happen in california or florida, too. wander the beach at 3pm and someone will try to sell you a hammock or chile peanuts. last week i accidentally left a shovel out when i was working on the trail to the beach. the next day my shovel was gone. this is the first instance of something like this happening in 5 years. we also got ripped off once during construction when the gravel guy lied about the price of sand (for concrete) going up...he hosed us for an extra 10 bucks per dumptruck and so we then found a different guy. that's about the extent of the thievery we've personally experienced here. **the people** mexicans are seriously some of the kindest, generous, hard-working people you'll ever meet. yeah, they are always trying to rip each other off a little bit but if they try to ""get you"" it's not because you're a foreigner...they'd jack the price up for their own grandma if they could get away with it. **corruption** there is plenty of corruption here. right now there's a new park in town that has halted construction because one of the mayor's buddies stole all the money. you can certainly grease pockets here and skirt the rules if you wish...but it's also organized enough that you don't have to. we have been here 5 years and haven't paid a single bribe to anyone. not even once. so the corruption is starting to be improved upon, at least to the extent that you have the option of doing things by the books if you please. **danger** there are two things to be scared of here. the ocean &amp; drunk drivers. every year a tourist drowns here...either a surfer going out into dangerous waves or someone too drunk to be going into the ocean. drunk driving is a real problem here. the reason to avoid driving at night is not banditos, it's drunk drivers. **safety** it's safe here. it really honestly and truly is. and really when you start to look at the odds of something bad happening to you the difference statistically between it happening in mexico versus home, we're talking about pretty negligible numbers. i love living here and all of the complaints that i do have about the country (and i have plenty) have nothing to do with danger and criminals. i don't like the general attitude towards and treatment of animals. i don't like the backwards and unfair education system. i don't like the rich taking advantage of the poor. i don't like the racism/classism (upper class mexicans often look at the poor/indigenous like dirt). i don't like the way women are portrayed/treated by the lower/working class. i don't like littering. i get frustrated that people making $500/month have a $500 phone. i get frustrated that the lower classes will find any excuse to miss work (they work hard when there but will miss the whole day for a 1 hour commitment). i get frustrated by a high level of belief in superstition (particularly in oaxaca). but i'm not scared to be here. mexico's not a dangerous country. edit: just to address conflicting opinions all at once here...i am not saying mexico is as safe as the developed world. it's not. and if you wish to travel outside of the generally frequented tourist routes (particularly in the border zone) you will need to take more precaution. but let's not pretend that we all live in crime-free countries and that we're exempt from danger at home. my point is that the extent to which mexico is more dangerous than your home town is small enough that this small increase in risk should not stop you from travelling here. there is danger everywhere in the world and your behavior tends to dictate your safety wherever you are at...truly ""random"" crime is still pretty rare in even the most messed up places.",none,5

[1,2,3] on the one hand, some people argue, that it is a too risky job. they claim, that you are not earning immediately much money and that you have a higher chance to go bankrupt than to be successful. it is true that it’s not a stable job and that you are not going to be successful immediately, but many authors had side jobs and then got famous after writing several years. j. r. r. tolkien for example worked as a professor for many years and it took more than two years to become successful. many authors do the same thing. they have a normal nine to five job and write the books in their free time and according to a survey it is more important to the most people to be happy than to have much money. [4,5,6] furthermore, these people often consider it to be a hard job, because it is very difficult to become successful. while it is true that some authors never become successful, many of them gave up because they didn’t receive good feedback. when you start writing you often make mistakes and are not able to write masterpieces, but the feedback is the part which you can grow on. if you read the reviews you can improve yourself and chat with the critics online, thus learning how to write good books and become successful. on the other hand, you write beautiful stories. in the fantasy genre you create for example big mysterious worlds with invented creatures and you write stories about them and their history. j. r. r. tolkien, for instance, worked 56 years on the silmarillion, the history book with myths and tales explaining the history and creation of middle-earth and didn’t even finish it, because he died. these worlds can suck you in and let you write for hours without you even realising that it is not noon anymore, but already 2 a.m. [4] finally, you are your own boss, thus meaning you can decide what to you want to do. you can decide to write a thriller on one day and then on another day you can decide to write a romance. if you have a writer’s block, you can just take a break. you can stop and continue whenever you want. besides some people hate going to sleep at 11 p.m. and waking up at 6 a.m. you could just wake later up as an author and sleep how you want. most people have to adapt their sleeping times and other activities to their job, but as a self-employed person could adapt your “working times” to your activities and preferences. after considering all arguments i conclude, that even tough there are some financial risks the arguments speaking for it outweigh the ones speaking against it. with the ability to manage your time on your own and the worlds you can yourself in to, it is very reasonable to call it the best job. that’s why when graduate i want to be an author. thank you, for reading this through references: [1] , 11.09.2019, 6:34 p.m. [2] ever_b_57ab4b34e4b08c46f0e47130 , 11.09.2019, 6:35 p.m. [3] , 11.09.2018, 6:38 p.m. [4] , 11.09.2019, 7:00 p.m. [5] , 11.09.2019, 7:00 p.m. [6] , 11.09.2019, 7:41 p.m.",none,5

78a047a7-cfc2-4b08-ba24-b5a8a018bebd,very important piece of advice regarding the trans siberian train,"hi all i recently took the trans siberian train (technically the trans mongolian train) from beijing to moscow. it was my second time doing this journey. i can give general advice, but i wanted to pass on this very important piece of advice: when the train arrives in a random russian (or mongolian or chinese) station, the train attendants will tell you how much time you have at the station. **this information is not accurate**. the train attendants do not know when the train will leave the station. this is entirely up to the station manager. he will radio the train driver and tell him when to leave. i, and many others, have fallen victim to this. we arrived at a random station (total middle of nowhere) in russia, and my carriages attendant said we have 25 minutes. as i got off the train, i met a group of chinese people who were told we have 40 minutes. so i go to the shop in the station, buy some water, and return 5 minutes later. **the train had left**. by absolute luck, i had a few hundred usd in my pocket, but nothing else. no wallet, no passport, no phone, no watch, no laptop... luckily i knew the name of the next station (400 km away) so i was able to get a taxi for 6 hours to the station. 20 minutes after arriving, the train pulled in. to understand how much of a close call this was, for the entire journey we drove through red lights and skipped huge traffic queues by driving on grass, etc. a complete mad journey, the type where people die in a car crash. the chinese people i met at the previous station (who i couldn't find when i was getting my taxi) never made the train. they were stranded in some random tiny russian town. couple of things to note here: 1. the chinese attendants on the train didn't give a shit. 2. the staff in the russian train station told me to go to a different train station. if i had to followed their advice i would have missed the train. if you plan to take the trans siberian train, you need to make sure of the following: 1. if you get off the train, even if the attendants say you have an hour, do not leave the side of the train. it is just not worth it. 2. every time you get off the train, make sure you bring a bag containing your passport, wallet, phone, charger, adaptor. it is very tempting to run into the station to buy some water or food, but its just not worth it. thinking back at my experience, if i had of missed my train, i don't know what i would have done. i didn't have enough money on my to pay the taxi ($600), and both stations weren't even villages. so i guess i would have had to go to the police station, contact the embassy, and hope they could wire money for the taxi. maybe i would sleep in the police station until the embassy could send me a new passport? i have no idea. fucking nightmare. i can answer any other questions you might have.",none,5

0aaab11e-7efd-43ca-b11e-78609672196c,science discussion series: the importance of sample size in science and how to talk about sample size.,"**summary:** most laymen readers of research do not actually understand what constitutes a proper sample size for a given research question and therefore often fail to fully appreciate the limitations or importance of a study's findings. this discussion aims to simply explain what a sample size is, the consequence of too big or too small sample sizes for a given research question, and how sample size is often discussed with respect to evaluating the validity of research without being too technical or mathematical. ___ it should already be obvious that very few scientific studies sample whole population of individuals without considerable effort and money involved. if we could do that and have no errors in our estimations (e.g., like counting beads in a jar), we would have no uncertainty in the conclusions barring dishonesty in the measurements. the true values are in front of you for to analyze and no intensive data methods needed. this rarely is the case however and instead, many theatres of research rely on obtaining a sample of the population, which we define as the portion of the population that we actually can measure. **defining the sample size** one of the fundamental tenets of scientific research is that a good study has a good-sized sample, or multiple samples, to draw data from. thus, i believe that perhaps one of the first criticisms of scientific research starts with the sample size. i define the sample size, for practical reasons, as the number of individual sampling units contained within the sample (or each sample if multiple). the sampling unit, then, is defined as that unit from which a measurement is obtained. a sampling unit can be as simple as an individual, or it can be a group of individuals (in this case each individual is called a sub-sampling unit). with that in mind, let's put forward and talk about the idea that a proper sample size for a study is that which contains enough sampling units to appropriately address the question involved. an important note: sample size should not be confused with the number of replicates. at times, they can be equivalent with respect to the design of a study, but they fundamentally mean different things. **the random sample** but what actually constitutes an appropriate sample size? ideally, the best sample size is the population, but again we do not have the money or time to sample every single individual. but it would be great if we could take some piece of the population that correctly captures the variability among everybody, in the correct proportions, so that the sample reflects that which we would find in the population. we call such a sample the “perfectly random sample”. technically speaking, a perfect random sample accurately reflects the variability in the population regardless of sample size. thus, a perfect random sample with a size of 1 unit could, theoretically, represent the entire population. but, that would only occur if every unit was essentially equivalent (no variability at all between units). if there is variability among units within a population, then the size of the perfectly random sample must obviously be greater than 1. thus, one point of the unending discussion is focused on what sample size would be virtually equivalent to that of a perfectly random sample. for intuitive reasons, we often look to sample as many units as possible. but, there’s a catch: sample sizes can be either too small or, paradoxically, too large for a given question (sandelowski 1995). when the sample size is too small, redundancy of information becomes questionable. this means that the estimates obtained from the sample(s) do not reliably converge on the true value. there is a lot of variability that exceeds that which we would expect from the population. it is this problem that’s most common among the literature, but also one that most people cling to if a study conflicts with their beliefs about the true value. on the other hand, if the sample size is too large, the variability among units is small and individual variability (which may be the actual point of investigation) becomes muted by the overall sample variability. in other words, the sample size reflects the behavior and variability of the whole collective, not of the behavior of individual units. finally, whether or not the population is actually important needs to be considered. some questions are not at all interested in population variability. it should now be more clear why, for many research questions, the sample size should be that which addresses the questions of the experiment. some studies need more than 400 units, and others may not need more than 10. but some may say that to prevent arbitrariness, there needs to be some methodology or protocol which helps us determine an optimal sample size to draw data from, one which most approximates the perfectly random sample and also meets the question of the experiment. many types of analyses have been devised to tackle this question. so-called power analysis (cohen 1992) is one type which takes into account effect size (magnitude of the differences between treatments) and other statistical criteria (especially the significance level, alpha [usually 0.05]) to calculate the optimal sample size. others also exist (e.g., bayesian methods and confidence intervals, see lenth 2001) which may be used depending on the level resolution required by the researcher. but these analyses only provide numbers and therefore have one very contentious drawback: they do not tell you how to draw the sample. **discussing sample size** based on my experiences with discussing research with folks, the question of sample size tends not to concern the number of units within a sample or across multiple samples. in fact, most people who pose this argument, specifically to dismiss research results, are really arguing against how the researchers drew their sample. as a result of this conflation, popular media and public skeptics fail to appreciate the real meanings of the conclusions of the research. i chalk this up to a lack of formal training in science and pre-existing personal biases surrounding real world perceptions and experiences. but i also think that it is nonetheless a critical job for scientists and other practitioners to clearly communicate the justification for the sample obtained, and the power of their inference given the sample size. i end the discussion with a point: most immediate dismissals of research come from people who associate the goal of the study with attempting to extrapolate its findings to the world picture. not much research aims to do this. in fact, most don’t because the criteria for generalizability becomes much stronger and more rigorous at larger and larger study scales. much research today is focused on establishing new frontiers, ideas, and theories so many studies tend to be first in their field. thus, many of these foundational studies usually have too small sample sizes to begin with. this is absolutely fine for the purpose of communication of novel findings and ideas. science can then replicate and repeat these studies with larger sample sizes to see if they hold. but, the unfortunate status of replicability is a topic for another discussion. *some sources* lenth 2001 cohen 1992 sandelowski 1995 ____ an example of too big of a sample size for a question of interest. a local ice cream franchise is well known for their two homemade flavors, serious vanilla and whacky chocolate. the owner wants to make sure all 7 of his parlors have enough ice cream of both flavors to satisfy his customers, but also just enough of each flavor so that neither one sits in the freezer for too long. however, he is not sure which flavor is more popular and thus which flavor there should be more of. let’s assume he successfully surveys every person in the entire city for their preference (sample size = the number of residents of the city) and finds out that 15% of the sample prefers serious vanilla, and 85% loves whacky chocolate. therefore, he decides to stock more whacky chocolate at all of his ice cream parlors than serious vanilla. however, three months later he notices that 3 of the 7 franchises are not selling all of their whacky chocolate in a timely manner and instead serious vanilla is selling out too quickly. he thinks for a minute and realizes he assumed that the preferences of the whole population also reflected the preferences of the residents living near his parlors which appeared to be incorrect. thus, he instead groups the samples into 7 distinct clusters, decreasing the sample size from the total number of residents to a sample size of 7, each unit representing a neighborhood around the parlor. he now found that 3 of the clusters preferred serious vanilla whereas the other 4 preferred whacky chocolate. just to be sure of the trustworthiness of the results, the owner also looked at how consistently people preferred the winning flavor. he saw that within 5 of the 7 clusters, there was very little variability in flavor preference meaning he could reliably stock more of one type of ice cream, but 2 of the parlors showed great variability, indicating he should consider stocking equitable amounts of ice cream at those parlors to be safe.",none,5

of which $201,700 came from the gsa and $21,939 came from ark public employees retirement. the income from these sources alone would place them in the top 99th percentile of americans. here's their primary sources of income claimed in 2014: * bill made $9,730,000 in speaking fees and $6,153,920 as a consultant. * hillary made $10,492,000 in speaking fees and $5,563,867 from being an author (she filed 2 separate schedule c's;

06168988-365d-4953-951f-1308998ef0ea,"how to save for a big trip (1 year+) - people were asking me, so here's some tips.","so a few people were asking how we saved up to take a 1 year+ honeymoon travelling the world. thought i’d put down a list and people can add to it with their tips. that way, if anyone searches they will come across this post. as a caveat, we aren’t rich, we don’t have rich parents no one gave us a huge wad of cash to go travelling with and we literally started with nothing. it took us 2 years to save the money, including money for a fairly big wedding as well – big to us, some of you americans spend ridiculous amounts on weddings. to be totally open for this post. we saved up gbp 45,000 over 2 years. 20k went on the wedding, 3k went on booking flights and the remaining 20k we spent travelling the world (and we even came back with a little to survive on!). when i say we i mean 2 people. i did a post about our budget a while back which you can search. just before i start as well. this isn’t easy. it takes a lot of will power and sacrifice to get to these kind of saving levels. obviously if you don’t want to save as much then you can cut corners etc. etc. but if you want to travel for a long period then here you go: but this is what we did: 1. set a target. time and cash amount. be realistic. i.e. you’re never going to save 100% of your salary! ever… and unless you earn a shitload then you aren’t going to save 45k in 6 months either…. 2. stick to those targets and incentivise yourself. we booked our flights halfway through our saving period and that made us cut down even more. the fact we knew we were going, strengthened our resolve and made us really knuckle down. 3. have a look at what things cost where you are going. say you read budget guides that say you can travel on 15 dollars a day in asia. then use that knowledge – if you go to a bar with mates, think to yourself, “that’s probably a whole extra week’s travelling i could be doing instead of having a generic night out that’s going to leave me feeling like shit tomorrow!” 4. on to the nitty gritty: cut down all of your monthly direct debits – it’s pretty obvious, but the less you have going out of the account then the more you can save – direct debits are a fucker, you don’t notice them going out and they are trickier to track than cash. so that mean’s cancel your gym, your sky tv (cable for the americans), your spotify, your netflix – it’s really tough but you just don’t need these things. read books from the library, go for walks, get running for free in the roads to keep fit, etc. etc. 5. cut that phone bill down. we didn’t upgrade our phones, we went on to those sim only contracts for a fiver a month each. you really don’t need a brand new iphone when you’re sunning yourself on a beach in the philippines. this saves you so much money it’s ridiculous. over 24 months we saved £1500 just by cutting our phone bills down to basically nothing a month 6. pay off your debts. it might seem counterintuitive to be putting your savings towards credit card bills etc. but you save so much money in the long term and that’s what we’re talking about here. 7. food – you don’t need to buy lunch or eat out every day. make lunches for work, cook everything yourself. each week i bought myself a chicken (or lamb/pork to mix things up) and cooked it for the whole week’s lunches. split that into 5 and had a bit of veg and salad with it. healthy and so cheap. alternatively cook big meals in the evening and have “left overs” for lunch the next day. also, instead of meeting your friends for dinner at restaurants, go to a house and have a dinner party instead. 8. transport – obviously this isn’t going to apply to everyone, but we bought ourselves a bike each and cycled 8 miles each way, each day to work. this alone saved us nearly gbp 6,000!!!! if you have a car that you don’t absolutely 100% need then get rid of it. they cost a fortune! or if you have a car on finance then sell it and get a cheaper car for a year. 9. get a second job – my wife got a saturday morning job every other week taking people round houses for an estate agent. an extra 50 quid a week which definitely adds up! 10. quit snacking/smoking/drinking – these are things we spend so much money on. choccy bar here, pack of cigs there, 8 pints on a thursday after work. this is where it starts to get really tough but if your serious then it can be done. obviously everyone falls off the wagon once in a while though!! 11. move in with friends/parents – the ultimate cash save. for one year we moved out of our lovely london apartment and back into a house share. we cut our rent down to a third of what we were paying and we cut our bills into a quarter of what we were paying. an absolute no brainer. or if you have a spare room then rent that out. 12. sell everything you can. you will be amazed what people buy. chuck it all on ebay, i even sold my playstation and golf clubs (that was a tough day!). all that other crap that you have lying around, take it to a car boot sale (do you have those in america?) – we made about £400 from selling stuff that honestly should have just gone straight in a bin. some girl bought my wife’s old sandals because she said they looked vintage…they were the grossest things i’ve ever seen. 13. finally, for the honeymooners (until i think of more of if anyone else gives me more things), don’t ask for wedding presents. ask for money towards your trip. some people get a bit awkward giving money for weddings (grandma!) so put things like a new camera on there, or your backpacks, hammocks, flip flops etc. etc. stuff you will be buying anyway. 14. thought of another one we did. we did everything we could, ourselves. haircuts? got my wife to cut mine and a friend to do hers. things broke, we would fix them instead of buying new/getting repaired. food shop - go do it instead of getting it delivered. these simple things all add up. keep a track of everything. i made a spreadsheet of in/out cash flows and we were literally penny pinching but we did it. and it was the best decision we ever made.",none,5

c735001e-4712-4082-9d88-1b8af3258aa4,how to make the trip you saved for last long [1 yr +] [related to the savings post],"so after reading /u/clownfeet 's great post about saving for travel i felt like that thread needed some expanding. because all your hard earned cash is going to run out fast if you don't know how to spend it! i feel like a lot of people don't fully grasp that travel can be very cheap, if you do it right... just as saving can be very easy, if you have the proper motivation (and you are born in the right country :/ ) just like /u/clownsfeet, we saved about 16.000 euros per person to travel. this took us little over one year. we worked hard, at nights, in weekends. it was not fun. we skipped bar nights, fancy clothes, and followed a lot of the advice lined out in his post. we found this to be very easy though. you just have to *really* want to travel! we left 5 months ago and spent roughtly 5000 per person until now. the first two months we spent in a motorhome in the us and canada. this was the most expensive part of the trip, and not a typical backpacker destination (worth it though!!) then we flew to costa rica, and spent about 3 months in central/south america. the plan is to make our way south, to bolivia, and fly to nz/aus in february. by calculation we will still have 6k each left by then. our plan is to find a job, and just save like we did at home. after that: back to asia, or whatever. we'll see. this is not our first big trip, so we're leaving it kind of open ended. anyway, here are my moneysaving/travel prolonging tips. 1. find your level of comfort. i cannot do this for you, but suffice to say: don't treat your trip like a regular vacation. it's going to be less luxurious, more hectic, and so on, if you want it to last long. that, or you're loaded. if you are not ready for this, don't go all in and fly straight to india to find the cheapest hostel in the country. give yourself some time, and slowly start experimenting with cheaper backpacker options. 2. before leaving, try to find out how to save on food, accommodation and transportation in the countries you are visiting. this can differ greatly between 'western' and 'less western' countries. for example: in the usa, we ended up traveling relatively cheap and careless by renting a motorhome (especially cheap with friends/family to share it with), cooking our own dinners and driving everywhere by ourselves. right now, in colombia, it is almost just as cheap to go to a restaurant, busses and hostels are inexpensive, and many prices are negotiable. same goes for big parts of asia, of course. in europe, it's probably cheaper to cook your own food, and travel by bus/ryanair instead of car. it's a completely different everywhere. figure out what is the best for each country and budget your trip accordingly. 3. save just like you would before you left. skip on expensive bar nights with people in the hostel, fancy cocktails or restaurants. beer will become a big part of your budget if you don't keep an eye on this. 4. find a cheap way of communicating. either a local sim, or skype credit+wifi... it will save you a lot of cash. use it to buy your mom a smartphone so you can im her too! 5. sometimes less is more. the desire to see everything can be overwhelming and will cost you a lot of money on transportation. sometimes, i like it better to be in one place for 10 days than in 5 places for 2 days. it is cheaper, and it gives you the time to really get to know a place. 6. volunteering. please be careful with this one. i've met a lot of people who've paid a lot of money (like 1000 bucks a month) to teach english, work on a farm, or count some animals in the jungle. don't be this guy/girl! you will arrive there, and right away you'll notice a lot of people are doing the same for just food costs (like $3 a day), for free, or are even getting paid. check helpx and workaway.info. volunteering is also fun, and a good way to have some routine after a long time of travelling. 7. make friends with the locals, talk to people. not only is it fun, they will show you all kinds of awesome shit that you would otherwise pay a guide for. 8. make money on the road. i have no experience with this, but especially teachers, text writers and diving instructors seem to be very lucky in being able to work nearly anywhere. also check upwork. on a sidenote: i have received quite some donations for birthdays, anniversaries and other holidays. don't be afraid to ask for a small donation when your family back home is buying each other christmas gifts! 9. think really well about the things you want to do. when we were in costa rica, everyone was complaining that it was so expensive there. and sure, it is, but do you really want to do all the adrenaline, coffee and chocolate tours in the country? is that going to be the highlight of your once in a lifetime rtw trip? we spent only 27 eur a day there, all in. personally, i don't give a shit about ziplining or bungee, and i will do my coffee tour in colombia for 15% of the price. 10. this may sound weird, but don't lie to yourself. a lot of times, you want something to be cheap, so in your mind you will tell yourself that it actually is going to be/was cheap, by omitting certain costs from your calculations. chances are, you probably spent more. ever met that guy who has been travelling 'for only 18 dollars a day in [x]'? he's probably full of shit, or he has been missing out on a lot of awesome stuff! (disclaimer: it is very well possible to travel on this budget in many places. this is just an example.) 11. we all fuck up, get ripped off, have to take an expensive taxi every now and then. don't beat yourself up over it. some days you will go over budget, sometimes you will stay well below it. staying on budget is not defined by incidents but by trends. think ahead, stay real, and don't get frustrated over money. sometimes it's better to go home a bit sooner and have more fun :) well, sorry for the wall of text, but hopefully this helps someone. please add tips, or correct me if i'm wrong :)",none,5

64e65c1d-ff61-43d7-9be3-6a09908a09eb,people asking if they can travel for months with minimal savings.,"i've seen a few people asking if they can travel for a long time with next to no money. i thought i'd write a few quick things you need to consider. &amp;nbsp; example of the types of questions people often wonder: i want to backpack through x country for 6 months. i only have $2000us can i do it? or what's the longest i can travel for with only $1000? &amp;nbsp; **tl;dr** yes, you can travel as long as you like with minimal money but you have to be prepared to make more sacrifices. &amp;nbsp; disclaimer this is aimed at people wanting to travel on a really really low budget. now, i'm not here to say you can't travel for 2 years with $1200 but i just want to point out some realities. firstly, travelling on a super low budget isn't bad or wrong it's simply a style of traveling. if you're passionate about doing it, have done the research and understand whats involved i'm sure you will have the adventure of a lifetime and should definitely go for it. keep these harsh realities in mind though: **high cost experiences** *traveling is all about your experiences and meeting people, and some of those experiences cost money. you will have to decide what is really worth your money rather than doing / seeing what you actually want. the realities are you basically won't be able to do anything from this top category on your trip.* - helicopter / plane / boat tours - skydiving, paragliding, bungee jumping, - nature safaris, whale watching, - skiing, dogsledding - quad biking, dune buggies - horseriding **low-mid range experiences** *so many famous tourist attractions cost over $20 if you don't just want to just look from the outside. did you come half way around the world to edingburgh and can't afford to see the castle? you're in san francisco but can't go to alcatraz? you get my gist.* - museums - lots of famous museums are really expensive. - hop-on-hop-off buses - tours - entry to national parks - ropes courses - a theatre / show - snorkling - kayaking - nightclub entry - bike rentals - cable cars - breweries / wineries **accommodation** *you will have to be prepared to sleep anywhere.* - couchsurf, park benches, stangers you meet, shitty hostels. - a hostel bed in a half-decent place in the city centre might be $20 or pay $11 for one 30 minutes away in a place rated 23%. you have to be prepared to choose the cheap option. **transport** - 3 days hitchhiking for $0, a 17 hour bus for $25, or 2hr flight for $45. that can be a tough call to make. - buses / metro around the city $2 one way - that's gonna add up. better walk 2 hours. - you can't rent a car or campervan - you can't take a taxi or uber - airport shuttle buses and trains are expensive - there's a bus that leaves at 9am for $14 or one that leaves at 4am for $9. hope you like early mornings. **food and drink** *so many places have amazing local dishes and beers / wines. you're eating noodles and rice. every. single. night...* - no proper meat: no steaks, no fresh fish, - no gourmet take out eg chipotle. you only get cheeseburgers at best - you can't buy bottled water during the day for $2 you need to byo. **social** - it's pub crawl at your hostel, great way to meet people. you're drinking tap water and being that guy that scabs beers. - some friends you've made are all going to the guiness storehouse tomorrow, you're googling pictures of guiness. - you want to go to the nightclub everyone's going to and it's 2 for 1 happy hour. you can't even afford the $10 to get in. - one big night of drinking and partying can easily cost you 10% of your entire travel funds. - your new friends are off to florence for a few days but the transport and the hostel is far too much, you can't go. **gifts / souvenirs** - see an awesome new t-shirt. nope - found the perfect gift for your mum at home. nope **other random costs you have to avoid** - can't afford hostel laundry or a laundromat you have to wash everything by hand - atm fees can be like $3 (thats enough pasta for a week) - toilets can cost $1. watcha gonna do when you're desperate. - be careful when riding the metro with no ticket, if you get fined that basically ends your trip. - if you get robbed it hurts you so much more (plus you probably dont have travel insurance) - weather can suck so much more. harder to hitchhike when its pouring rain for 3 days. - getting sick can crush your expenses - what will life be like when you get back from traveling and have $0 please take all of this with a grain of salt. i didn't want to come accross all negative and crush your dreams. there is absolutely nothing wrong with traveling for a long time with a small budget. i have heard stories about people who have had the most incredible trips with spending next to nothing. some argue it's even better. every country is different and some are cheaper and some are more expensive. like any trip you have to think about what you want to get out of it and what you want your money to go towards. just remember every trip is different and you will have fun no matter what you choose :) edit: formatting",none,5

e5550a66-043c-4a5d-98ad-0c1f3176ae00,how to build your own vocabulary app (with just a google account),"every self-respecting english learner should have a place where they keep vocabulary, expressions, useful phrases. here’s our guide to how you can create your own app with zero knowledge of coding, and just a google account. writing words down and coming back to them is one of the key parts of language learning. if you aren’t doing this then you are missing out on one of the best ways of actually remembering phrases, vocabulary, and expressions. so why not have your own, fully customised, vocabulary app on your phone? this guide will teach you how to create your own bespoke vocabulary app. it requires zero knowledge of coding, costs nothing, and can take you less than 5 minutes to build and get up and running. if we’re counting, you can actually get it set up in 15 seconds (honestly, we’ve even added a video at the end of this guide in case you didn’t believe it). it works on android, iphone, and any phone browser. here’s what you will need: * 5 minutes * a laptop (just to make the app, then afterwards everything will run on your mobile) * a google account (e.g. gmail) * a glide account (very simple to set up and free, we’ll show you how) you’ll be able to build a vocabulary app, personalised to you, that runs only from a google sheet. it’ll be accessible 24/7 on your phone, will be customizable to your needs, and will mean that you can note down any word or phrase you hear and test yourself on it later. here’s how it works. it uses something called glide, which is a really cool tool to allow you to build apps in 60 seconds. and it’s free. you need to head to [this (note, if you want to copy the app, you’ll need to go to that link on a laptop/desktop. on mobile you will just get the app itself). then click 'copy this app' this will ask you to sign up for glide (using your google account), and will make a copy of the entire app and the spreadsheet that it runs from. the spreadsheet will live in your own google drive, and so once you have made a copy of the app, it’s yours. you can view and edit the sheet by clicking on ‘edit sheet’ in glide. you don’t need to worry about manually making a copy of the google sheet, as this happens automatically when you copy the app. think of this spreadsheet as a database of where all your vocabulary will live. you won’t need to edit it directly, but it’s where all of your vocabulary is stored. ok, so if you have got this far, give yourself a little pat on the back. that’s actually it, you now have your own completely customisable vocabulary app. see, we told you that really wouldn’t take long. now, we’ll go into how the app actually works, and how you can customize it. the app has 4 tabs #### 1. my words this tab shows all of your words, regardless of whether you have marked them as ‘remembered’ or not. it is sorted by the date that the word was added, but you can change this yourself. you can tap on any of them to get to the definition of the word. the definition is pulled straight from google translate (so you don’t need to add it manually). each word has a ‘notes’ option, so you can add your own personal notes to the word. you might want to leave yourself a note on how you first heard it, or some uses of that word or phrase in a sentence. you can write whatever you want in there. you can edit everything at any time, so don’t worry too much if you need to change something, or add in more text later. each word has the option to mark it as ‘remembered’, and also to mark it as a ‘favourite’. this is how i use it: mark words as remembered when you are confident that you now remember them. this means that they won’t come up in the list of ‘new words’ that you can use to test yourself. mark words as ‘favourite’ when you want to keep them handy to use in conversation or writing. this is a useful way of keeping track of words that you like, or that you want to practice. marking words as ‘favourite’ requires you to login, but this is very easy - you will be prompted to do so within the app, and then your ‘favourite’ words will come up as an option in the ‘my words’ tab. #### 2. new words this is exactly like ‘my words’, but just shows all of the words that are not marked as ‘remembered’. as you add more and more words, the ‘my words’ tab will get longer and longer, and so this tab will come in handy to help categorise things. #### 3. reverse this tab is exactly like ‘my words’, but instead of showing you the definition in language 1 (english, in this example), it shows you the definition in language 2. for example, ‘my words’ would show ‘dog’, and tapping on it would reveal the translation (in spanish, in this example), which is ‘perro’. the ‘reverse’ tab just shows ‘perro’, and tapping on it would reveal ‘dog’. any language student worth their salt knows that it’s important to be able to go both ways, and so this tab allows you to check you can. #### 4. notes this is a section for you to add specific note relating to phrases, expressions etc. this is different to the ‘my words’ page, as it’s intended for you to add longer expressions. as the vocabulary in ‘my words’ is automatically translated by google translate, the ‘notes’ section here allows for longer expressions. it isn’t automatically translated. for english learners, this would be a good place to add rules about things like your beloved phrasal verbs, turns of phrase, slang, and things that are a little more complicated than just a word and its translation. #### adding your own words to start off, you should delete the words that are in the copied version of the app. these are just examples to show you how it can work. you can delete them by selecting a word, tapping ‘edit’, then ‘delete item’. easy. you can then just add a new word every time that you come across one. add the wording a word is easy, you just tap on the ‘+’ sign on the top right. when you are adding a new word you can also add a note, if you would like to do that. it’s not required, and you can come back to that afterwards. and that’s it. the translation will be done automatically by the google sheet. as will the ‘date added’. if you’re not a spanish speaker learning english, then you will also want to change the language options in there. this is really easy. “language learning” is the language you are trying to learn. “mother tongue” is the language that you want the definition to be in. in terms of actually using the app, there are a few ways you can access it. on the browser (requires an internet connection). you can customise the url on the ‘share’ tab. then you can just access the app through that url (note, anyone else can access it as well, unless you change the privacy settings). while it’s possible to continue to access it only in your browser, you can actually ‘convert it’ to an app with just a couple of taps. see [the instructions from glide on how to do this. personally, this is what i’d recommend, as it will work exactly like any other app on your phone, and mean it’s just a tap away for whenever you need it. and that’s it! while it may, on one level, seem like a basic vocabulary app, it has everything that you **actually need** in there. the best bit? it’s completely customisable. this is just one set-up of the app. you can add more tabs, you can customise it to be however you want it. it’s completely up to you, but here are some of the ways you might want to customise it: * you could categorise each piece of vocabulary using the [choice * you could add additional languages to the app (if you are learning multiple languages). * you could add images and video to show how these words and phrases are used by native speakers * you could embed parts of podcasts in there (using the [audio * make you’d like to give each word a more advanced categorisation than just ‘remembered’ or ‘not remembered’ * (advanced) you could add to the google sheet to add a column with a date when a ‘remembered’ word should appear in the app again * if you’re a teacher, you might want to distribute this to students and upload new pieces of vocabulary each week. each student can have their own login to mark ‘favourite’ words. * of course, you can change the styling, or anything else about the app. you don’t need to know all this for the app to function, but if you want to make any changes, it’s useful to know how the google sheets works. 1. tab: language pairs - this is where you can change the language pairs, as described above. 2. tab: vocab - raw - this is where the added vocabulary goes, along with any notes that you add. when you mark a piece of vocabulary as ‘remembered’, or ‘favourite’, it’s stored in here. 3. tab: vocab with translation - this worksheet just copies the inputted vocabulary from the previous tab, and then adds the translation and the created date. if you are familiar with google sheets, this will be familiar to you - it’s just using a google translate formula within the cell. if you aren’t familiar with google sheets, you can either read up on what is happening here, or just be happy that this is where your vocabulary gets translated into the language you want it to be. 4. tab: vocab notes - this is where your vocab notes are stored. 5. tab: language pairs (iso) - this is where your language preferences are stored. 6. tab: language options (iso) - this is where the options are stored for the languages. you can also check out the video walkthrough and the original article hope this is helpful to some :)",none,5

c994751a-af6e-4c3a-99c0-cd3ff8e27f1d,changes to tripadvisor that you might not be aware of...,"my wife and i have been running a small boutique beach resort for almost two years now and so it's been fascinating to sit on the other side of the fence and see how the ota's (online travel agents, i.e. expedia, orbitz, hotwire) operate from a business point of view and how this effects the user experience. the same goes for tripadvisor. (we don't use yelp as we're located in mexico but there is tons of controversy surfacing these days about review manipulation in exchange for cash, i.e. premium listings.) as a user most of us are simply hunting for ""the best deal"" and often times we get so caught up in the dollars and cents that we don't always choose the best overall choice to fit our needs. i totally get that otas and tripadvisor are out to earn a profit for themselves and that they neither have the user nor the listing properties' best interest at heart when it comes to their business model...i am not naïve enough to not see that there is no such thing as a ""free"" service...but, i thought that i'd share some of the things i've learned about online bookings and reviews so that travelers who have never had a need to dive into the inner workings of these systems can have a clearer understanding of how this all works. **1. unless you're only interested in bargains, many of the best properties aren't going to be listed on otas.** sites like expedia charge between 15-30% commission and require that properties block off a guaranteed section of rooms just for them. they also mandate that expedia is given the best price anywhere online. most bookings through expedia are break-even bookings for the property just to get exposure. what this means is that many properties choose to not list...so, if the place you are after is on expedia, by all means book with them, but never use an ota for property search because you are missing out on all of the special, boutique properties. we don't list our place on any of the major booking sites and i know from boutique hotel/b&amp;b owner forums that most small hotels do their best to do the same. **2. properties not listed on an ota know that they are saving money.** if you find a place you love but that only offers direct bookings with no deals, you really should fire them off an email to ask for a discount. the owners/managers understand that they are saving money by not having to pay a commission on direct bookings and so all you have to do is say, ""hey, can you give me a price break for booking direct?"" and there's a good chance that they will. **3. tripadvisor favors properties that are listed with a partner site (aka ota)** tripadvisor's default listing method used to be by ranking...putting the #1 property at the top and then going down the line...but now the default listing is by ""availability"", meaning that if the best properties do not list with an ota they go all the way to the bottom unless you change the listing method. in our category, for example, 6 of the top 10 listings have been pulled from the top page since tripadvisor won't get a commission from these properties. when you go to a category on tripadvisor you now need to change the listing method to ""ranking"" to see the best properties. **4. tripadvisor charges big bucks to list a phone number and website** just because the property you like doesn't have a link doesn't mean there isn't a website...it is just that tripadvisor charges an arm and a leg (literally, it is crazy expensive) to list contact details...our property has just 4 rooms and they want over $1,000/year to list our website and phone number. google the property name and you can get in touch with them direct. there's a lot more going on behind the scenes than most travelers realize! if you have any questions i am more than willing to answer them. edit: one more thing i forgot to add...if you're looking at a listing that does not use an ota tripadvisor advises that you check availability for other properties that do with the following message: *we can't find prices for this accommodation. our online travel partners don't provide prices for this accommodation, but we can search other options in puerto escondido* again, this has nothing to do with whether or not the property has availability or not and everything to do with tripadvisor trying to fool you into booking elsewhere so that they get paid. **there has been some confusion here so i want to clarify something: by no means am i suggesting you don't use otas and/or tripadvisor.** particularly in cases where you are traveling from hotel to hotel and are just looking for the best deal, otas are great. it is more so when you are booking a ""vacation"" that i am talking about. when you are flying in to one place, staying a week, and then flying home. in these situations it may not be in your best interest to only search on expedia, for example, as your results will not list all of the boutique options in that destination. this is the case with our resort...we get the occasional reservation from someone spending a few days in oaxaca city and a few days on the coast but the vast majority of our guests fly in, stay with us for a week, and fly home. for tripadvisor all i am suggesting is that you check the listing settings to be sure that you're being shown the highest ranked properties for your given category and that you bear in mind that ta is looking for ways to encourage you to view hotels that use otas.",none,5

57a5bf5c-09f0-463e-ac15-8750727832ea,a small story of how travel has changed my outlook on life,"i'm in love with the art of storytelling. i want to tell you all one. it's the story of the biggest change of my life. i had to run away from it all. all of it, i was just sick of my life. in 2012 i was 25, i shared a home with my live-in girlfriend, in a destructive relationship, a job that was killing me with crazy hours, about 25 pounds overweight with a mortgage that was tying me down to that job. i was drinking heavily, and yet still somehow making my way to work every morning. when i finally decided that between my personal and professional life i was burnt out, i ended my relationship, had to sell my house, and moved back in with my parents while i figured out where to live next. during a pretty crazy day at work (which had become the norm for me in retrospect), an expatriate co-worker had mentioned how anyone under the age of 30 can apply for a one-year work visa in australia. when i got home that day around 11p.m., after a 13-hour work day, i googled it out of curiosity. the application for an australian visa was ridiculously simple; it said it would take only 15 minutes and roughly 200 dollars. i figured, why the hell not? l filled it out, went to bed and forgot about it. a few days later, i got an email saying the application was approved and i could go to oz whenever i wanted. that's when a light turned on in my brain... why was i sticking around at this job? i was the most ""successful"" person i knew at my age, and was at the top of my game. i had garnished enough awards and experience than some of my staff twice my age in some cases. but why did it feel like i had a hole in my chest where happiness was supposed to be? the lesson that i had to learn was that success doesn't mean happiness. i had to have a long, hard look at my future. you know there's a certain fear that comes with getting really good in a specialised field. the fear is, that you might not be good at doing something else starting at square one, so it's better to stick with what you know. the problem is, if i continued down this career path, i would still be working unrewarding, unsatisfying jobs like this forever, helping big corporations make even more money, climbing corporate ladders, working the same bullcrap until i'm 65 and then, after this lifestyle had robbed me of my youthful energy, then i'm supposed to retire and enjoy myself? by then i'd have kids, mortgages, huge expenses and medical bills to pay. when exactly would any of that feel like i had accomplished anything worth doing when work takes up 8 to 14 hours of my day, every day? those retirement investment commercials try to convince you that life begins at 65, but we all know that isn't true. life begins when you decide to grab it by the metaphorical balls, squeeze them and call it your bitch. it begins when you stop ""cruising"" in life, stop taking the path with the least resistance, and stop making excuses for yourself about where you are in life, and why you're not pursuing your dreams. life begins when you choose to make your future happen, instead of letting the present dictate your life as time goes by. so that's what i did, i chose to stop cruising and start choosing. i finally decided to quit not only my job, but my career. i hated my life and i needed to some time to reflect on what to do next. what better way than to see the world while i was still young, before i made a permanent decision like settling down, buying another house or having kids? with the sale of the house, i used the profits to plan a trip around the world, starting in australia. once i quit my job, i sold most of my belongings, shed a ton of weight and spent the following year visiting 26 countries and 96 cities armed with a gopro, a guitarlele, and whatever clothes i could fit into my backpack while living as a traveling vagabond, on whatever money i had saved up. it was the best year of my life so far, being disconnected from any trace of my life back home, living modestly. the idea of spoiling myself was on some of the comforts of a hotel room or a nice restaurant meal every once and a while. i was happiest when not focused on worldly possessions but of memorable experiences with memorable people. i couldn't have done it without that snap decision of filling out that visa application on a whim that planted a tiny idea in my head. when i returned to toronto from that amazing, life-changing year, i came back refreshed and happy, but about 8k debt. i was offered a new position in my old career when i wasn't even looking. since i had to pay that off the debt, i took the offer knowing this job would be temporary at most, 1 year maximum. during this year i ended up falling into old habits of being a workaholic, gaining stress weight and never truly having enough time to pursue my passions. so instead i opted to spend any other free time and money investing in myself, learning, reading and practicing. 2016 is going to be very different than 2015. by the end of april i'm going to be quitting my job again to pursue a hobby that i am going to try to turn into a career and a lifestyle. in may, i'm saying goodbye to my friends and family here in toronto to drive across canada with everything that i own, to live with a modest income with more free time and to pursue a career of trying to be a film director. i'm going to pursue my love of the art of storytelling. it can be daunting and scary doing something for the first time at square one, with no idea if you'll be successful or not, but it is something that i need to do, or i'll forever regret not trying. i am going to trade a successful yet unsatisfying career for an inexperienced one that may end up failing at, but makes me happy. traveling abroad taught me that you don't need much to survive, and worldly possessions aren't important. armed with that confidence, i'm going to stop taking the path of least resistance and start choosing the road less traveled . i will be a captain of the ship that's my life, i will be the master of my fate.",none,5
8fc79f49-2a6a-40d5-84f7-70fe4f718988,i'm not afraid to talk to natives anymore. i just thought i'd share my experience.,"tl;dr: it took me a long time to lose the fear of speaking to natives, but when i did it was great. it improved my english a lot. you can do it, too. one of the best things that's ever happened to my english was after i finally lost the fear of speaking it. i've never really had much of a problem speaking english with other portuguese speakers, but i noticed that my biggest fear was talking to natives. i still remember i had native friends to text with, but whenever i wanted to send a voice message i would go to the point of writing down what i wanted to say and read it when recording the message. it took me a long time until i had a conversation with a native for the first time using my voice (skype). i believe i was already an advanced student at that point. my hands would shake a lot and i would trip over my words. now i can say that trying to speak it did pay off. almost one year ago i met another guy online (from the usa). he invited me to have a conversation over skype and, even though it wasn't my first time doing that, it had been a while. plus, he was the first native i talked to over that phone that wasn't for language exchange reasons but rather just a casual conversation. i was reluctant at first but accepted it and then never stopped again. we became best friends. after that, we've had conversations with topics that ranged from the weather to literature. from jokes to discussions. from arguments to getting things off our chests. now i don't even feel that i'm switching languages when i start a conversation with a native. the words in english come to my mouth way faster than they used to. i no longer feel nervous before a call. i've even helped my native friend finish sentences when he couldn't find the word he was looking for. i've learned a lot of new words, too. i pretty much feel on the same level as my friend. and i don't mean the same level of english, but rather in the sense that even though i still make mistakes and have questions, it's like my mind ""isn't aware"" that i'm talking to a foreigner anymore. i feel comfortable enough. with that in mind, i just wanted to address people who have a hard time talking to native speakers of english (or any other languages that you might be learning). i wanted to say it can be done. and when you get there and notice that you are speaking, it'll be a great feeling of accomplishment. just keep trying, keep practicing and keep making mistakes and learning from them. start small with a voice message and then build up from there. that will open doors to an even more advanced level of english, since there is so much out there that english textbooks don't cover; and having contact with natives is, in my opinion, one of the only ways to achieve that. i still have a lot to learn. i still make mistakes. but so do natives. i'm glad i kept trying. it did pay off in the end.",none,5

c7194a93-f8cf-4b84-859a-04685b2f5218,"letter from gay son to romney-supporting dad: ""my dad was going to vote for romney, until i wrote him this letter""","dad, i saw your recent post on facebook “liking” mitt romney and had to write. (admittedly, i’m still getting used to my 66 year-old father using facebook, but given what i’m about to write, i assure you i’m quite supportive of it.) though your public support for romney doesn’t surprise me, given how open you’ve been about your dislike of president obama, it does bother me. since coming out to you and mom nineteen years ago, i’ve watched you vote for the republican candidates in every major race. save for the occasional mealtime argument or sarcastic fox news barb, i’ve held my tongue, despite the hurt and anger that came from watching you vote for a party that has made a sport out of demonizing gay and lesbian people, like me, for political gain. i did so because i never had a solid enough argument that the democratic party was wholly different. they often stopped short of institutionalizing discrimination of gays, but were sadly lax on standing on principle and advocating for its eradication. until now. for the first time in our nation’s history, a u.s. president and his party have publicly stated that gays and lesbians are equal citizens and should be such under the law. i know you’re aware that obama believes gays and lesbians, like me, should have the rights and responsibilities of marriage and that the 2012 democratic party platform will include marriage equality as one of its tenets. you will never know what it is to be gay in this world at this moment, but i’d bet at some point in your life you’ve known how it felt to have your essential worth validated by someone with authority. i can’t overstate the power of having my president and his party say to me, and the nation, that i am not less than, but equal to, and validate my inherent right to pursue my life with liberty and unimpeded happiness. never before has this happened. so, never before have i made the argument that you should vote for the democrat. but, today’s a new day. four months ago, i sat at my younger brother’s wedding and watched you well up, speaking publicly with pride for the man he’s become and the woman he chose. his life, though certain to have unexpected turns ahead, has a clear path, one available to him simply because of his sexual orientation at birth. mine has never been so clear. oftentimes, being gay feels like being a salmon swimming upstream. our relationships aren’t supported by tradition or institution, any models we may have remain hidden, as openness invites derision, and the pressures to carve a life out with another person, minimally as equally affected by the ever-present fear, instilled in us from our earliest memories that we’re different and unlovable and bad, can often be too much to bear. and yet, not always. the resiliency of my community, in the face of such misunderstanding and hate, is astonishing and inspiring. they’ve taught me to think twice before underestimating the will of the human spirit in its slow march toward progress, whatever the circumstances. i’m almost forty. both of my younger brothers are married, enjoying all the rights and responsibilities of that government-issued status. do you want that for me? do you believe i should have someone beside me on life’s journey, legally recognized as my spouse, able to visit me in the hospital, able to make my end-of-life decisions, with whom i’m able to build a financially interdependent life? i have to believe you do. i have to believe you’re too good a man not to. because if you don’t… if, like the candidate you’re supporting, you believe marriage should only be between one man and one woman, i feel sorry for us both: you, because it means you’re on the wrong side of history and your own son’s happiness and me, because it means my father does believe i’m “less than.” in any other election, given any other choice, i’d stay quiet. if you, and others like you, wanted to believe the worst about obama – a good man, trying to do good work – and vote against your interests (romney’s tax and medicare plans won’t help you), i’d shake my head in wonder and watch you do it anyway. but this isn’t any other election. this election presents a clear choice between two people whose policy beliefs directly affect the course of my life. let me be clear: a vote for mitt romney is a vote against me. there is no argument to counter that fact. you might want to argue that you’re not a single-issue voter, but when the single-issue is your own son’s equality under the law, i wouldn’t recommend that argument. you might want to argue that, because you live in new york state, your vote won’t ultimately matter since obama will carry the state anyway. you’re correct. he will. in that way, i suppose, your vote won’t matter. but it matters to me. you might want to argue just because you don’t like the idea of your son telling you what you ought to do. but, whatever else, you know i’m a good man. it’s been said, “all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing;” and i’m a good man who’s never been good at that. will i change your mind? i hope so. i’m sure mom would tell me it’s a lost cause. and maybe she’s right. but that would be sad. because it might be nice to one day have my father stand up at my wedding, realizing he helped make it happen. your son edit: my dad's reply, in part: ""i will honor your request because you are my son and i love you. i do support the democratic position on gay marriage...i hope this is a position that they really stand for and not just a political statement for votes."" edit: after being picked up and published by the huffington post, this letter became its sixth best lgbt moment of the week.",none,5

7c5db891-d748-4bbb-8eb7-e54018ef11eb,"i didn't plan on getting too involved in the upcoming presidential election, until i read an ap article today about how santorum is attacking prenatal screenings for birth defects. now i'm enraged and i plan on making my voice heard. here's my personal story.","first off, here's the link to the story i read: tldr; former senator santorum wants to eliminate requiring insurers to cover screenings for birth defects because he thinks it encourages women to have abortions. his opinions are not only narrow-minded, but also dangerous. here's my story: my wife and i were married in september of 2005. after a few years of marriage, we decided to start trying to have a baby. after years and years of frustration with no results, we finally conceived in the summer of 2010. both of us &amp; our families were overjoyed. we immediately started baby shopping &amp; picking out names &amp; working on the nursery ... all the things that excited first time parents do. my wife was also very fastidious with her prenatal care. she routinely attended all of her doctor's appointments and followed all their instructions to a tee. part of that prenatal care included a screening for birth defects. neither of us gave it much thought, she went to the lab one day &amp; took the test. on the night of our 5 year wedding anniversary, we received a call from our ob that the test results came back and some of the findings were ""concerning"". she wanted us to schedule an ultrasound with a specialist asap. the day for the ultrasound comes around and instead of heading back to one of the exam rooms like we expected, instead we were taken to an office of a genetic counselor who walked us thorough all these different birth defects. it was like getting broadsided by a bus. after talking with the counselor, we met with a tech that performed the ultrasound. i can remember this next moment like it just happened. neither i nor my wife are doctors, so we have no idea what to look for during the ultrasound. we both just thought it was neat seeing our baby for the first time. after a while, the doctor walked in and took a quick look at the screens. before he said anything, he put a box of tissues in front of my wife ... and my heart immediately sunk. he let us know, very frankly, that there was definitely a problem with the baby and that in his opinion it was most likely trisomy 18. chances for survival to full term were nearly 0%. he advised that we should do an amniocentesis, so we knew exactly what we were dealing with. i'm not really a crier, but i remember that day weeping for not only the baby that we were losing, but also for the health and safety of my wife. a few days later the results of the amniocentesis came back and it was determined that the baby had triploidy. basically the baby had 3 copies of each chromosome instead of 2. there was no chance that the baby would live and my wife would most likely miscarry any day. we reviewed all of our options. option 1 was to wait for nature to take its course and my wife would have to go through all the pain (both physical &amp; emotional) of childbirth. option 2 was to do a d&amp;e. basically my wife would be put under and an hour later it would be over. i'm sure that you can guess which route we went with. but let's get back to the whole purpose of this story ... former senator santorum's idiotic notion that prenatal screenings are somehow bad. had my wife not taken that test, we wouldn't have know that there was a problem and most likely she would have miscarried - not only putting her immediate health at risk, but also jeopardizing our chances of having a baby in the future. aside from the physical risks, it also gave us a chance, as a family, to come to acceptance over the situation over time. having immediate access to counselors and the wonderful staff at wellspan helped us get through, what had to be, the worst day of our lives. former senator santorum - you have just motivated me to now get involved. i had planned on only just voting for obama and calling it a day. now i will do everything in my power to let people know what kind of narrow minded asshole you are. you are a toxic danger to all american women and i will do my part in seeing that your candidacy is defeated. you may notice that i kept referring to him as ""former senator"". that's because i'm from pa &amp; we've fired his ass 1x already &amp; we’re going to do it again. edit: wow, front page. thank you so much for all your kind words. it means more to me than you'd know.",none,5

0d729f9b-3cbd-40dd-8326-771723078528,a rant about self-help gurus and self-help literature [np],"tl;dr : if you are reading a self-help book, it is most likely written by a proven professional scammer or someone who's only accomplishments in life are writing self-help books. their advice, cds, dvds, seminars, workshops will have no lasting impact on you whatsoever. at best, they are placebos. do not make the mistake of continuously looking for ""that one self-help book"" that will change your life. ============================================ yesterday, there was a post about a ""life changing"" book called ""the subtle art of not giving a fuck"" by mark manson. i've read this book myself and i liked a few things about it, but overall, i just wanted to give my opinion on the self-help genre. my whole life, i've been looking for a book by an elon musk or a steve wozniak who wrote about how they vanquished their crippling self-doubt before founding tesla/apple. *except you won't find one*. i challenge any of you guys to find a book like that. i've read steve wozniak's autobiography, and its the opposite of a self-help book. it's mostly about how he was always a genius and how he could invent things very very easily, since his dad was also an engineer, and introduced him to making things from a very young age. i notice that most self-help literature falls into one of three categories : 1. **books by ordained religious gurus** (i.e., hindu, christian, buddhist, zen) like thich naht-han, alan watts, dalai llama, swami vivekananda, pema chodron, etc. all of the people mentioned above have gone through formal religious/monastic training, but their life revolves around their monastic pursuits. to me, these are the more legitimate of self-help literature, but, their authors have not led everyday engineer/doctor lives. in fact, they have consciously rejected the hustle and bustle of the salaried class, which the vast majority of us cannot afford to do. 2. **books by self-help gurus who are not into any business except that of self-help** : take **mark manson**, for example (the author of ""the subtle art of not giving a fuck""). he started a blog on dating advice, and made money through clicks it generated. he then compiled those blog posts into a book. thus, 100% of his literary output thus far consists of self-help books. it's the same with **tim ferris** who wrote ""the four hour work week"", ""the four hour body"", etc - this advice is very very very very unlikely to apply to the salaried class (i.e., you and me), unless you want to drop everything and start a business or a blog. in fact, it doesn't even apply to writers, unless they specialize in self-help literature. tim ferriss's main business before writing these books, by the way, was selling a supplement pill called brainquicken that improves your focus and productivity (lol!). **anthony robbins**, the world's most famous self-help guru - his business is entirely selling motivational books, seminars and of course, ""bioenergy"" supplements. he started out as an apprentice to a guy called **jim rohn**, who was also a self-help guru. jim rohn's career before self-help guru-dom was as the founder of a pyramid scheme (something like amway, called nutri-bio, which sells, you guessed it, nutritional supplements). another self-help book that gets mentioned a lot is ""the slight edge"" by **jeff olson**, which currently has 5 stars on amazon. how did jeff olson make his fortune, other than self-help seminars? he runs a pyramid scheme called nerium international which is being sued for a huge amount for fraud. now, what does nerium international sell ? nutritional supplements that promote ""cognitive function"". then comes **deepak chopra*, pseudo-science personified, who sells the ""vata/pitta/kapha dosha balancing kit"" for $137 each. not too different from our very own **sadhguru**. so all these guys peddle supplements in addition to their books and seminars. then, there's ""think and grow rich"" by **napoleon hill**. this article talks about how napoleon hill is the greatest scammer of all time and it is backed up with a lot of credible sources and details. in fact, his whole empire was built not on one scam, but a series of scams. one of his most famous devotees was a pastor by the name of **norman vincent peale**, who quite predictably, wrote ""the power of positive thinking"" (which received a lot of criticism from the scientific community). btw, donald trump attended his church, and peale presided over trump's first wedding. coming to **dale carnegie** (who wrote ""how to win friends and influence people"") - well - his birth name was dale carnegay. he changed it legally to ""carnegie"" so that people would think that he's related to andrew carnegie, the billionaire steel tycoon (and founder of carnegie mellon university). thus, his fame grew. in short - it's all smoke and mirrors. all of these people became famous due to fraud and misrepresentations, and they're saying ""you can become rich if you read my books/buy my products"", thus making them richer. more recently, we have self-help authors like **teal swan**, **bentinho massaro**, etc, who have all been exposed as cult-like and psycopathic speaking of cults, the religion of ""scientology"" was founded as a self-help cult by **l ron hubbard**, and isn't too different from any of the cults i have mentioned above. except that they took it one step further and registered as a religion for tax purposes. they all work on the model - pay more, and we'll get you one step closer to whatever you desire by teaching you some special technique. transcendental meditation (founded by **maharishi mahesh yogi**, the guru of **sri sri ravishankar** and deepak chopra) is the same - apparently, at a high enough ""level"" (meaning fee), you learn ""yogic flying"". i dare you to find me one self help guru in the above category who doesn't have a sleazy looking web-page selling seminars, cds and dvds and retreats for 1000s of rupees/dollars. just one. because i haven't been able to find it. in fact, most of them charge progressively higher and higher amounts (eg : the ""yes"" course gives you only the basic technique, but the ""yes-plus"" course, which costs twice as much gives you even more advanced techniques. don't have the money? too bad). find me one book written by someone with a normal career (like ""engineer"" or ""doctor"" or ""musician"" or ""architect"") who excels in their primary career even after writing a best-selling self-help book. unfortunately, i count eckhart tolle in this category as well. another famous self-help guru of the 20th century was **p.d ouspensky**, who wrote legitimately thought-provoking material. this essay by his confidant talks about the day to day life of a self-help guru, and how they aren't as ""perfect"" or ""blissful"" as they seem - it is very eye-opening, so i urge you to read it. if you don't have time to read it, it takes about how ouspensky and his wife took advantage of wealthy followers to enrich themselves and lead a life of luxury. ouspensky himself admitted that somewhere in the process, he had lost ""the way"". 3. self-help books by experts in their field, who speak about how they obtained their expertise after years and years of hard work. i know of very very few books in this category : ""discipline"" by olympic silver medallist mike livingstone (i tried reading this book, but it was extremely technical, and, well, boring). another book was ""deep work"" by cal newport, who is a relatively successful computer science professor. both of these books made no bones about how difficult it is to actually succeed, and all of the sacrifices one would have to make in order to succeed, like working super-hard, getting rid of all your social media, etc. why are there so few books in the third category ? now for the real self-help secret : most geniuses or experts or talents have no idea how they do it. either they were born with it, or they were rigorously coached in their childhood (before the self-doubt phase of adulthood sets in) like michael jackson or tiger woods or mozart, or through some luck/quirk of fate, they acquired it. most importantly, they don't know ""how"" they managed to do it.",none,5

(e.g. how much will it cost you to buy this vehicle new and own it for 5 years?) this doesn't help me, as i also want to consider the possibility of buying used in order to minimize the higher depreciation costs of the first several years of ownership. ideally what i want to do is plot the historical average total cost of ownership of various car models over the lifetime of those vehicles, in order to find the time period where that cost is minimized. for example, suppose one model of car has a high cost of ownership during its first two years due to depreciation, then that cost levels off for years 3-5 before it starts ramping up again due to higher repair and maintenance costs. in such a case i would conclude that it's most cost efficient to buy that particular model of car used when it's 2 years old, own it for 3 years, then sell. i'd like to run this same calculation across many different makes and models of cars in order to find the ones where this period of minimal cost is lowest. (then filter by other criteria of my choosing, such as which optional features each car possesses; though i'm comfortable doing that part manually with a few google searches.) to accomplish this i need data; lots of data. hence my post here. does anyone know if detailed information on the ownership costs of various vehicles is publicly available? or am i out of luck?

(if a _sign_ conflict seems to appear with this, it's always possible to set the _sense_ of the various parameters in such way as to ensure its correctivity.) in [the particular picture that prompted this the shadows are _very nearly_ from left to right across the screen, so __υ__ is close to zero. also, the line from object to camera is close to horizontal, so cos(__α__) is very nearly 1 &amp; sin(__α__) very close to 0. so the final expression for tan(__β__) is dominated by sec(__υ__).sin(__υ__ - __φ__).tan(__θ__). if the slope of the land is close to being from left to right, then tan(__β__) is very nearly tan(__θ__) and the angle made by the image of the shadow _virtually is_ the angle of the land from horizontal. even if the slope of the land is _not exactly_ from left to right, tan(__β__) will be 'diluted' only by a factor sin(__υ__ - __φ__), which is going to be rather close to 1 throughout a considerable range of angle around ½π. basically, one can 'play with' this formula at will, &amp; it becomes evident that over a wide range of orientations of the various items represented in it, the slope of the land makes a significant contribution to the angle made by the image of the shadow in the image. i'd like to add that i _fully realise_ that to most of the contributors to this channel this is just a quantification of what is intuitively obvious ... but i looked-around for the rational explanations of the matter of the shadows in the appollo-mission images, and all the ones i found were disappointingly _glosing_ - kind-of with a tone of ""just believe _it does - right!!_"" ... which i don't much like even when i agree with what they're saying!",none,5

57bb9d74-f4d9-43e5-98fd-2683b60d0477,the united states- the world's greatest backpacking destination. you should try it.,"edit: ok, i half regret going with the title i did. i was just trying to make fun of how the us is actually a terrible travel backpacking destination so people would wonder ""wtf is this dude thinking?"" and the whole murica thing. but seriously, you should try wilderness backpacking. i just didn't think anyone would read my wall of text if i went with something less sensationalized; maybe i was wrong. don't know; can't edit titles. i just see a lot of people talking about coming to the us for the outdoors and almost never see anyone suggest backpacking as an option. made you click ;) nope, not talking about hitting up hostels. i'm talking about buying a pack with a real hip belt and packing all your food and camping gear and carrying it on your back as you hike a trail. r/campingandhiking style. this is (imo) the best way to experience the natural beauty of the us, which is probably our biggest tourist draw. first off, it's important to realize the scale of many of our hiking destinations. in the us, these are often designated [wilderness which means that the wilderness is at least 5,000 acres in size. the reality is that without doing overnight trips or very aggressive (like 20+ mile) dayhikes you are simply not going to see large portions of the best the us has to offer. for example, you aren't getting to the [rae lakes which is widely considered one of the best parts of the john muir trail without doing an overnighter. while i understand the perceived negatives in terms of comfort, necessary skills, etc. i really do believe that the positives far outweigh them. really, the negatives come down to slight discomforts, bug, upfront gear costs, and exertion. well...and the chance of bad weather. don't mess around with shoulder seasons and go to destinations when the weather is good. i've had to set up my tent in the sierra once because of rain. the biggest advantage is that you're backpacking! instead of driving back to the hotel at the end of the day, you sit and watch the sunset. then, the stars come out. many destinations in the us have amazing night skies. instead of waking up in a campground with hundreds of other people running around, you wake up surrounded by the nature you came to experience because you never left it. you experience the dawn hours as the world comes to life and the changing light makes for amazing sights and pictures. the experience of staying out in the backcountry for days at a time is simply amazing and just can't be compared to experiencing it at hours at a time. plus, there's a nice sense of accomplishment when you look up at a pass and then you get on top and you see that your two feet have carried you so far. most tourists will only see a very small fraction of the national parks, sticking with the viewpoints you can drive to or doing shorter trails. by backpacking, you can lose the crowds and (depending on where you go) have a true sense of isolation. for example, i've hiked about 35 miles in sequoia/king's canyon without seeing another person not in my group by going over a less popular pass. there's also something to be said about being in areas that have very limited human impact other than trail work. it's just really cool to be somewhere where the impact of people is relatively low while being relatively accessible and hospitable. with few exceptions such as the wonderland trail or yosemite's donnahue pass quota, wilderness permits are also very easy to get. while nabbing a campsite in yosemite in the peak season requires you to be on the day it becomes available, i've never once reserved a backcountry permit. so, don't stress; just show up to the ranger station early that day. anyways, i think [this 30-photo does a pretty decent job at capturing what it's like to do a backpacking trip from a visual standpoint at least. and lastly, my favorite quote about why i feel like backpacking is more than worth it: &gt; there is nothing more fascinating than going ""over the top"" at a pass--the thrill, the excitement, the mystery of what is beyond! you plod up and up, ever watching your step; over rough rocks, rolling and sliding; over loose, steep shale and sand. you are out of breath; you are weary; the blazing sun beats down upon you; you may say ""what's the use?""--when all at once you reach the top and get that grand expansive view and look over into a promised land, on to weird snow-fields, to silvery, flashing streams, down into azure lakes, up to ragged peaks, into the purest air and the bluest of blue skies. it is the call of the high country; the call of the main crest; the call toward heaven! -james hutchinson, sierra club bulletin (1923) oh ya, and please, please, please go to to read up on proper backcountry ethics and practices. it's not as easy as not tossing your trash everywhere. for example, many new hikers don't understand that biodegradable soap cannot be used in waterways.",none,5

7705fbe2-7e78-461a-8098-3cf66b54c625,the deathly issue with perspectivic visualization of 4 dimensional euclidean space :p,"just a showerthought, but may not be witty enough for /r/showerthoughts... :d i've been dabbling in creative coding and fractal visualizations, and have always been intrigued by the visualization of higher dimension spaces... while i have a pretty good mental model of spaces with more dimensions than 3, i've always found those ubiquitous 4d-to-3d-to-2d perspectivic visualizations completely baffling and weird. i know some people state they can ""infer"" the 4d shape of, say, a hypercube from such a visualization, but all i managed so far was more along the lines of ""okay... wut?"", even though i kinda understand the abstract structure of a hypercube. so... here's what struck me once pondering this question. this ""chain of projections"" is inherently counterintuitive for a human (or any 3 dimensional) observer, as it's no perspectivic projection at all. when we see in 3d space, the focus point, the plane of projection, and the observed object are all in the same 3d space. however, the focus point, the abstract observer, is not on the plane of projection. in a flatland example, if we gave a 2 dimensional being access to the 2d image formed on our retina to wander through, they would be as baffled by it as we are by a 3d projection of 4d space. they would have an idea and inherent understanding of perspectivic projection from their 2d world onto a 1d line, however, our placing the retina image or photograph in their world plane, while the result of perspectivic projection, would be meaningless to \*them\* in the terms they understand perspectivic projections. note how they, as the observer, are not in the location of the 3d observer - in fact, the 3d observer is not on their world plane, occupying a location beyond their very understanding. so just as this would only confuse the 2d observer, rather than help them understand 3d space, using the paradigm of perspective results in the obfuscation of 4d space to us, rather than in any insight or illumination. we're not seeing 4d space in any perspectivic manner - we are instead allowed to wander around a photograph taken by a 4d camera whose location and cone of perspective we are unable to conceptualize beyond the most abstract mathematical understanding. while such iterated perspective projections can result in pretty pictures, i'd say they stop at being pretty. for ""useful"", illuminating visualization of 4d space, i believe the best we can currently do is cross sections. after all, it's how the sphere introduced itself to the 2d beings in the flatland novella, and it works, even if unwieldy. it would be cool though, to define a projection that would result in a 2d image directly from a 4d space, via some modification of the rule of perspective... giving a mathematical simulation of what it would be like to fly a spaceship as 3d beings through 4d space. :)",none,5

2b5919f3-568c-40be-92f9-6888d0d98ffa,"i just ""discovered"" fleetwood mac and feel like i've missed out on so much joy!","i'm in my early 40s and have recently come to learn the magic of fleetwood mac. it's bizarre that i never liked them, well, knowingly liked them, since i am abig fan of guitar/pop rock bands. i sayy knowingly because finding out about them and going through the back-catalog etc. i realized that i actually knew and loved so many of their songs! sorry this is a rambling post by the way! when i was a kid i heard a song that went ""i'd rather jack than fleetwood mac"" (the radio never plays the songs we know"". i think after that song was released i just assumed fleetwood mac was the type of band i wouldn't like, which turned me off to exploring them further. then fast forward to a year or two ago i was listening to an oldies radio station when landslide came on. i had never heard it before. so i googled the song, and learned, of course, it was an fm song. around the same time i was watching an episode of the americans which used the chain to accompany a spying scene... slow build up followed by that baseline. i recall thinking how much i enjoyed the build up part, then the baseline kicked in and i thought, wait a minute, it's the theme tune to the motor racing show i watched in the 80s and 90s. again, google helped me out to learn its an fm song. then i kind of forgot, until a couple weeks ago when somebody on here posted a video of video killed the radio star. that backing vocal of linda allen singing you are a radio star... made me think a song from my childhood that went ""i want to be with you everywhere."" again, google helped me out to find it was, of course, everywhere by fm. mind blown! then i really started looking into the band and realized so many songs i knew from the past i recognized and had previously enjoyed without knowing they were by fm. then i started watching a video on how they made the chain, and learning the relationship sagas that shaped the album, and hearing the pain in their voices while watching them sing live (supported by coke!) the 82 mirage is my favorite, the constant dagger eyes between nicks and buckingham and the cracks in their voices brought tears to my eyes. it's especially interesting because i watch shows like songland and the voice, where coaches talk about knowing the pain behind the lyrics will help the performance. i'm really peeved that i missed out on going to see various tribute bands. especially now i have moved to the us and see that a very good support band will be playing in my home town around my mum's birthday. not sure if we will be wanting to go to concerts at that point due to the virus. at lease now i can watch some old concerts on youtube ""the dance"" tour is a good one. sorry about the rambling nature of this. i guess i just wanted to share how much joy i have in finding out about this band, and an element of regret at not finding out about them earlier. plus, it's interesting to me that even though i didn't know i liked them, i really did because i liked so many songs of theirs, i just didn't know who sung them!",none,5

ca9d5e4c-821e-4fa8-891b-ffd05562b3b1,i just finished 3 months in europe. here are some tips and observations.,"sorry if this has been done before but hopefully someone finds it useful while planning their trip. i know i was reading voraciously during the planning phase of my trip. also thanks for reading. 1. desperately need a washroom but don't want to pay for one? go to a large shopping mall. this is where you are most likely to find a free washroom without a lady looking for tips. if you are out on the street and see a sign with ""wc"" on it you are guaranteed to be paying to use the facilities. mcdonalds charges you even if you buy something. 2. in my experience the city next to a large touristy city is nicer to explore. examples of this: utrecht over amsterdam, olomouc over prague, and bratislava over vienna. the pace is slower and the people are easier going. 3. you are going to remember the things you **do** and not the places you go **to**. what i mean is that you'll have more fun in cities where you can afford to buy a local meal, go to an attraction, and go to the pub with people from the hostel. that's why bratislava was so much more fun for me than vienna. in bratislava 10 euro got you a delicious meal. in vienna 10 euro got you a coffee. 4. hostels make a big difference on your experience in a city. don't just look at the % they get on hostelworld and book it. probably the biggest thing i looked at was how many beds the hostel has. if its above 80 it may as well be a discount hotel. the staff are going to be burnt out husks who don't want to know you and just want to process you asap. in smaller hostels you are much more likely to get to know the people staying in the hostel and be able to socialize. look for a hostel that advertises “for backpackers” or “run by backpackers”. once you've found a hostel **book it directly with the hostel!** hostel booking sites skim 20% of profits which the hostel could have used to make you happier and their staff happier. if the hostel doesn't have online booking off their website just shoot them an email and say you'll be there tomorrow with cash. ask if they can give a small discount. they'll probably be happy to do so. 5. while travelling don’t be afraid to do stuff you like to do back home. i had a blast going to local ice hockey games and i picked up some great souvenirs while digging through flea markets. my girlfriend had a great time birding whenever we went to a park. 6. i didn't find couchsurfing to be useful. i gave it the old college try but it's not reliable enough. you read 20-30 profiles thoroughly. send out 10 personalized requests. then you get no reply and end up booking a hostel. if you want to meet locals i found airbnb a much more useful platform. look for a listing where you will be renting a private room and read each person’s reviews to see if they are described as social. 7. i bought the 7 days in 2 months and 4 countries eurail pass. in the netherlands and germany it saved me a ton of money on long train rides. in the czech republic onward it was totally unnecessary. i ended up breaking even entirely due to 3 train rides. the 4 i used in the czech republic and slovakia would have cost me $70 combined. a train ride from mostar to sarajevo cost $5. the point i'm making is the eurail pass can save you cash in western europe but is totally unnecessary in central europe and the balkans. 8. i never had a problem with pick pockets. whether or not this was blind luck is debatable. still, here are my tactics for avoiding problems. bus depots, train stations, and tourist attractions are going to be your hotspots. look straight at someone you think might be a problem. it lets them know your head isn’t in the clouds. children are a big problem so always remain cautious around them. when walking about do a quick shoulder check behind you to see if someone is following you. pick pockets are looking for easy targets so even if 90% of your actions are pointless it exudes vigilance which will deter attempts. basically this: 9. my biggest regret is not **packing lighter**. i still only had 40ish lbs which was manageable for me but god damn was it draining to pack up so much crap every 3-4 days. the things i brought which were pointless: a 2nd pair of shoes, a sleeping sheet, a neck pillow, 1-2 too many t-shirts, and a basic first aid kit. 10. travelling in the shoulder season was pretty awesome. being from canada i was more than happy to be out exploring in 15-20 degrees celsius weather. i was still able to go swimming in croatia in mid-november. also, every hostel owner i talked to mentioned how i was coming at the right time because the majority of the crowds had died down. when i was in dubrovnik there was 1 cruise ship anchored per day with a capacity of 5,000 people. in peak season there are 5 cruise ships totaling 25,000 people! hostel prices were also much cheaper and i didn't need to worry about booking hostels well in advance. 11. write in your journal **every day**. getting behind in your journal by a few days sucks. getting behind by a week is a death sentence. in 20 years you might pull that journal off the shelf and be able to vividly remember some of your fondest memories. or you might read a bunch of “and then we went there and it was cool.” 12. i budgeted $50 a day for accommodation, food, and entertainment. in the netherlands and germany this was a challenge as hostels could be $30 a night. in central europe and the balkans i was able to go out for great local cuisine while still staying well under budget. in more expensive areas cooking is a necessity. so learn some easy and basic recipes like soups or stir-frys. not all hostel kitchens will be set up for more involved recipes. also, good luck finding a sharp knife! hahahahaha! 13. here is a controversial one. skip western europe. in central europe and the balkans my dollar went further, there was an abundance of incredible things to do and see, and most importantly the locals weren't as burnt out on tourists. the balkans was my favourite place to go. the people are incredibly genuine and there is amazing natural scenery to see. the coast of croatia is amazing. there really isn’t any other way to put it. montenegro has the most ridiculous mountains i have ever seen. they make you laugh and shake your head at how stupefying they are. bosnia is a great country with incredibly nice people. hearing the muslim call to prayer was one of my favourite memories. it was something i had only heard in movies. just understand there are still hard feelings about yugoslavia so be respectful. **some little thoughts:** carry your money in your front pocket where it is safest. bring a money clip to keep all of your bills nice and neat in your pocket. bring a small point and shoot camera and keep it in your other pocket. then you never miss a chance to snap a memory. pre-rolled joints in amsterdam will be cut 50/50 with tobacco which makes them painful to inhale. coming from british columbia i had no clue this was the case and almost betrayed my heritage by hacking and coughing. definitely bring a book you want to read. you’ll have plenty of downtime while travelling and you’ll need something to kill time. bring a smartphone with you for surfing the web and booking hostels. also, the night before you travel to a new city load up the location of your next hostel on google maps. it should stay loaded up offline giving you an interactive map which is extremely helpful.",none,5

630dc94b-7c5d-49bd-b25a-c029c9cfe35d,please. please. please. stop it with the bullshit budget advice.,"reddit is great for a lot of things. a lot. but shoestring travel advice is not one of these things. i get the desire to want to travel the world on the price of 2 mcdonald's value meals per day with a few bucks left over for a bottle of gut-rot local booze. i really do. i understand why the ""$5 hotel room view"" post was so insanely popular. i do. and i totally get why most of us choose to travel more frugally for longer as opposed to packing half-way-round-the-world trips into one work week and a pair of weekends. but 99% of the ridiculously low bullshit budgets posed in this forum are just that: bullshit you're not helping anyone by fudging the numbers on how little you spent during your travels - all you're really doing is setting up those who don't know any better to run out of money. there are only three ways that these ""i can't believe it"" budgets are being calculated: - a flat out lie. - a genuine miscalculation that's not accounting for transport costs or any of the other one-time expenses that come up during a long trip. - you are relying on the kindness of strangers' money along the way...which in essence means that your trip ""did"" cost more, it was just someone else footing the bill. so if you've yet to take the plunge and are all woopity-doo excited about seeing the world on $20/day, remember that these figures are always skewed one way or another. they don't account for the times every hostel is full and you have to pay for a hotel or the medical bills when you get sick or the extra fees you get for going overweight with your baggage or the coat you had to buy because it was colder than you'd planned and on and on and on. when people tell you these daily costs it's almost always just room &amp; board that they are calculating. travel can be cheap. very cheap. but not nearly as cheap as a good number of people in this sub perpetuate...and certainly not if you want to actually ""do"" anything and enjoy yourself. so please, if you want to advise others with a ridiculous shoestring budget, at least be honest about which expenses you've omitted and which activities/experiences must be skipped to make this budget work (if it's even possible). edit: i'll try to express this as succinctly as possible - i am not telling anyone how to travel or saying anything disparaging about super shoestring travelers...travel as you wish and do whatever you'd like...all i am saying is that if you are the type to travel like a hobo (no judgment, that's just what it is) then don't tell someone who's never been overseas before that some crazy low $x/day is ""more than enough"" when you know damn well the experience the average backpacker is after can't be had on that budget. the average budget traveler doesn't want to sleep on strangers' couches, hitchhike, illegally camp off the side of the highway and never go to bars/restaurants....if this is how you travel, i am simply suggesting you save your budgeting advice for others who are seeking the same.",none,5

b0ee5828-90e2-4c38-8737-2cb1641f2579,visa tips and requirements,"the rules for visas can be confusing, so i thought i'd put together some info on applying for them. some of this info will be a little us-centric, but the general process will be the same regardless of which passport you have. a visa is basically permission to enter a country. you **always** need a visa when visiting another country, but some countries have set up a (reciprocal) 'visa-waiver' where you don't need to apply for one if you meet the visa waiver requirements. these requirements will depend on which passport you have. for example, us citizens (and australia/canada/etc) can visit certain european (schengen) countries for combined 90 days out of 180 days without a visa. however, if you want to stay more than 90 days in the schengen zone, you **will** need a visa. thailand is another example, where us citizens don't need a visa if staying less than 30 days (arriving by air) or 15 days if arriving via land. most western europe/canada/usa/australia passports are lucky as many european/north american countries do not require visas for short visits. failing to check visa requirements beforehand can be a very expensive problem! airlines will refuse to let you board unless you have the correct documentation. one other important thing to check is how much time is left before your passport expires, many countries require your passport to be valid for 6 months (even if your stay is shorter). a good place to start checking visa requirement is the wikipedia page. search for 'visa requirements for x citizens' where x is your passport. etc. or check the 'visa policy of x' for the country you are planning to visit. etc. really the best way to check if you need a visa is using the timatic database, this is what the airlines will use. **visas at an embassy/consulate:** if you require a visa, usually you must apply for a visa at a country's consulate or embassy. the actual visa is a stamp or whole-page sticker in your passport. visa requirements unfortunately can vary per embassy, but the basic things you will need are a filled out application, visa fee, and your passport. there are usually three ways to go about applying. first, you can go to the embassy/consulate yourself. this is obviously inconvenient if you don't live in a city with a consulate. this also involves some amount of waiting time, so you will need at least a free day. another way of applying is using a visa service. you send them your application, passport and visa fee. the visa service also will charge their own service fee on top of that. the final way to apply is to send the application directly to the embassy/consulate via usps/fedex, with a pre-paid return envelope. however, some embassies (eg. china in the us) no longer accept mailed-in applications and you must use a service or apply in person. best to check the application requirements on their website. however you apply, the visa can take several days or weeks to issue, so be sure to give yourself plenty of time. if using a visa service, add an extra couple of days. some places offer same-day or next-day processing for an extra fee. i always use some sort of tracking (fedex, us priority express) so that i can keep track of where my passport is and when it is on it's way back. i actually applied for a visa last week and i saw my return tracking go live yesterday, i'll have my passport back tomorrow. payment for visas is usually via cashier's check/money order, at least in the us. in some other countries, if applying in person you must go to the embassy, get a form then go to a bank and pay, get a receipt, then return to the embassy with that receipt. pretty inefficient unfortunately. this is what i had to do when applying for my iranian visa in istanbul. checklist for applying for visa (* are sometimes requirements): * passport * filled out application (usually x2) * passport photos (usually x2) * visa fee * copy of flight itinerary * prepaid return envelope (if applying via mail/visa service) * copy of hotel reservations(*) * cover letter(*) * copy of bank statement(*) * copy of yellow-fever vaccination(*): required for some african countries * letter of introduction from travel agent(*) : required for russia, some african and central-asian countries the visa application can usually be downloaded from the embassy website. visahq is another good (us) resource for finding applications and requirements (generally for the copy of the flight itinerary, i will use something like tripit and generate an itinerary without actually buying the tickets. not completely kosher, but i like to pad my planned visit dates by a day or two on either end just in case plans change (i still put in the same flight numbers i plan to use) or the visa gets denied for some reason (luckily iran's so far the only one i've had denied). i ended up needing this padding when visiting the congos a few years ago... my flight to kinshasa (dr congo) was diverted to brazzaville (rep congo). if my rep congo visa wasn't valid yet i wouldn't have been able to get off the plane. the cover letter is usually optional but i'll usually write one. basically it just lays out what kind of visa i would like, and my planned itinerary and perhaps something nice to say about the country i am visiting. **visas on arrival:** some countries can issue a visa when you arrive at the airport or at a border. these on-arrival visas may have different stay requirements or fees than one obtained in an embassy. some visa on arrival require pre-authorization before travel. this can be arranged usually though a travel agent, hotel, or website. the pre-authorization can take a few days. you will receive a confirmation email that you show at airport checkin and on arrival to receive your visa. there will usually be a window labeled 'visa' before immigration where you will get your visa sticker. **e-visas: ** these are the latest type of visas, which require applying and paying online ahead of your visit. similarly to pre-arranged voa, you will get a printout/verification that you show at immigration on arrival. this verification can take a few hours or days to receive. e-visas may also have different requirements/limitations than a visa issued at an embassy. **passport photos:** most paper visa applications require one or two passport photos. it's actually quite easy and cheap to make your own. you will need a tripod or someone to take a photo of you against a white background. an easy way to do this is to drape a sheet over a door. don't worry about getting the photo perfectly centered. just make sure to have a neutral face, nothing covering your face, etc. then use an online photo-sizing tool to center the face. 2""x2"" are usually fine when applying for visas. you can then use gimp/photoshop/etc to create a tiled 4""x6"" image (6 photos). some online sites can do this as well. you can then upload &amp; print this at walgreens/cvs/walmart/etc for $0.30 or so. i'll usually get 3-4 printed at a time as i apply for a lot of visas! if you use european/uk visa photo (35mm x 45mm) tiling you can get 8 per page. here are some countries that require some sort of visa: * usa: requires pre-approval (etsa) if from a visa-waiver country. * australia: requires pre-authorized eta (us) or evisitor visa (uk) * india: e-visa * turkey: e-visa * iran: complicated. some countries get visa-on-arrival (aussies). brits/canadians/us need a visa beforehand. * egypt: visa on arrival, easy * bahrain: e-visa or visa on arrival. * jordan: visa on arrival (at airport), easy. visa required beforehand if crossing overland at allenby bridge. * brazil: us citizens need a visa, europeans don't * argentina: us citizens must pay reciprocity fee before travel ($160) - but good for life of passport * china: visa required beforehand. some countries can get 72-hr visa-free transit (eg. flying usa -&gt; beijing -&gt; thailand you could stay 72 hrs in beijing). * vietnam: visa-free (brits, some europeans) for 15-day stays. for longer stays, or us citizens, pre-authorized visa on arrival available at airports only. otherwise visa required beforehand if arriving via land. pre-authorized visas can be arranged through , etc. there are lots out there, just pick the cheapest. takes 2-3 days to get the visa authorization. * thailand: visa-free for 30-days if arriving by air. 15 if arriving via land. * laos: visa on arrival * russia: visa required beforehand. it may be possible to visit st. petersburg and some other cities for 72-hrs without a visa if you are on a cruise/tour. * sri lanka: e-visa",none,5
