none,depression,5,"okay, hi. so here’s the story. i’m a young drummer girl who’s been playing drums in pennsylvania for 2 years now. earlier today, i walked in to my usual once-a-week lesson. turned out my regular teacher was out and i had a sub. i didn’t know who it was. we started 10 minutes late. at the start, we just chatted for a while, and he asked me a few things about myself. i unfortunately neglected to tell him i had lived in scotland most of my life, which i regret now, as it is an interesting little fact. it was a really interesting chat, and he was talking about how he always preferred female drummers. he started telling me about his band called the hooters, which i vaguely recognized the name of but i wasn’t sure. i didn’t want to say anything. was over. i left, and thanked him again. i waited a little while for my mom to pick me up, and when i got into the car, i told her about my drum lesson. i said he was quite odd but interesting. i genuinely thought what he had to say was very fascinating. then i mentioned that he said something about him being in the hooters. she immediately was shocked. she told me to google the drummer for the quite popular band and turns out, i had just had a lesson with david uosikkinen himself. shook. later found out a friend of mine has him for her regular lessons. she’s quite lucky as he’s a really cool guy to talk to and just generally quite interesting. i hope he teaches me again someday. well there you go. a little story. i doubt anyone cares haha"

bipolar,depression,7,"i'm on my fourth new therapist this year. y'know it takes a while to warm up to them and be comfortable trusting them. i was just getting to the point of really liking the one i was seeing and they just called to tell me she's leaving. i know therapists are people and life happens to them and shit but argh. now i'm back to square one of having to feel out this new person and explain all my shit to them and get them to the point of having *me* figured out. it feels like a waste of my goddamn time...i've told my story to so many people and just when they get to the point of actually helping me i get stuck back at square one. fuck. i'm just pissed off o we need to figure out who else you can have as a support."" bitch please, we've been in a long term relationship longer than you've had your counseling license i'd wager...just because we aren't married doesn't mean it's ""unstable."" i went home and mailed my old therapist and said, ""hey i'm sorry to hear you're going i hope everything works out ok, if you're still practicing in the area please let me know where and i'll go with you"" and she wrote me back and said basically ""thanks for being my patient, i'll still be practicing and i'll be in touch soon."" so....hopefully i can go back to her because this new girl just made me want to punch something."
bipolar,depression,8,"i feel unstoppable today. like nothing can get in my way. i had so much fun at work last night it was great. if this is stability, i love it. i thought it would be boring but nope. i haven't felt this excited to be alive in ages. yes, i'm broke basically and have some potentially scary health things going on but it's not bringing me down like usual! i woke up at 4 excited to face the day and it's many challenges. i'm gonna wreck them. go stability! i'm just hoping this doesn't result in a catastrophic crash soon. that would reallllyyy suck. lol i can't wait for work tonight."

adhd,depression,10,"i'm sorry this is so long. but i'm desperate. i've been with my fiancé for 5 years. i'm a type a personality, highly anxious and - unfortunately - can be controlling as a result. i also have a high stress job as an attorney and work a lot. i'm starting to think he and i are fundamentally mismatched. or, maybe i need a swift kick in the ass and to calm down a bit. i'm hoping for some perspective. he's very kind and thoughtful in a lot of ways. most ways. but he has a number of adhd-related personality traits (i believe and please, correct me if i'm wrong) that are driving me absolutely *insane*. (1) **the bank.** he simply appears unwillingly to handle an issue when it arises. for example, he had been receiving letters from his bank informing him that the automatic payments he was making towards a loan were insufficient. he got a letter about it every month for 4-6 months. i showed him the letters and asked him to *please* see what the issue was. i went into his email recently (we have full access to each other's devices) and saw an email from credit karma saying his credit score took a hit. and it did. from 720 to 590 . . . because he never called the bank back. when he finally did call the bank, they said they would not reverse the reporting. and he proceeded to throw a fit about how the bank ruined his credit. never mind the *incredible* impact this will have on our future if we need to make any big purchases like a house or moving. he now has shit credit and he's a risk. who is going to rent to us? (2) **to-do list.** he seems to not keep a running list of the things he needs to take care of in his head, like i do. he forgets things he promised to do *constantly* which has resulted in me more-or-less not trusting anything he says. he refused - for reasons i don't understand - to write things down for a while. trying to be understanding, i bought a blackboard and kept a list for him. it didn't seem to help. (3) **sleeping habits.** he *never* gets enough sleep. and so when we hang out a night, he almost always falls asleep on the couch at some point before bed time. this is frustrating for me because i rarely get to sleep next to him and, due to my anxiety, can't relax and just watch tv late at night because i'm worried he's going to fall asleep and miss what we're watching (so i'll have to rewatch it the next day).to please let me finish what i'm doing, please let me work, that i don't want to talk to him anymore at the moment, that i just want to be alone and silent, and it has almost no impact on him. he' ll say ""okay"" and nevertheless keep talking for 5-15 minutes. asking him to stop again often causes a fight. he's lapsed into saying, ""come on, there are worse things than your fiancé wanting to talk to you."" which is hugely beside the point. (6) **finishing tasks.** the laundry is still in the dryer and now needs to be re-washed or ironed. the sheets are on the bed, but not the pillowcases. he got the credit card bill but it got lost in his messy work truck. he has to wake up an hour early on monday to finish paperwork he had all weekend to do. the pants he should have returned *six months ago* are still on the table. his shoes are so gross i can smell his feet sometimes when he's *wearing them* but not amount of begging and promises to buy 7 pairs if we can just go to the shoe store together so i don't have to hear (and withstand the embarrassment) of my family members asking him whether he wants new boots for his birthday. we got into a massive fight about bills recently. he rarely remembers to pay his bills so i took over the finances for both of us. he said he wanted to start paying his own credit card bill and i got worried since his credit will soon affect us both. we fought insanely about it and i relented with the caveat that if he doesn't pay it on time, i'm taking the payments over again. he agreed. it didn't last one month because he failed to timely pay the bill not four days after our fight. (7) **therapy.** due to these issues, i suggested couples' counseling. he agreed. the therapist has repeatedly suggested he get adhd testing. gave him the names of some doctors. he's pretty much told me at this point that it's not something he's going to do. after five years, i got frustrated and made it clear i would not marry him until he did. he hasn't made the appointment. so, am i an asshole? not understanding enough? do i need to relax and put things into some perspective? he says i'm constantly critical, which is true. but i feel like he constantly doesn't listen and is failing to respect me as an adult who *maybe just doesn't want to listen anymore.* i'm lost. i don't know what else to do. any advice would go so far!"
ptsd,depression,11,"it’s been a long time, but i’ve never been able to school myself into calm when i see something moving out of the corner of my eye. walking across a baseball field, basketball court, or anything with moving projectiles puts me on edge and every sound is like something being thrown directly at me. after a year of dating, it finally happened. my boyfriend made a gesture like pointing at me, with something in his hand. i flinched. as usual, jerked my head and closed my eyes. he held tightly to me, and told me over and over again (with tears in his eyes) how he’d never throw anything at me. ever. it just shows, after the many years of my life, i finally have a shoulder to lean on. and yours may not be far away, so please don’t give up."
adhd,depression,12,"so my son has adhd. near the end of literature class, he walks to the teach and turns in his poem that he wrote. teachers says thanks, but what is this? he replies, it is my poem that you asked us to write . . . she just smiles and said ""i did not ask you to write a poem"". so, t and showed it to the principle (who my son knows well due to getting in trouble) and the principle came to the class to complement him on the poem. it made my son's day, but still some smiles about him being off task, but at least this time in a good way. just wanted to share."
bipolar,depression,13,"just curious, because i've heard that quite a few brilliant and successful people are bipolar. being afflicted with the illness myself, i don't understand how someone with bp can function at a high level for extended periods of time. so, here's my question. is there such a thing as a high functioning bp person? are you one? do you know one? or have you heard of anyone like that? just curious."
adhd,depression,14,"this occurred to me as was, ironically, procrastinating on my studies. throughout my life, i have had conflict with one of my sisters due to my adhd symptoms making our personalities very incompatible (she is very focused and sensitive what she perceives as laziness). when i was 12-13 or so, i was dealing with major issues of time management and handling schoolwork. to her, there was no reason for me to be having problems because i was only in the 7th grade and my workload wasn't heavy yet, but to me it felt like i never had enough time. once i came home from school and said hi to heshe took that as proof that i wasn't trying hard enough (don't blame her, she was young and stressed out too, and chores that i didn't have time to get to fell on her). it literally just occurred to me, 8/9 years later, that it was because we have so many problems perceiving the passage of time. i was probably hyperfocusing on what i was doing and 15 minutes felt like nothing. i knew that i had adhd at the time, but at the time i knew little other than ""i zone out in class and forget things."" do you guys have any memories that make so much sense in hindsight after learning about adhd?"

bipolar,depression,17,"i'm in a weird situation. i'm far from being a celebrity, but i have... fans, because of one of my jobs (it's somewhat on the same level as amateur youtuber so nothing too big). i'm also a young illustrator working on a website/portfolio for myself. there is an awful lack of funny, relatable illustration about bipolar disorder (excluding ellen forney of course), and i want to change that. the problem is, if i were to post my bipolar illustrations online, i would have to be open with my fans about my disorder. it would be challenging because i'd have to take on the role of mental health advocate and would probably get asked lot of personal questions. on the other hand, i might be helping people in the ""you're not alone"" kinda way. is it worth it?"

anxiety,depression,19,"i’ve had various forms of anxiety for years, but it’s my anxiety surrounding work that’s giving me the hardest time. i currently work from home as a freelancer (not by choice), and it’s getting harder and harder to keep things in perspective. i get irrationally worried that i’ve made a mistake, and when i do make the inevitable mistake, it feels as if my entire world is falling apart. like i’ve failed in the one thing i still have in my life, and am therefore undeserving of lifeno boss or co-workers to check in on me, i don’t have any impetus to snap out of it. this self-isolation is bad for my mental health (i live alone and have little enough interaction with other humans as it is), and it’s incredibly damaging to my work life. i need advice on how to stop. i’m planning on seeing a therapist as soon as i can afford it—but if i can’t snap out of it first, i won’t ever be able to afford it. has anybody else experienced this? what did/do you do to help?"

ptsd,depression,24,"hello forum, if you are recovering from both cptsd/childhood interpersonal trauma and also substance abuse problems, i highly encourage you to seek help outside of alcoholics anonymous or narcotics anonymous. these two 12-step programs greatly hindered or directly counter-acted my recovery from ptsd stemming from childhood abuse. here is my experience doing the aa/na 12 steps with a sponsor while i was in therapy to recover from childhood abuse trauma. i went to rehab a bit over a year ago, and there i was diagnosed with ptsd stemming from childhood trauma (abusive parents.) my recovery from addiction has necessitated recovery from trauma. professional help has been of vital importance, both individual therapy and group therapy. i did the na/aa programs for a bit, and i found that the 12-steps work greatly reinforced my trauma, and not only was this program ineffective for me, it was detrimental to my recovery from trauma. without successfully navigating my symptoms of trauma and the resultant issues, i would not be able to remain sober. here is how i found the 12-step program of na/aa to actively hinder and directly harm my recovery from trauma: we admitted that we were powerless over our addiction, that our lives had become unmanageable. a.i felt powerless during my child abuse. the overpowering feelings of powerlessness had permeated all other areas of my life. in order to recover from my trauma, i have needed to learn to empower myself, and begin to unravel where all of these feelings of powerlessness in my life stemmed from, and to reclaim my ability to manage my own life in the present. we came to believe that a power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity. a.i understood that i was to find a rescuer, in the form of a higher power, to save me. as a child in an abusive home, i spent the first 18 years of my life desperately hoping someone would swoop in and rescue me, though no one did. this dependency on a rescuer remained with me throughout my adult life as well, as i waited and hoped and searched for another person to save me, but that was not possible and it lead to issues of co-dependency and insecure attachments with others. in order to recover from my trauma, i had to stop seeking out rescuers, and start rescuing myself. we made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of god as we understood him. a.i was never given the freedom to be myself and live my own life and be my own person while living with my abusers, as they took everything i did and said as a personal attack on them and, they reacted violently and angrily towards me for that, which led to so much fear in me in living my own life and expressing my own will due to the repercussions my abusers put on me when i did so throughout my young life. i have had to learn how to express my will and how to live my own life without the fears, or despite the fears, instilled in me from my abusers of potentially bad repercussions. this step reinforced the idea that if i expressed my own will and lived my own life as i saw fit, then i would not really recover, and i would need to live in corate their abuse more gracefully. c.i was told that i was being “selfish” and “self-centered” for removing my abusers from my life, because my distance from my abusive parents was hurting them, and i needed to consider their feelings and my actions that were hurting them. my trauma work, on the other hand, was focused on me beginning to understand that i have worth as a human being, and i am worthy of being treated better by people than my abusers have ever treated me. as such, the focus on my trauma recovery was for me to respect my needs for protection from damaging people. i found the constant iterations and labels of me as selfish and self-centered for hurting my abusive parents through my distance from them, to be hurtful and harmful to what my trauma therapy was working towards. we continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it. a.co-dependency is a massive issue for trauma recovery. i had to learn how to take responsibility for my behavior, but i also had to learn how not to take responsibility for the behavior of others. in trauma recovery, i was most certainly directed away from constantly self-reflecting on myself and finding myself “wrong” and “at fault.” this step, as i saw others apply it, and as i was asked to apply it, focused greatly on putting the responsibility of others’ behaviors onto my own shoulders, and admitting fault when i attempted to erect boundaries to protect myself from emotional harm that others caused me, from time to time. i found that this step greatly reinforced issues of co-dependency. we sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with god as we understood him, praying only for knowledge of his will for us and the power to carry that out. a.while the program preaches “spirituality” instead of religion, i don’t understand why it has become acceptable to push spirituality onto people who may not want spirituality, but rather, recovery. addiction is considered the only “disease” that necessitates spiritual healing; that scientific-based programs and associations, such as the american medical association and various rehabilitation centers, find it acceptable to push spirituality as the cure to issues of mental health, is disconcerting at best. having had a spiritual awakening as a result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to addicts, and to practice these principles in all our affairs. a.i never asked for a spiritual awakening, nor do i want one. i want recovery from my addiction, not a spiritual awakening. in short, if you are recovering from addiction and trauma, please consider professional help of the utmost priority. na/aa are not professional organizations equipped to handle recovery from trauma, and in my experience, participation in that program directly and actively hindered my recovery from trauma. my on-going recovery from trauma has been absolutely necessary to enable me to maintain my sobriety, and my participation in the 12-step programs of aa and na directly contradicted my trauma recovery, and by extension, hindered my chances at addiction recovery as well."
ptsd,depression,25,"it's not the flashbacks, not the dissociation, not the concentration problems. what get me the most is the anger. the urge to scream or to punch walls or just break things even though you know it won't make things better. once it starts, it'so hard to get out of it. i'm normally not an angry person and having such anger inside me really hurts."

adhd,depression,28,"some people like to say that adhd is a gift or a superpower, but i don't really understand why they would put that bus stop so far from the road, and at the same time so far away from the wall behind it. then again, the rest of this four-way crossing is pretty terribly designed, as well. on the other hand, that bus stop was just rebuilt... why didn't they move it? i guess stupid people were in charge... probably the same people that girl looks awfully familiar, was she on tv? well, i guess that wouldn' to write, so it will go fast when i just get going! so i guess there is no rush, really, but i really should get something ready to send to my advisor. i know i should utilize him more and i really need to pause this audio book if i'm not going to pay attention anyway. let's skip back to see where i fell off... have i really been out of it for this long? i should listen a bit to see if i recognize it... ah, okay, this part i remember. should i skip forward again? no, let's just oh crap this is my stop."

adhd,depression,31,"**tl;dr - getting diagnosed allows you to stop blaming yourself and putting yourself down, which eliminates a lot of self-loathing and anxiety, which then allows you to focus on figuring out how to make your life better.** i had a revelation while out walking my dog and i'm going to try and explain it here... i spent more than a decade wondering if i had adhd or if i was just a terrible, lazy, incapable person. i thought i had a good understanding of adhd (boy was i wrong) and concluded that all my troubles were just due to my own shortcomings. i convinced myself that i was incapable of doing as much as other people and that i would never be as good as them. i gave up on dreams. i constantly worried about how i would ever get through life like this. i developed coping mechanisms and achieved success in life, but i was still struggling everyday. about a month ago, i finally decided to see a psychiatrist about my rapidly increasing anxiety. he diagnosed me with adhd and put me on ritalin. things arning it."" --- --- (edit to acknowledge my own advantages and privilege that made it easy for me to get diagnosed, which i realize is not the case for most people. i live in nyc where it is relatively easy to find a doctor, get diagnosed quickly, get medication, and get insurance coverage. i also have incredibly supportive and understanding family, friends, and coworkers. i wish i could help those of you who don't have it so easy, but i'm not familiar with the laws, regulations, and medical practice in other states or countries. my best advice is to convince yourself that you're worthy of a professional opinion, try your hardest to eliminate negative self-talk, be open and honest with those you trust, know when to ask for help or a break, do your research online and with books, and keep fighting to find the right doctor or some way to get treatment. if doctors and medication are out of the question, then research hard and talk to others with adhd so you can figure out strategies to help yourself.)"

bipolar,depression,40,"#lessons learned from 10 years of therapy and 6 years of medication: (tweaked from a comment i made elsewhere on this sub) --------- * **understanding &amp; controlling mood swings**: be mindful of prodromal behavior and focus on using behaviors that lend themselves to the direction you want your symptoms to go. want to be active and stave off depression? drink lots of coffee. want to prevent hallucinations and scary kinds of mania? go to bed early and take melatonin to ensure sufficient sleep. * **learn about symptoms**: for me this meant: take an abnormal psych class, spend dozens and dozens of hours researching medication and treatment options, do enough research on treating bipolar to get published. generally wikipedia, nami, dbsa, and google scholar are your best friends for this. * **recognize moods**: keep a mood tracker and customize it to identify individualized warning signs. watching weeks worth of porn in a single day and barely getting sleep? you might be manic. unsure? come to bipolarreddit and ask for opinions; proceed with caution. [the altman self rating mania is a solid option, too. -------- * **distinguish symptoms from the real you:** realize that symptoms *are a part of the real you* but that you don't have to let them define you. remind yourself that you do what you can to stay in control and that you take responsibility for the mistakes you make that are partially attributable to your disorder. * **identify triggers**: go to therapy religiously and listen when your therapist notices a pattern; keep an eye on your mood tracker. * **improve coping**: trial and error, talk to people with the same problems and hear what works for them; post to bipolarreddit asking how people cope with the same problem. (it turns out you rely heavily on distraction to cope with breakups, which there's *absolutely nothing wrong with*; i'm just hoping to fast-track this and don't think distraction'll facilitate that) ----------- * **avoid things that make you feel worse**: 1. identify what makes you feel worse 2. convince yourself it's important to avoid those things or figure out how not to let tt could be you. i accused my mother of drinking when she was pregnant with me and my girlfriend at the time of keeping me as a mentally deficient pet because i wasn't taking medication for psychosis. seriously, all you need to remember medication is important is to see how much better you feel after a good med change and to read posts from people who aren't taking their meds. * **improve medication consistency**: see the previous bullet point and then get a med tray. bonus points for setting an alarm or generally taking meds the same time every day. -------- * **effectively solve problems**: identify problems and utilize coping skills. ask for help as needed. put effort into maintaining healthy relationships so help is available. * **strengthen stress management skills and healthy habits**: identify poor stress management skills (such as drinking feelings away), identify why those skills get chosen, and come up with substitutes with better outcomes. alcohol makes me depressed? smoke weed when it's available instead. have too many stressors on your plate? find ones you can let go of or de-emphasize. binge eating negative feelings? count calories and come up with foods that give the most good feeling per calorie. decide which health risks are worth taking and which aren't; balance risks with protective factors (e.g. alcohol &amp; exercise). * **make better decisions**: identify poor decisions and factors that led to them. dbt chain analysis is a good option for this. avoid situations that compromise your decision making capacity. get enough sleep, stay in therapy, keep people around you can ask for advice from. * **maintain your gains**: ~~set your calorie counter to weight neutral goals /s~~ go back over your skills periodically, be compassionate with yourself when you fuck up, keep trying, be proactive and honest in managing your medication, stay active in a support group so you get practice going over coping skills for when you need them and so you have help readily available when you need it before you fall too far. hopefully this is helpful to *someone* and not just douchebaggery on my part =/"

none,depression,89,"i moved to switzerland 7 or so months ago and have been trying to see as much of it as possible during my time here. see [this for information on that, and see [this for some pretty pictures, and my submission history for more pictures. very uk based reference system and this is far from complete (and is a little subjective), but hey it is free. i am putting this here mainly for people who search in future (basically as a what i would liked to have found when i was looking into moving here.) and will probably edit this as thoughts come i have covered pretty much every area of the country to some degree, other than graubünden which is my next target once the spring comes. as it is so small and easy to get around the country i have mostly travelled as weekend trips rather than longer ones. it is as pretty a country as i have ever been to, very clean, very easy to get to anywhere you want, culturally pretty varied and probably has the highest density of interesting places worth going to. if you can get over the prices, and the annoying fact that the power plugs are different to the standard european ones. i will steadily update this as more thoughts come to mind. anything that is wrong or you want to ask about give me a shout. **useful websites** in general google the area you are going to. everywhere is well covered with local websites and information on what to do. - very very useful. vast amounts of information on everything from events, hiking routes, museums, towns and just about anything else. is actually rather crap at the moment. many interesting places are missing, others are almost empty and the linked information is pretty lacking (playing around i found it hard to stumble across places i know exist). yes i know it is a wiki and i can fix this but there is vast amounts that needs doing, and editing it in an objective and proper rather is rather dull. go to for routes and times taking in every form of transport. trains, buses, boats, mountain railways and cable cars. detailed map of footpaths with additional details of the official walking/biking/skating/canoeing routes. there is an app you can download with the map and routes, but the map can only be downloaded if you subscribe, still you can see the route and your spot on it with gps which has helped me a few times. topographical maps. with thanks to /u/balancejunkie. use the sidebar to add layers like hiking routes. [atlas user created list of interesting and unique places. zoom in and refresh on each area as it doesn’t show everything whilst zoomed out. for the jura and area. good for ideas of where to go in a less well known area, but it is mostly trying to push money spending experiences, and is absurdly self-promoting even for a tourism website ([i refuse to believe the quote in this was written by anyone but the website of an english writer living in switzerland, with lots of interesting places covered maps and info on a number of hikes webcams from all over the country (and world) help judge the weather and snow levels. just check the date is right, some show views from years ago. fairly high res 360 degree webcams from a number of scenic spots. **time** no city is very big (even zurich the most populous city is in the same municipal population region as cardiff and belfast) and you can see most of the places worth seeing in a city in a single day easily. unless you are a massive fan of museums and architecture then spending days just in a city will get boring fast once you have walked around the old town for the 20th time. depending on how long you have i suggest planning to either keep moving from place to place (not too bad given the short travel times here), base yourself somewhere for longer and do trips out, or a mix of the two. **touristyness** quite a few people seem put off by the popularity and fear they won’t be able to move for tourists. which to a degree is true, but only in a very small number of places and only in small parts of them. just walking a few minutes away from a certain corner of an old town or a cable car station can easily put you alone in a wonderful place. try and walk through the lakeside end of the old town in luzern and you will be fighting for room to move, go to the far end with the real historic bridge and climbable walls and you will have far more space. likewise stand atop rigi (the most visited peak) and you will be surrounded by vast numbers of people. yet walk up from weggis on the mark twain trail and you will only see a few people until you reach the tram stops at the top. head into the jura or quieter parts of the alps and odds are you will only see locals, and often you may hardly see anyone in many areas. **tourist ideals and reality** st bernard dogs. nevermind that they have been bred into a large impractical size since their glory days, and have not been used in mountain rescue for over 60 years. there are stuffed st bernard toys of various sizes in every tourist shop in the country. yet after 6 months of intensive travelling i have yet to see a single real one anywhere. [the original dog ‘barry’ can be seen in the bern natural history if you really want to see one that isn’t filled with stuffing the society for them at martigny or the st bernard hospice in the summer seems to be the only sure-fire way. picture perfect. old towns are everywhere. no (real) wars and more sane (but not always, see the grey box in rigi kaltbad and the metropole hotel in interlaken) town planners mean that pretty much every urban settlement has a nicely preserved old town. there are endless wooden cabins in the alps with mountain backdrops. however there is lots of light industry around so almost everywhere including even the most famous villages have at least one workshop. so it isn’t literally perfect chocolate box (even if it is very close sometimes). hydroelectric power plants and power lines are scattered around many mountain areas which takes away from the ambience a bit sometimes. cow bells. i assumed it was a tourist gimmick these days. nope. almost every cow has them, even on small fields next to or in villages. it is amazing how far the sound carries (which is of course the point of them), it has taken me minutes to realise the clear dings i can hear are from the tiny dots i can barely make out far below. the novelty can wear off sometimes if you are walking and have 5 hours of constant dinging around you. **opening hours** something that catches people off guard is that shops barely stay open. typical shop and supermarket opening hours are 8am-6:30pm on weekdays, possibly closed at 5pm on a saturday, and not open at all on a sunday. on sundays small towns turn into ghost towns, tourist cities feel more like museums, and almost every shop is closed. this is not so bad in tourist towns like interlaken and zermatt where tourist money keeps everything open for longer hours. shops in or next to train stations are a lifesaver and stay open until 10pm everyday. depending on where you are this may be a well stocked coop or migro, or a small and expensive avec. restaurants and bars stay open surprisingly late in many places. sometimes much later than you would expect from even small towns. but not always. religious, national, and canton specific pepper the calendar and can be a real pain as the already barely open shops will shut down some more. these can fall on any day of the week (the swiss pick a date and stick to it), turning a normal day into a sunday which can come as a nasty surprise if you are not planning ahead. and given that each canton is different you are not likely to be doing so. train station shops remain open as do many restaurants and takeaways y a ticket and then just show an inspector on whatever train you take when they come around (no station barriers here which is rather nice). there are some complications with some regional routes giving you 1.5 hours to use any transport in the zones before the ticket expires. some lines have a self check where you must validate your ticket on the platform. this is not as obvious as it should be until you get on the train and see all the yellow stickers with a big 100chf fine warning. the validation boxes are orange and oddly discrete. buses have screens with the next few stops shown, as do many trains. often these will show the connecting trains and platforms as you arrive into stations. connecting trains will be announced as you arrive at major stations on inter-city trains, though not always in every language. trains can be relied on to always go from the same platform too. the swiss sit on trains like electrons filling atomic orbitals. always sit as far away from the nearest person as possible. if you have to sit next to someone or in their 4 seat area a quick ask or questioning glance of is it free is always polite. annoyingly given the high levels of tourism there are almost no big luggage racks on most trains. even the ones that run through both zurich and geneva airports. though you can get medium size bags in the gaps between seats. overhead racks tend to be fairly small, not that the overhead racks get used much anyway, standard swiss protocol is to always put your bag on the seat next to you until someone asks if they can sit there. [see the start of this video for the perfect you shouldn’t even consider moving from your seat until the train is literally stopping. if you jump up as soon as the next stop is announced you will find yourself stood by the doors alone for a few minutes while all the swiss remain sat down. well unless it is a touristy area in which case you and a gaggle or other travellers will be stood up for the amusement of the swiss. it isn’t perfect, delays can happen (often blamed on a deutschbahn train) and it can fully cock up with a loss of power other reasons bringing the whole thing to a halt. but generally it runs very well. **a few random points** fasnacht: happening around the start of february in catholic cantons (and a bit later in basel) this involves costumes, confetti and marching bands. interesting to see the swiss go crazy, but once you have seen 1 hour of fasnacht you have kind of seen most of it really. so unless you are a part of the community and are actively involved it can get old quite fast. especially with the music. smoking pipes: people do it in a serious non-ironic-hipster way. health insurance forms even ask if you smoke 20 cigs or 5 pipes a day. alp means high meadow, not literally just mountain as you might think. which is why many places called blahalp are only half way up the mountain above blah village. in the autumn the flatland tends to be under fog all day everyday. [this is very impressive when seen from but gets rather depressing down below. try and avoid this time of year. switzerland has snakes. poisonous ones too! and they can live up to 2000m up! though seeing one is very rare the swiss love to have little cooking fires when they are walking. fire sites are obvious everywhere and around midday the woods and countryside will often have a smoky smell. the swiss love to swim in rivers and lakes in the summer. even in the cities, like the centre of basel you will see people floating through the city centre and zipping past barges on the rhein. the water is almost always clear and inviting no matter where you are. but do check it is safe first, there are lots of fast flowing and dangerous places. given their famous love of order the swiss don’t really do queuing as you might expect. getting onto buses and trains tends to be a ruly mob rather than proper queues. nobody is going to force you out of the way, but they are unlikely to stop and wave you forward first. gently moving forward without pushing or giving ground too easily seems to be the way to go. **military** it is very strange knowing that conscription is in place for young men (though they can choose to do community service instead of the army, but with more hours to perform). and in some ways just as strange when you realise there are (almost) no war memorials which are an ever-present part of every uk and anzac community. signs of the army are everywhere and it can almost feel a bit like a prosperous happy north korea at times. at weekends it is common to see soldiers heading home on friday evening from military service and returning on a sunday (not normally with guns, i have only seen a few so far on trains), and the odd armoured convoy driving around. bunkers greet you in mountain passes. by far the most impressive is on the top of mt pilatus which looks like a bond villain base. every house or area comes with a nuclear bunker (normally filled with the family ski gear and wine). during military service conscripts have to do a certain amount of target practice so gun ranges are everywhere, straddling fields, and clinging to awkward cliffsides in the mountains. look carefully and you will often see the numbered targets lined up as you move around the country. **entertainment** gigs are rather expensive. twice the price or more of what i would expect for the venue size and band compared to the uk. do not come here just to see a band. films in the german part often have a 10 minute intermission halfway through the screening (i may have been born too late but thanks to switzerland i can still sort of experience life in the 1960s). a surprising amount of swiss music is played on pop stations, in both local and english languages. i only recently realised that loads of songs on the radio that i assumed were american/british worldwide hits were actually local bands singing in english. a few swiss artists are [anna **reading** swiss watching - diccon bewes. switzerland seen through british eyes. an intro to the history, people, politics and areas of the country. ideal reading as a traveller. slow train to switzerland - diccon bewes. the author retraces the first thomas cook tour of switzerland and shows how much has changed since then and by the rise of trains and tourism. interesting read for the history and travel ideas. free [a tramp abroad - mark satirical and absurd account of his travels in europe. the swiss part is often hilarious. as above is interesting to see just how much the country has changed since then. several places such as weggis-rigi and riffleberg have theme walks in the approximate places where he walked himself. a tramp in this sense is to walk, not the homeless person as most people other than the kiwis might assume. la place de la concorde suisse - john mcphee. dated but interesting read looking at swiss military thinking and culture back in the 80s. free [sherlock holmes - the final problem - arthur conan quick and easy read of holmes' ""final"" adventure. he oversells the waterfall somewhat though i must say. bill bryson passes through in his 1991 book “neither here nor there” though while still a good read the info is a bit outdated in parts. not sure how he managed to see sion as being a charmless industrial town. the magic mountain - thomas mann. inspired by and set in a davos mountain health retreat. no comment as have yet to read it. heidi of course for kids, which seems to be something of cliché and sales-device these days. **a few thoughts on places** [see this comment and the ones after it for some, but far from all of the places i have been. i will probably post a more thorough post on this at a later time.]("

ptsd,depression,108,"last year i was went home with someone who became very rough partway through sex. i didn't want to be there anymore and i found myself completely zoned out emotionally, almost as if watching what was happening through a looking glass. i become hyper performative even as i was internally screaming, just to get it over with faster. i found out later from my therapist i started seeing after, that i may have ptsd and that what i experienced was dissociation. she told me that i probably wouldn't have dissociated if this person hadn't done something that was enough to make me feel unsafe and therefore not to blame myself. but i struggle all the time with the thought that i was assaulted because i dissociated. sex with her. i wanted it to end. i remember at one point doing something that got her off of me. but then after that i remember snippets of me performing. i wasn't speaking. but i continued to go along with the sex - like living out the motions. but i know for a fact i didn't want it. and i remember feeling like i didn't want it even while it was happening. i'm wondering if i might have dissociated again. and if anyone else experiences this. experienced increased trauma and harm from a coping mechanism that supposedly is supposed to deal with harm. how do you all deal with it? how do i learn to say no and remove myself from situations i don't want to be in if i dissociate before i even have the chance?"

ptsd,depression,117,"i saw someone post about ptsd becoming more pronounced during holidays and birthdays, or something along the lines that ptsd was the reason they were so emotional around christmas etc? i was just wondering, is anyone else in the same boat and can explain why this occurs, or how to deal with it?"
anxiety,depression,118,"i haven't beat my anxiety, and i don't think that is ever possible. it's important to understand that anxiety is natural, and everyone experiences it; anxiety is a human emotion and it is natural to feel it. for some of us, it can be detrimental to our life however. i apologize if there are any grammatical or spelling errors. tl;dr: eat varied vegetables, exercise everyday, meditate, detach yourself from mental clutter, be aware of your drug intake, pay attention to the moment, engage in flow, seek anxiety and confront it. **nutrition** you are what you eat. if you are neglecting your diet you are neglecting your mind. personally, i have had a lot of success by implementing certain foods and being aware of the effect that these foods have on my body. tl;dr: eat vegetables, supplement magnesium ,abstain from caffeine or supplement l-theanine, learn about your gut microbiome, consume less sugar and eat more vegetables, consume sufficient fats. * magnesium: magnesium relaxes the body and helps contribute to a healthy electrolyte balance. personally, i noticed a severe reduction in my tremors and baseline anxiety level once i started to supplement magnesium glycinate. * caffeine: this appears to be obvious, but i feel like a lot of people do not think about this. excessive caffeine levels increase the amount of mental noise i have, which results in higher levels of anxiety. * l-theanine: a natural amino acid that is found in green tea. if you do choose to consume caffeine, combine 200mg theanine with your caffeine dosage to help combat any anxiety. also works splendidly as a study aid. * gut microbiome: i am not going to pretend to thoroughly understand this complicated system. but, from my understanding we have a second ""brain"" in our stomach. the bacteria that we choose to feed within our stomach has a feedback system, which fuels certain cravings and can change our mental state. this is why your anxiety may peak after a round of anti-biotics, you have eliminated all the bacteria in your stomach, and if you eat a diet rich in sugars or simple carbs you will have fed the bad bacteria. if your gut is populated by these bad bacteria, it will have repercussions on your mental health. * microbiome practical advice: consume more fiber and vegetables to feed good bacteria. consume more probiotics rich foods such as kimchi, kefir, saurkraut, and kombucha. favoid simple carbohydrates such as sugars, white bread, etc. avoid alcohol. consider supplementing a probiotics, examine.com is a fantastic resource to find the right supplement for you. **lifestyle** tl;dr: exercise . * you are not your thoughts: your thoughts are not completely true and are built upon heuristics. just because you believe that your coworkers are talking about you, this does not make it true. our brains are incredible, but they are oftentimes inaccurate. * mindfulness: again, the goal is to dwell less in our brains, and focus more on the present moment. there is no past or future, the only thing that truly exists is the present moment. when your anxiety is peaking, take time to focus on the sensation of your breath, rub your fingers together and be aware of the feeling, do anything that grounds you with your physical sensation. * watch your brain: take the time every day to just let your brain think. don't try to control your thoughts or empty your brain, just wait and see what your next thought will be. if it is negative, don't reject the thought. follow the thought as far as your mind wants to, and move on when you notice another thought arise. again, this creates a barrier between you and your mind. * flow: have you ever played a game where you are completely in the moment? maybe the ball was just thrown to you, and your body seems to react automatically. this is flow, and it is a important part of our mental well-being. you can achieve this state through many different activities, take the time to find the ones that you can find flow in. **the importance of fear**: courage isn't the absence of fear, but the ability to recognize your fear and act anyway. by engaging in activities that give you anxiety, you will find that your anxiety is often times unfounded. this sounds difficult, but honestly the best thing you can do with your anxiety is to push yourself. take baby steps, don't jump into the deep end. you will be controlled by your anxiety if you don't push the levels a bit. if you have social anxiety, start talking more online. make small talk with the cashier. find whatever baby steps work for you. **therapy**: you are not weak if you consult a therapist. please, if you are really struggling go and try to talk to some different therapists. they are generally wonderful people who just want you to live a happy, fulfilled life. **recommended reading:** siddhartha by herman hesse meditations by marcus aurelius the power of now by eckhart tolle the subtle art of not giving a fuck by mark manson the slight edge by jeff olson the feeling good handbook by david burns. these are some of the things that have helped me, hopefully you find something that can help you as well. if you have any suggestions or something that you would like to comment on, please do."
anxiety,depression,119,"i am seriously over the moon right now! this is my dream job and i can't believe i scored it! i followed the advice y'all gave me after my last interview and had a ""fake it till you make it"" approach to all interactions with this employer. i made dog puns in my first e-mail, joked a bit on the phone, and made the whole process fun for myself (which, it turns out, mam baths!). i feel the complete *opposite* of what i felt going into that second interview at last week. in every way. i'm confident, too... that's rare for me. thanks, anxiety. seriously, though... thank you, r/anxiety! i approached this opportunity today using the tips and advice you gave me... and it worked beautifully! i start tomorrow at 11 am. wish me luck!!! :d"

anxiety,depression,121,i've been convinced i must have heart disease because i can hear/feel a flutter/pounding in pretty much every beat of my heart. it is there pretty much all day everyday to some degree. it's particularly bad when i am resting/sitting in bed. it is beated to ocd and being hyperaware of my body. it is really just a hell i cannot escape and it is really motivating me to take serious action to improve my anxiety. i need to learn to relax. anyone experienced anything similar/been able to overcome it?
anxiety,depression,122,backlash or not keep those comments to yourself. unless you want to keep your account keep those fucking thoughts to yourself. had enough of seeing that shit today. it’s disgusting.
bipolar,depression,123,"i don't even know where to begin. i can barely hold my phone in my hands but these thoughts have to get out. i'm seeing signs that my mental health is suffering. i don't even want to talk about the flood anymore. i dont want to talk about my house, the work on my house, the everything. i'm so damn tired. i have eaten maybe 4 times since this all started. i've been working sun up-sun down on my house, with no luck in finding a contractor to help. yesterday was my birthday. i spent it gutting my walls and packing the few things we have left. i'm ""taking the day off"" to celebrate today... and i don't even want to. i can't sleep or eat. all i can do is stare at the wall and wonder what the actual fuexhausted. i'm mostly just depressed. actually since this started i've been episodic. right now my brain is running 10x its normal pace and i'm shaking and thinking all of these crazy thoughts and at the same time i'm numb and dont want to move or talk or eat or anything. every single day since this started i've lied in bed at night thinking how much i dont want to wake up. then when i wake up in the morning i start crying immediately when it all comes rushing back that this is my reality; this is my piss poor excuse for a human existence. fuck. i'm all over the damn place right now. thanks for reading, if you have. i'm not asking for a thing. i just needed to vent this out. i guess wish me luck."
adhd,depression,124,"i can write it down, doesn't matter, there's always something i'll forget to write down, something obvious i didn't foresee. i prepared all my clothes and books for the morning? well, i forgot to turn on my alarm. woops! i did all my homework? well, i left it at home! just now? my room is a mess. bad. i had to shower before leaving the apartment. so, to make sure i didn't mess up, i planned ahead to make sure nothing wouldn't go wrong after the shower. got all my clothes together. perfect! get out of the shower. socks are missing. i forgot that i need to wear socks. i'm anxious, but no big deal. i have to put on deodorant. well, haha, sucks for me because i did not consider that i would need deod: i needed my hoodie the other night. i could swear i put my hoodie in the laundry, but i only had my roommates hoodie, which i didn't want to get dirty cuz i was borrowing it. i just noticed my hoodie in the dryer i'm not the only one who's this bad, am i? this is adhd, right? it scares the shit out of me. edit: i am incapable of speed-reading, i have tried it, it requires my brain to focus on too many tasks at once so the information doesn't stick (reading and comprehending), appreciate the suggestion but my problem is not that im a slow reader, my problem is not being able to pay attention to what i read, drifting off, and forgetting what i just read, and this is made way worse by speed reading"
anxiety,depression,125,"get off the phone, get off twitter, get off the computer, get off reddit, turn off the news, get off whatever you gotta. do whatever you got to to avoid the fear mongers and to keep yourself calm. throughout the syria bombing a while back and this i’ve found that being on the internet makes it worse and people go into hysterics over nothing. get off here and go for a drive, go shopping, go do something to get your mind off of it. turn off all the bad stuff that’s pushing you down and go out and get some fresh air."
anxiety,depression,126,sometimes i feel like i don't have a personality beyond the anxiety. i've been anxious my whole life. there are so many things that i can't do because of this fucking disorder. it makes me feel so fucking hopeless.
bipolar,depression,127,i've been struggling to rationalize myself right now. i have thoughts to hurt or kill myself. or walk for hundreds of miles. that my family and friends hate me that they are judging me and laughing behind my back. i feel like i constantly have to reassure myself that these perceptions aren't real. i have coursework i'm doing for an online course i really want to pass. i don't want to fail.fail.fail.fail.fail. i don't know how to control this my speech is being affected by this either too fast or slow and slurred. this anxiety has to stop now.
adhd,depression,128,"anyone else here just hate brushing their teeth? i’m almost convinced this is an adhd thing. my teeth look like shit as a result of 3 years of neglect. i️ don’t know why i️ hate it i️ just see it as a burden rather than a necessity. how did you guys fix this bad habit? edit: after reading these, my best bet would be to get an electric toothbrush and get some mouthwash which i’ll use twice a day. thank you everyone for your suggestions. another thing would just be to do it in the shower because it’s the most productive thing you can do besides sitting there."
adhd,depression,129,"so i had this professor who always used to say ""never be afraid to make me repeat myself. i'll repeat as many times as necessary"". he used to say it so much that i really did think he'd be cool with it, cause i did want him to repeat a lot of times because i wasn't able to pay attention and tended to zone-out while he was teaching. so i started asking him to repeat himself, a few times in the entire class, until he told me not do it anymore cause he thought i was a troll. he also then stopped saying anyone could repeat him."
anxiety,depression,130,"i have no one else really to share this with, so bear with me. for the last few months i've been scared to go into my bathroom. i don't know about you guys, but for me, my anxiety starts off small and then spirals without me noticing until i'm so deep in i don't know how to get out. the bathroom started off just messy, you know when life gets busy and you're like, i'll just get all that hair later. until the drain clogs. and it's not so bad, clogged drain whatever. you buy stuff to unclog the drain but the packaging sits in there for a week too longe drain. i got rid of every bottle, every old hair tie. i sprayed and rinsed the shower until the soap scum was gone. i changed the lightbulbs and scrubbed the sink and the vanity. i was shaky and sweaty but i did it and it's clean! it's not perfect. i need to wash towels and go through the cabinets. but you know what, i'm not afraid to go back in there and shower tonight. that's fucking huge. it stirred up anxiety about the way the rest of my house looks. i've got a lot of work ahead of me. but i accomplished something today. and that's not nothing."

bipolar,depression,134,"cw: alcohol cravings. i've been dry for nine months (gave up alcohol for new year, and actually stuck to it!). the thing is, i feel like i was better off when i was drinking every day and getting blackout drunk at least once a week. it was quitting drinking that catapulted me into a manic episode earlier this year, which led to my diagnosis, based on that and ssive (it would make me feel better) or manic (i want to get smashed and go crazy). maybe both? i haven't had this strong of a craving since i first quit. i know it's not a good idea. i know. i know how badly it would fuck up everything i've done. but damn, i want a drink. someone please tell me not to do it? i really don't want to destroy everything i've done."
ptsd,depression,135,"hey all. i recently started dating this man. he is absolutely incredible. he’s gentle and sweet, he’s so smart and he makes me laugh. he suffers from ptsd pretty badly however. i have no experience with this at all. i want to make our relationship work and last but i’m at a loss on how sad man. he works in the police force and spent some time in the military also. so basically, i’m looking for any advice on how to nurture this relationship properly and make sure he’s comfortable with me. also, anything i should be aware of. thank you for taking the time to read this."
adhd,depression,136,"idk about you guys, but sometimes if i'm complaining about how i've been procrastinating with something that needs to get done or worrying about not finishing things because my adhd makes it impossible to 'just do it' and i keep putting off things till kingdom come, people will say this to me and its *so frustrating.* i wish it were that simple, that i could just get up and get things done  those comments doesn't help. i just finding hearing those words and ""just do it."" or ""just get it done with already."" to be really stifling. i avoid complaining to people about my inability to just do things anymore just because i know they might say this while not meaning any harm, but it still manages to slip its way into my every day. is this frustrating for other people too, or just me?"
anxiety,depression,137,"i don't post on here a whole lot, but when it's really bad i come read your stories. my anxiety is extremely physical. my hands and forehead go numb, i grind my teeth, sharp head aches and blurry vision. i've had two ekg's because i thought i was having a heart attack or a stroke. we all express it in different ways, but it helps me so much just knowing that i'm not alone. i'm not saying i'm happy that you guys also feel bad, i'm just saying it reminds me that i'm human. so yeah. you guys have unknowingly pulled me out of countless full blown panic attacks, and i am more grateful for that than i could possibly say."
ptsd,depression,138,"this is my very first reddit post. i've been dealing with my ptsd for almost fifteen years now, and i've been diagnosed for about five. my story might be triggering, and for that i apologize. but my message is one of wellness and hope. i spent the night at my cousin's house approximately a week before my seventh birthday. she had begun abusing me pretty steadily earlier that year, but that's another story entirely. we had eaten our dinner and were trying to get a movie started while my aunt, uncle and older cousins chatted around the dinner table. i don't want to make this story too long, or too triggering, so for what happened next - i'm going to try and just give the details as bluntly and without emotion as possible. six armed gunmen broke in. it was a robbery that somehow just went wrong. maybe they didn't think we would be there, or maybe they didn't care. i'm not sure. my cousins and i fled upstairs while my aunt and uncle tried to fight them off. we barricaded ourselves inside a bedroom. the four of us huddled on the bed, repeatedly calling the police. we could hear muffled shouts and scuffling from downstairs. then we heard a gunshot. my aunt screamed. and everything went silent. in the silence, we could hear a dragging. though we didn't know it at the time, my uncle had been struggling with one of the gunmen when his weapon went off. my uncle was stunned, the shot having gone off right by his ear. though he hadn't been hit, his assailant took the opportunity to beat my uncle unconscious. they tied my aunt up in a room and dragged my uncle in too. then they locked the door, and came upstairs for us. they hadn't been able to find the money or goods they wanted. they started pounding o going to murder us) would come for us all. i told them they should have just let me ""do it"" so i could save them. my dad was crying. he tried to approach me and something snapped. i didn't recognize him. i collapse, sobbing and begging for my life. i didn't see the dad that had lovingly raised me and given my brothers and i big kid ice cream cones when my mom was out of town. i saw an assailant. i begged my dad not to hurt me, not realizing who he was. my parents sought help for me immediately. i was quickly diagnosed with ptsd, ocd, generalized anxiety and depression. with a name to my condition, it all began to make sense. i had nightmares. i was hyper vigilant. i wouldn't be alone with men. i assessed escape routes wherever i was. i'm sure these are things you all are familiar with. we weren't sure if i would graduate high school, go to college, or ever be able to live alone. a lot has happened in the past five years. for the sake of keeping things short, i'll sum it up like this. i now attend a prestigious university and am preparing to apply to graduate programs so i can earn my phd. i have a wonderful boyfriend who i've been seeing for around a year now. i live alone and fend for myself. i am alive. and most days - i am not afraid. not every day is a good day. sometimes i can't leave my apartment. i can't watch horror movies. i don't like going anywhere alone at night. and loud sounds spook me. but i'm going to be okay. sometimes, i know it doesn't feel like it. no one understands the way we think, the threats we see, the memories that won't die. but we can heal. we can be okay. some days, maybe it's enough to know we aren't alone. so i just wanted to say - here i am. you aren't alone."
ptsd,depression,139,"**his response copy-pasted: “i’m sorry for all of it. i wish there’s something i could do to help but if this is what you need i understand. i hope things work out for you.”** my ex best friend of two years was drunk one night and raped me in my sleep. he had tried to have sex while we were falling asleep and i said no, and i woke  to help?? help what?? you raping me? judging by this weird response i don’t think i ever knew him. this sounds like something a sociopath would say. it sounds like he’s not acknowledging what he did, like it’s just some off-hand robotic message. fake sympathy for somebody you don’t know. i’m appalled and disgusted even more in him."

bipolar,depression,149,"recently this week i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. i’ll admit, before i had the correct knowledge about the disorder, i always thought it was just mood swings. that’s someone could be easily triggered with anger or sadness like a flip of a light switch. i was wrong. it made me open my eyes to what’s truly wrong with me. i’ve always wonder for years after years on why other depressed to scare the fuck out of me. like going to medical school, getting a house of my own, actually opening up and getting help. but now i achieved those things. i graduated medical school, i bought my first house, and i finally put my foot down and got some damn help. i will not let this bring me more down. i will over come this. i will become a better person. i will not give up on myself."

ptsd,depression,152,"hi everyone, i'd like to ask for help. i'm a 19 year old female. growing up, my parents were emotionally/verbally abusive. my brother was physically violent to me. he would still have several angry outbursts today. my two aunts who stayed with us were also such angry people. i'm the youngest in the family. most of the times, i never fight back since i never wanted to be as angry/violent as them. during the times that i opened up about how they treated me, they immediately dismissed it and called me selfish. entering college, i only get to see my family once a week. i developed certain habits from the trauma i got from my household. because of how they treated me, i often get anxious for standing up for myself. my first kiss wasn't consensual. my close passed, he sexually abused me several times. he would apologize, then do so again. i will not go into details with the other sexual things he did since this is all i could talk about without breaking down. we broke up in 2018. i'm currently not seeing a therapist atm, but will do so again next month once i save up some money. i'm in my third year of university and i do freelance graphic illustration part-time so i don't really get as much. can anyone recommend other ways for me to cope while i'm not in therapy? i've been getting nightmares and intrusive thoughts again. i'm mostly scared these days. all this trauma i got from different events makes me feel so weak. one of my harassers also contacted me. idk what to do. i'm scared of not getting better."
ptsd,depression,154,"i was diagnosed with ptsd 2 days go. i have been living with ptsd since the trauma occurred when i was 9. and man, do i have a lot on my mind! i'd love to be able to talk about just everything, but i'm not quite ready to be that open. however there is something i do want to say. i'm going to be ok. now that i'm diagnosed, for the first time in my life i feel like everything will be ok because i will finally have people who understand me. yes, things are going to be hard. but on the bright side, they've already been as worse as they possibly can! holy hell i'm still alive after 13 years of living with undiagnosed ptsd! look at me fucking go! i'm going to be ok because not only can i believe in myself now, but i also will never be as alone as i feel."
adhd,depression,155,ever since i can remember i've always been an extremely curious person and if i ever overheard someone talking about something like a secret or drama i would be dying to know what they were talking about and beg them to let me know too. right now i find myself absolutely torturing myself over my ex girlfriends in i grew to be such a manipulative person. so am i just nosey or you guys like this too? i also hate hate hate when someone starts to tell me something then says never mind and cuts it off. it can literally ruin the rest of my day if they refuse to tell me what they were gonna say (until i forget about it at least)
bipolar,depression,158,"so i have known for a long time i have suffered from depression and anxiety. i mean if you check my posts history you can see that. i find myself frequently depressed, to the point of wanting to just end things (however won't for a myriad of reasons). i also find myself anxious beyond belief about certain things. i was told for years that i had both depression and anxiety. nothing more, nothing less. i have had manic episodes, and when i am on go, i am on go, but i am good at looking stoic and being ""normal"" on the outside. if that makes sense? howevee down and given me exams or anything but has suggested it for years. my therapist even was on the boarder about it for a while. i am sure my mom has it too, albeit far more showing? so yeah, here we are! rather here i am in my early 30s and finally things click. however, it is scary. like i don't know what comes next? will this diagnosis impact my life negatively and adversely? will i have to disclose it, or hide it from my job? i don't know. it is ironically depressing in of it self. but we shall see what the future holds. anyway, thanks for reading!"

adhd,depression,178,"sorry, this is long. so, just like the title says, i cleaned my room yesterday. i mean, i really cleaned it. it was disorganized and always messy and it had been driving me nuts for probably a year. i made a deal with my husband that every saturday we would choose one area of the house and purge it and really scrub it. we've lived in our house for 6years and we neaten it here and there, clean it up better when company comes, but we've never really gone room by room and sorted everything and purged all the old stuff and scrubbed the corners and walls and stuff. so this is pretty embarrassing, but i normally use natural cleaners for everything except the toilet and i've never really scrubbed everything hard- just surface cleaning here and there to get it a step above unsanitary and gross. yesterday i broke out the big guns and used an entire brand new can of scrubbing bubbles just on my makeup counter and toilet/shower area (our house was built in the 70's and our sink is in our bedroom opposite another counter vanity for make up, and the toilet and shower are in a tiny little room with a pocket door). you guys, i dusted everything, scrubbed the window frames, washed the windows, cleaned our lampshades inside and out including the bulbs. i scrubbed all the baseboards, washed and reorganized my medicine cabinet shelves and cabinet drawers, sctackling their bedrooms. little by little we're going to make our way through the whole house and de-clutter and organize it. it's such a daunting task, but just knowing how good it feels to get it done is huge motivation! i'm also trying to not berate myself for letting it get so bad. cleaning is probably my least favorite activity ever, but i feel so good when things are picked up and cleaned. i know it's better for my mental health and feeling in control, too. more motivation to get rid of a lot of extra crap taking up room in my life! tl;dr-cleaned my room and it was much worse than i'd realized. motivated to keep the momentum going and get the rest of the house in order. edit:: i thought i should give an update! it has been three weeks and my room is still clean! i can't even believe it, but it is!!! dh and i both also clean all three of our kids rooms and i cleared up a lot of launfry today. i can't even begin to tell you how motivating it is to get this done. i think i've reached a point where i actually want to clean things up because of how nice it feels! we still have some pretty major sections of the house to work our way through and it will be a chore to get the kids to be more cognizant of their rooms, but after three saturdays of committing to this it feels like i'm almost at the stage of making it a new normal! *happy dance!*"

bipolar,depression,218,"since being 'in recovery' i've been thinking about this a lot. hypomania for me was predominantly a good thing - it made me smarter, driven, sociable and funnier. more importantly it allowed me to accomplish a lot of things in short spaces of time that would have been unlikely otherwise. that's not to say that i didn't often embarrass myself (although i rarely cared) or jump from one obsession to another. i was always able to convince people that what i was doing was rational and achievable. other people usually got swept up in it too. when i changed psychiatrists two and a half years ago he asked me to describe hypomania to confirm my diagnosis. i described the more vivid colours, strong sense of fate, louder sounds, enhanced scents, little need for eating or sleep, bright coloured sparks and sometimes faint music. i gave a recent example of walking through the centre of a town on a sunny day and hearing music that wasn't playing and feeling like everything was perfectly connected. he said he'd only ever heard people describe it that way when they were about to stop taking their meds. so now i'm stable to the point where he thinks i won't have significant episodes ld to moderate hypomania without the depressive or mixed episodes. i didn't inherit the extended family's alcoholic gene though i'm almost addicted to being up. anyway, since i sometimes don't realise when i'm being irrational i read a few interesting articles about hope versus delusion. mainly in terms of tefl and other ambitions. this is the most relevant: ""delusions are beliefs about the current state of the world. hopes are future-oriented."" and pro-hypomania: ""the findings are published in the british journal of psychiatry. they suggest that mania may improve intellectual and academic performance, accounting for the link with ""genius"". people with mild mania are often witty and inventive, appearing to have ""enhanced access to vocabulary, memory and other cognitive resources"". they tend to have exaggerated emotional responses which may ""facilitate their talent in art, literature or music"". in a manic state individuals have ""extraordinary levels of stamina and a tireless capacity for sustained concentration""."" lately i've had several ambitions that come and go like a bad radio signal. as in i want to start a blog or write a book, then i switch to another fixation."

none,depression,224,"hi everyone! first things first. a bit of background: having been studying english for almost seven years, i passed cae in 2015 and subsequently passed cpe in 2018 (got a). after the proficiency exam, i managed to create some sort of language bubble around me. i have at least six hours of speaking practice weekly. i keep learning some new words and expressions. i read for at least an hour every day. i am an avid writer. i dabble with poetry and short stories (i post some on reddit and elsewhere). perhaps it may sound sacrilegious to some, but i don't really see c2 as some kind of pinnacle. i reached it a while ago. since then, i seem to have somewhat improved my writing (which, in t also feels like you've reached a plateau and now you're crawling rather than leapfrogging towards some new level. and that's fine. i'm going to retake this exam this year or maybe next year, just to keep my language alive and kicking. i put too much time and effort into it, and it would be too profligate of me to lay it all to waste. what do you think, folks? your opinions are welcome. nb. i am working as a chemical engineer. there's not much opportunity for me to apply my english at work, let alone at a level that high. i participate in and contribute to some local off-line speaking clubs, but, truth be told, they do not really challenge me. and i want something duly challenging."
none,depression,226,"you don't even know how to find political candidates at the local and municipal level and communicate with those candidates, or campaign for those candidates. you are all so inclined to believe that any efforts you put forth won't matter because comcast and whatever big business can just throw 16 tonnes of money at the problem. you've already been beaten because you don't even have the will to fight. i'll admit it, the big ""movement"" of this generation, the occupy wallstreet camping fluffy feelgood *protest*, was horribly orchestrated, horribly executed, and a horrible example of what to do. your generation needs a rotten stinking mouthpiece. you need a politician. you need to find a candidate, at least one, at every level of your government. if you can't find one, you can create one. honestly, the biggest criticism of this model of politicing is that it ""isn't easy"". no. its not. your ""easy"" methods aren't very effective or at least they haven't been in the last 15 years. people complaining that poor people get the shit end of the stick in terms of politics and how the richest 1% dominates the political scene. it has to do with organization. here is an example of political involvement cross referenced with income stratification : you need to, especially if you are poor and can not find a job, spend time getting politically involved. i'm not talking about spending days/months/weeks at the campaign headquarters. spend 5 hours this month reading your voters pamphlet for this years elections, take note that its a bit too late this year to find somebody that truours monthly to the cause that is 235,200,000 annually. more if you can get more people. ""but third parties..."". nobody mentioned anything about third parties in this discussion of political landscaping. if you can get 2% of people under 30 to pledge that sort of time to one of the national parties at the local level then you can pretty much dictate what candidate is going to be run during the primaries. think of it like your generation is odysseus. its going to take you 10 years to get home (wherever you want to go). now if one of your generation has already done some of the work to organize a political platform that amenable to your generation (here's looking at you seattle) then you probably already have somewhere you can report for duty. i'm not saying its all going to be sunshine and rainbows, but the overarching goals that my generation seems to be very vocal about valuing are achievable, you just have to trek uphill a bit to get there. little things like revoking franchise agreements for isp, telcos, and tv companies that provide them support for a regional monopoly. little things like banning isps that are not classified as title ii common carriers at the state level. once you have the base, for the local, municipal, and state levels taken care of then you can essentially make the federal level your bitch. so yea. i don't think my generation (ages 18-30) has the wherewithal to create a political apparatus, to perform that sort of political landscaping, or to get anything done politically. its not a factor of money, its a matter of boots on the ground."

adhd,depression,269,"i read and responded to a post on this topic yesterday and op from that post recommended that i make my comment a post of its own. after all the times i've been helped by this community, this finally feels like my opportunity to give back. here goes! \*cracks knuckles\* &amp;#x200b; so i've been struggling with this lately myself. i've been wanting to learn the guitar for literally years but never had the money to buy one. now that i have the money to do it i keep getting cold feet and thinking, ""oh man, i know i'm not gonna be able to stick with it so it's not even worth buying."" but f\*ck it. i'm gonna buy it! here's how i came to that decision. &amp;#x200b; **\*\*1. be kind to yourself!\*\*** obviously, #1 universal rule of adhd, applicable to all scenarios. self-loathing sucks. do your best to be kind to yourself. i recently came across the term ""self-compassion"", which i really like. be at least as nice to yourself as you'd be to other people. you wouldn't make fun of/beat up a loved one who switches hobbies often, so don't do it to yourself! &amp;#x200b; **\*\*2. emphasize dynamic hobbies.\*\*** someone in yesterday's thread used the phrase ""dynamic hobbies"" and i think that's a god damn genius phrase. we need hobbies that we can pick up for a month or two at a time and completely forget for another few months. that's just how my/our hobbies work! we just need to accept that and choose compatible hobbies. last month i got *obsessed* with freshwater aquariums. watched a ton of youtube videos, went to petco to scout potential fish, etc. even bought a fancy ass $100+ fish tank from amazon! then i realized that this is \*not\* a dynamic hobby. forgetting/not caring about my aquarium for months will result in dead fish. **\*error 404: incompatible hobby!\*** fish tank was subsequently returned. relatedly, i had a plant in my bedroom that i needed to water every day or few days. that plant is dead as hell. i now have one of those plants that you only need to remember to water once a month (snake plant, if you're wondering!). plant iscan afford it!). example: i've had a regular gym membership for 6 months and literally only gone 1 single time. it's just too much to actually figure out what workouts i am supposed to be doing, keep myself accountable to the time set for each exercise, etc. also tbh it's honestly kind of boring. i signed up for a workout class last week. the only thing i need to do is show up. they already have the exercises planned so i don't need to think about it. and it's a group class so there's constant motivation to push myself from peers. i have exercised 5 times in the last 7 days! that's like an infinity percent improvement from my previous strategy. i would never have gotten there if i was just trying ""harder"" at a strategy that didn't work for me. &amp;#x200b; **\*\* 6. trying new hobbies is a hobby unto itself!\*\*** what is the definition of a hobby? something you do for fun. some people collect stamps for fun. other people watch birds for fun. others make scrapbooks. you know what i do? try new hobbies! i get pleasure from getting excited about a random thing and diving into it a month at a time. trying new hobbies is my hobby! no sense in feeling guilt or shame about it when it makes me so god damn happy! this is a subtle but ***really important*** reframing. person x would say, ""i collect stamps for fun. last year i found a rare limited edition 1956 stamp from montana and a couple from california in the 1760s! i loved it!"" i would say, ""i try new hobbies for fun. last year i dabbled in photography, guitar, and dog sitting! i loved it!"" both of us would be having fun doing what we do. person x would never feel bad about him or herself for not trying ""enough"" new things, so why would i ever feel bad about trying ""too many"" new things?! &amp;#x200b; **\*\*tl;dr:\*\*** be kind to yourself. accept that your hobbies will have to be dynamic. instead of trying harder, consider trying differently. reduce the (financial) barriers to exit. and, most importantly, recognize that trying new hobbies \*is\* a hobby! godspeed, mateys. happy hobbying!"

ptsd,depression,349,"a couple of months ago i signed up on whatsapp and i thought it be real cool to get clear videos. although some videos were funny, people that i thought were my friends started sending me videos of horrible motorcycle accident. it kicked up my ptsd and i started having flashbacks a couple of times a day of my accident. i know that this sounds crazy, but my trumatic motorcycle accident was 24 years ago. i lost my leg and i was awake during the whole process. so seeing videos on whatsapp that showcase motorcycle accidents only kicks up my ptsd. so what i decided to do is simply delete whatsapp."
none,depression,351,"hey guys, so i had a little check up in class in which i got 7/10 points. i wanted to ask if the 3 points i wasn't given are justified. 1. we should translate the german equivalent for ""when someone is sick and he makes the transition from being into working life to being on sick leave"" into english. i wrote ""to go into sick leave"". hkes enough money to live, from doing something"" i wrote: ""make a living out of something"". when i asked my teacher about it she just gave me a weird look and told me that i had apparently used the wrong preposition, she said it's to be ""make a living from something"". i am convinced that both are possible. tell me reddit, what's right?"

ptsd,depression,353,"about a year ago, i started wondering if my ptsd symptoms would ever go away. the word *suffering* got stuck in my mind and wouldn't let go. what if i keep living, for years and years, betting that my suffering would get better someday and it never did? would i look back on the present and wish i had just known when to recognize that i've been dealt a bad hand, and fold? i couldn't decide. for months anher back... i carry that. but if i took my own life, i wouldn't just pass that pain on, but multiply it, by affecting so many lives. i waited to see if it was just a passing moment of positivity. but i think i did it. i finally decided to live! it seems like such a simple decision. simple, but not easy. this has been a big achievement for me. thank you for reading about it. i needed to say it to someone."

adhd,depression,355,"i failed a biochemistry test today. i knew i needed to study on time and i actually did start a few weeks ago. i had plenty of time to sit down and study for this very important test that would help me keep my grades up this semester. instead, i let my anxiety get the better of me - i stayed up all night, cycling between panic and apathy. i couldn't even sit through my therapy session today. this is on top of a bioethics paper that is now a day late. every year of college, i've started out strong only to crash and burn by the end of the semester. things have gotten better after my adhd diagnosis but this. keeps. happening. and after this morning's test, i **refuse** to let the anxiety and depression consume me. despite the fact i will most likely not get the high gpa i was hoping for this semester, i will not let that deter me from finishing at least in a decent spot, with my head held high. this is my plan: * after posting this, i will nap, shoto not only look for resources (suggestions welcome!) that can help me but to also start practicing using them and seeing what works (want to start studying for my classes next semester and work on my thesis). this set-back will most likely change my plans for med school. i also have to prepare myself for the interrogation/scrutiny/abuse hurled at me from my parents. i have to stay strong. my path may be different and longer than others but i will keep trying to pursue my dreams while also having back-up plans as well. thank you for reading. this is mostly to hold me accountable but i'll admit, i could use a bit of encouragement or friendly words. i can't turn to my parents for support, i have only one friend who i can confine in with these matters (but i don't want to burden her), and i'm... disappointed at myself right now. i need to hold it together but i am upset. if anyone else is also struggling with things right now, i'm also here for you."
anxiety,depression,356,"let me practice what i preach if i may... this morning, and most mornings, i fought off an incredibly severe bout of anxiety as soon as i opened my eyes. the rush of adrenaline and angst was nearly overwhelming. however, i took deep breaths,  let them pass and subtly replaced them with positive thoughts. i hope this can help at least one person to have a better day, or even a better moment to see that there's always a light. more positive posts would help all of us don't ya think?"
anxiety,depression,357,"i constantly feel like i’m being lied to. i overanalyze things, my brain always finds a way to twisted things people say so it seems like a lie. my head hurts and i often cry. things started to feel like this since i was being cheated on 6 years ago."

anxiety,depression,359,"it doesn't seem to matter how good of a day i had the day before or what happened it seems i always wake up with lots of depression and anxiety that doesn't fade away until two or 3pm. it seems as though my day is predetermined, some mornings for whatever reason i wake up with no anxiety or depression and its like i'm a completely different person. its almost guaranteed that that day will be a good day but the next day is usually back to the same old feeling in the morning that take all day to overcome. i feel like if i could replicate the few days i don't wake up with anxiety that my situation would improve."

bipolar,depression,368,"so last time i saw them they flat out said they don't trust me to take my meds and that even though i said i would, they don't believe me. then they told me i'm a liar because i've gone off meds before and told no one. first, yes i did go off my meds before for a lot of reasons but i always ended up getting back on them. this time i stopped for a stupid reason and i acknowledgeto take my meds without even asking why i stop them in the first place. they said they will cancel my prescription if the blood test results are low and they are not concerned that i'll be without meds. they were like, go to your gp if you like but i'll leave her a note. so i can't even go to my gp. tl;dr: i can't trust my own team anymore and i don't know where to go from here."

adhd,depression,375,"video games, weed, watching porn, eating fatty foods, drinking, etc. these are all things i find very hard to control. when i smoke a bit of weed i crave more instantly and i don't stop smoking until i'm baked out of my mind. whenever i'm feeling bad i start overeating, which leads to me feeling worse, which leads to more overeating. whenever i feel bored (which is quite often) i play video games. this leads to me using only video games for pleasure and to esccult emotions, and i dull myself with unhealthy behaviours, instead of just accepting the emotions and processing them in a healthy way. when i stop using these behaviours the negative thoughts and emotions start hitting me very hard. but probably that's just a phase you have to go through, to get out better on the otherside. are there others who struggle with balancing life like me? if you've found a solution, please elaborate. is this just a discipline thing?"
adhd,depression,376,told my parents and a few friends that i was diagnosed with adhd and after explaining what i face daily they just say that they did something similar a few times.

ptsd,depression,377,"anyone else experiencing this? i’ve finally gotten help for my ptsd and while i feel positive it will actually help me, i’m struggling to function. i work 8-5 and i’m exhausted from dealing with insomnia most nights. when i don’t have insomnia and actually sleep, i’m left with a loss of interest in all aspects of my job. i go to work, struggle to do any actual work, go home, eat, and lay on the couch or in bed  could try to survive on one salary but it may be hard. we just moved into a new apartment and the rent is a little high for one salary, so i feel obligated to work full time. does anyone else feel like this? are you able to work full time and deal with your ptsd? i get the feeling that i may be better off finding a part time job while i go to therapy for my trauma and give myself space to actually deal with it."

bipolar,depression,386,i love how easy it is to go from not giving one shit about what other people think to giving all the shits. the paranoia that people are talking about me. that the my friends suddenly don't like me. that my comments on reddit or facebook are unhelpful at best or outright stupid or offensive. at least it's not like the bad days before my diagnosis where i just thought i really was just a horrible person. at least now i know that i just have a broken brain and not just a completely broken/ defective as a person.

bipolar,depression,397,"tl;dr psychiatrist is rude and cold and blew me off. should i send a strongly worded email? i moved and got new insurance a year ago and so of course that meant new docs. i got a great therapist but strongly disliked my psychiatrist. she comes off as cold and without empathy. my first visit i was talking about binge eating and that i had eaten a whole pizza the day before and she laughed. not only did her cell phone ring in our appointment the other day, but she answered it! she takes terrible notes and doesn't bother to refresh herself on them before or even during the appointment. she asked me why she put me on a certain med and i had to explain her own reason back to her. she seems to have forgotten a few times that i'm bipolar (vs. being depressed). it's been a year, and while at first i really wanted to get a different doc this is an hmo and i couldn't unless she basically okayed it. i don't know, i didn't want a confrontation or to make her feel bad or something. with some time she proved herself to be really good dealing with medslly vulnerable state right now, which i told her, and refusing to squeeze a patient in after the appointment was cancelled on her end is ridiculous to me. that is common courtesy in my experience when you have a patient with time sensitive concerns. not to mention she had a number of on call slots (poor desk guy brought this up to her) and squeezing someone in to one of those in this type of situation is standard. he even seemed surprised she said no. after this i called and said i wanted to see someone else. she had to ok it and ""recommend"" someone but she did it by the end of the day. i can see then sooner than what my rescheduled appointment with her would have been. so i also have a desire to send her an email telling her that these types of things were inappropriate. i recognize that this would probably be more for my benefit than hers. the hmo also does encourage providing feedback, positive or negative, about their docs, so i could submit something that way. in sorry but i really feel like this woman is horrible in this profession."

adhd,depression,404,"**warning:** even i barely have the attention span to read this post, and i wrote it. i tried to break it up with ***~~excessive formatting.~~*** i don't think i succeeded. --- i've spent my whole life wondering why i procrastinate on things i enjoy doing. i think i've figured it out, and it's really fucking stupid. intellectually, i know that the future is a real thing. there is, in fact, a time other than now. i *know* that. but i don't *believe* it. my brain thinks time is a myth and there's no such thing as tomorrow. no matter how many times tomorrow comes, it refuses to believe that it will happen again. it's like i think the world is going to end in 15 minutes. and if the future doesn't exist, future happiness can't exist either. i should be writing right now. i enjoy writing. but i'm not currently writing, so the happiness i would derive from writing is obviously fake. ~*obviously*~. i do this shit with everything. writing, reading, talking to friends, going to the gym, throwing the ball for my dog, even playing a fucking video game. i like all those things, but at this precise moment i'm not experiencing pleasure derived from them, so it clearly can't be real. instant gratification is the only gratification i understand. if it doesn't make me happy in the next .04 seconds, it's never going to, right? that's why i spend hours dicking around on the internet. i'd enjoy going to the gym more tha the conscious person, and my brain, the subconscious asshole who's actually got the reins, can disagree on something. she doesn't get the difference between *knowing* and *believing*. and i don't get why she doesn't get it. hasn't she ever had to fight a part of herself? do normal people never feel like their brain is a separate entity that they have to fight for control? the constant struggle between your innate-but-baseless beliefs and your rationality seems like such a fundamental part of being a person. is it really not a thing for her, or am i just explaining it poorly? the part of me that tells me ""the future isn't real"" is the same part of me that screams ""you're gonna die"" every time i see a moth. both statements are wrong, and i know full well they're wrong, but that doesn't change anything. my heart rate still triples like the moth is an acid-spitting honey badger. i still fuck around like i'm frozen in time. i've been banging my head against this wall my entire goddamn life and made minimal progress. i don't think i'm making any progress now. i have no idea where to even start. i guess the moral of this rambling bitchfest is that adhd is really, really dumb. --- **tl;dr**: my adhd thinks the future is fake. i know the future is real, but i'm not in charge. i can't get started on things i enjoy because the enjoyment is in the future, which doesn't exist to me. the fuck am i supposed to do?"

adhd,depression,441,"hi, i'm going to tell you how meds have helped me. this is more of an encouragement post for those who are still questioning or don't regularly take meds, but it's also a success story in some regard. firstly, i had to struggle a lot through self-diagnosis then officially diagnosed as adhd-pi by a psych. i also have/had depression. it's difficult to fight these two if you don't understand exactly what you're dealing with. meds have helped me differentiate between the two. even if you don't have other accompanying mental baggage, they still allow you to function in a more concise manner. i did some research. they work because they give your brain some space to process from a different angle. for some, it is as a sudden breath of fresh air. for me, it was a room- meds don't necessarily change people. it may for some, but it doesn't have to. i was scared of using them. i'm a strict non-smoker (non anything harmful) and believe in good health. but these past 6-8 months, i've received the support i needed from my own self. now, i can see the need (and ways) to rely on others as well. it's truly amazing. tldr; meds can truly change your life if you are diagnosed, but it's not because of the meds. it's because of what they allow you to do. it's because for some like me, all that's happening is i'm living up more to my potential and that's still me. sorry if this reads depressing or doesn't flow logically. i used to be far worse - but now the new motto for me is ""what was difficult before shall be easy now"". make it happen."
bipolar,depression,442,"i was curious what people thought if it so far. the little activities have been interesting, but the questions they ask about if you did this or that on these medications has been somewhat useless to me. i've been on multiple medications for the majority of my adult life, so i don't always remember what caused what. i always assumed the brain fog was related to medication, and i was really kind of sad to find that the disorder causes it."

anxiety,depression,451,"my wife passed out from a panic attack yesterday in the theatre while we were watching *a quiet place*. i was so scared and didn't know what to do. about an hour into the movie, there's a scene where someone steps on a nail. it wasn't even very gory, but i guess it triggered some bad memories for her. a few seconds after that scene, my wife's arm started twitching kind of like a seizure. at the same time, she started making sounds like she was snoring or maybe choking. when i looked at her, her head was lolled to the side and her eyes were closed. not realizing what was happening, i nudged her a bit, thinking she had fallen asleep. when her head rolled to the other side and there wasn't any other response my concern sky-rocketed. i took her head in my hands and gently shook her a little bit trying to wake her up. her eyes partially opened, and i could see her pupils were looking up like when you roll your eyes. there was no other response. i tilted her head forward and the ""snoring"" sound stopped, but she was still unconscious. at this point, about half a minute or so had passeder feel safe. i tried to just hold her and comfort her. after about a half hour she was doing better. i felt so helpless when she was unconscious. it's very scary when you suddenly realize your loved one is having a medical emergency. later in the evening, she revealed to me that when she was a teenager, she had an abusive boyfriend that would rape her, cut her with a scalpel, and poke her with needles. sick stuff like that i guess. she wouldn't say much more about it than that. i am angry. not at her, but at the thought some sicko did this to her. and i hurt. i grieve that she has experienced something so traumatic it causes this type of thing. she agreed we will get her into some therapy. she needs healing that i never knew she needed. i also know this isn't about me, but i feel a bit hurt this is just now coming out. we've been married about 5 years, and i never knew this stuff. what else don't i know? i don't know what type of advice i'm looking for. how can i be there for her? how can i help? what do i do if this happens again? did i do the right thing both during and after?"

adhd,depression,453,"sometimes i feel like i'm thinking of nothing but i'm really thinking about what i'm thinking and that, of course, is distracting. it's almost like a ""meta-conversation"" about the conversation or whatever i'm doing. in it i analyze body language,add brain can explain how a non-add brain experiences conversation? (or life, lol) (this comes from a conversation a friend. i asked her if she ever ""thinks about her thoughts."" she looked at me strangely, couldn't really understand the concept.)"

ptsd,depression,455,"just, come on, universe! really? this therapist saved my life, i owe everything to her, but now i have to watch her go through chemo and radiation completely helpless to do anything. she assures me it's not severe, that they caught it early, that she expects to make a full recovery. it still sucks balls to walk into the office and see that she's bald and sometimes has a hard time finding words because the chemo fucks with her brain. i'm not looking for sympathy or advice, just a rant because it feels like the one thing in the whole world that i can't discuss with her."

adhd,depression,464,"there's a lot of stuff out there talking about the positive side of adhd and to be honest, it bugs me. i think i first experienced it after watching this [ted (""adhd sucks, but not really""). the idea seems to be that adhd isn't so bad, because it also makes us creative, or spontaneous, something like that. my reaction to that is always 'fuck that'. i just figured out why: it's stockholm syndrome. adhd has taken our lives hostage, made them markedly more difficu at x"" or ""if i didn't have adhd, i wouldn't be good at y"", instead try thinking ""i am awesome at this and i'm awesome at it *despite* having adhd "". ""i have adhd and yet here i am, kicking ass and it doesn't get to take credit for a single goddamned bit of it"". that way every positive thing you do is you breaking free of adhd, not being held hostage by it while it occasionally feeds you scraps. **tl;dr:** don't let adhd take credit for you overcoming your adhd."
adhd,depression,465,"the two are actually quite similar, so i would definitely take a look to make sure that you are going down the right path. it is also called ""emotional dysregulation disorder"" and it includes impulsivity, trouble concentrating, and zoning out. rejection sensitive dysphoria can very easily be confused with a borderline's fear of abandonment. you also lack identity, so you cling onto mental illnesses for your identity and tend to lack values, morals, or goals. it basically gives you the emotional intelligence of a 3-year-old, and you lack object constancy. so basically, you are constantly suspicious and worried about a close person's emotions changing when they aren't constantly talking to you or directly in your area."

bipolar,depression,467,"tl;dr; this year has been rough and i want to tell someone about it. bipolar, adventures, shitty relationships, growth. i need to tell someone about my year and i don't feel comfortable telling anyone i know the whole story. this is what happened in 2015. i went to cannes film festival where a film i worked on was showing. i drank wine on the roof tops of paris with one of my favorite friends and saw the louvre. i fell in love with my best friend at a music festival and literally had the best 10 days of my life, and some of the best sex too. i experience my worst bought of depression to date and contemplated suicide. this led me to seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist and getting diagnosed as bipolar. i'm on meds now and things have balanced out a little. i lost a lot of weight from being so down. i've made more art this year than ever before and i'm starting to sell it. i started renting a studio in an artist collective. i flew home to surprise my parents with a visit which meant a lot to them. i dated a lot of shitty guys. one hit me when he was drunk, one stuck his hand up me while i was sleeping and one was nuts. i found the guy i want to spend my life with and while he agrees that we'll end up togeecause there is finally a candidate i believe in. i donated to his campaign. i downloaded tinder. soon after that i deleted tinder. i gave up on dating. i recognized that i'm super emotionally distant and that's not fair to the nice dudes i date. i decided to move to a different city next year to freelance and make movies again. that really scares me but i'm doing it. i miss having a partner. i don't have anyone to rely on when i'm down. the dude i love needs space, the guys i've dated have made it super clear that i'm not their girlfriend and the close friends i do have are such a mess most of the time that i don't want to talk about my issues. i'm surrounded by lots of beautiful people, artists and musicians and students but my walls are built up so high that it's hard to relate to anyone. i bought a bike and i ride it a lot. my dog died. i got my first root canal. i walked around in the first snow and i liked it. this year has been the hardest year but i've also grown the most. i'm terrified next year will bring more of the same but i'm doing everything in my power to avoid that. i hope next year i can trust a little more, smile a little more, get back to being open. happy new year guys, and good luck."
anxiety,depression,468,"yesterday night i had bad mental distress. i couldn't sleep because of anxiety, felt like i was on edge. got only 5 hours of sleep, for my age (14) it's really exhausting. when i woke up my anxiety was flaming again. i am a starter lua scripter, i did some scripting for 30 minutes, and my anxiety disappeared. just amazing how doing something you're passionate about can help. i'm better now."

ptsd,depression,473,"hi everyone! just wanted to share this moment. i've been having hard time for quite a while, and today i woke up actually rested and refreshed! i know that everyone has problems sleeping or not getting enough, but i feel that people with ptsd can appreciate this especially well. i am on sleep meds, so i have been getting enough hours of sleep, but even so i haven't woken refreshed in a long time. i had practical issues, and big changes going on, and i was off my meds and then starting them again... adjusting to new doses and so on. there has been a lot going on, and so for months even after sleeping 8h i still wake up wanting to go to bed immediately. there have been a lot of unsettling dreams or just sleeping a lot and still being tired, dragging through my days, needing to write down all small tasks like do the disheng to feel all the resting and being in bed was a big my fault,being lazy or something- and now i am sharply reminded what normal energy feels like. now that i have some, i don't feel like being in bed. i can actually think more clearly, i have enough energy to want to do things. it's amazing feeling. i just wanted to share to everyone struggling with sleep on here. it can get better:). (and i know- i'm taking sleep meds. it's less because i wouldn't sleep otherwise, and more because i have trouble falling asleep. but maybe in the future i'll be able to get off them. but for now being able to fall asleep around the same time feels important for getting healthier. anyway, wanted to share this feeling with all of you who know what it's like waking every night from nightmares and feeling sick and exhausted. it gets better."

bipolar,depression,477,"monthly appointment with my doctor again. so i was a little worried about feeling this weird ""not caring"" on some things that i usually do. so i brought it up when he asked, is there anything you want to bring out? i told him that i find it strange when i'm supposed to be angered in a situation and i feel like i don't care anymore. i can't figure out the reason why but i just choose automatically to not care. there are also other aspects but it's more difficult to illustrate. so he asked me, is that good or bad? i replied, that's the issue, i don't know. i'm not sure if it is good or bad. i said maybe imm just tired of being stressed. he smiled and i was surprised when he said, then it's good that you are becoming resilient to daily stress."

bipolar,depression,481,"facebook seriously stresses me out. does anyone else struggle with social media? i have a hard time staying connected to friends and family because the things people post can be serious triggers for me. it doesn't matter if i'm upcycling or downcycling, something is bound to either agitate or depress me. sometimes i go on binges of unfollowing people. that doesn't help because then i don't have those connections and my feed fills up with promoted crap thaationships. i have my immediate family, and a couple of close friends (that's funny. i haven't seen them in literally a year and a half) but everyone else is an acquaintance at best. i don't even talk to my mother unless i have to, and that's after we've mended our relationship (as much as possible at this point). i'm not asking for advice, i just want to know that i'm not alone in feeling like this. do others have the same experiences? can you share some?"

bipolar,depression,499,"i've been having a weird feeling lately, a lot like what i experienced two years ago when i first went off all psych meds. i'd been on medication since i was 11, for more than half my life (most of which only made things worse) and it felt like i was seeing the world for the first time. i had missed out on so many normal teenage/early 20s experiences and there was just so much i hadn't figured out. but while i'm still not sure my medication is even helping me, the one thing i do know is that quitting drinking has given me a similar sense of clarity. not that i was drung your medication as prescribed but still abusing substances, i'll be honest and say... you're probably going to have a rough time. while i don't think complete abstinence is necessary for everyone, i feel like just not drinking at all makes things a whole lot easier for me. of course alcohol is pretty much unavoidable in our culture... and yeah, it does get lonely at times. but i don't have to stress my brain thinking about when i'm crossing the line. and that just makes everything so much easier. believe me, it's better on the other side. i'm doing good. you will too."

adhd,depression,562,"this cycle repeats itself until we/i get depressed--a low level but long lasting state of depression without swings, without strong emotions, a sort of vacant apathy. this isn't at all to say that its perpetual or hopeless, i'm just looking to open discussion about how to break this (without medication). for too many of us this pattern is sustainable. it leaves us drained and ashamed, but because of circumstance theres nothing that kicks us into gear. feel free to vent and support others, different perspective is good perspective!"
adhd,depression,563,"i've been keeping a log for the last week. every 15 minutes from 6am to 9:45pm has a little box where i write what i do. i'm doing this to help see where my time is going. i use a highlighter to mark out where what i'm doing actually contributes to my goals. if you were at a 9-5 job, it would be things that actually involve your job. so far my days are roughly 2 hours of work per day. on friday i did 15 minutes of work in the entire day. the rest is researching random things on the internet, lunch, reddit, flipping through books, exercising, shower. some of these things are useful of course, but the actual focused work time is far less than i thought. if you've not done this, it's worth trying."
ptsd,depression,565,"trigger warning: sexual assault, rape, physical abuse, mental abuse, mother mention. growing up my mother was raped in the same room as me multiple times by her boyfriend. she was beaten mercilessly, and we were abused physically, mentally and verbally by him. when i was young, we moved 500 miles away from our home when he went to prison. my mom continued to be in contact with him, sending him money, being his victim. we had an agreement. he would never know where we lived or visit us. ever. ... i woke up at 9 am to him outside of my home. when i asked questions and made a fuss becaus my mom, i love my mom, i want to see my mom and hug her and tell her i love her but she really chose this man over me. oh and at the end? she did admit he was there and that she gaslighted me apparently. but i barely remember that part. she always says 'it was me who got raped and got my head bashed in why are you messed up from it?!' and invalidates my diagnosed ptsd and i just... guess me getting away from her is for the best? she can't make her rent without me. so i'm worried. i also left my medications there and idk how i'm gonna be without them. but... guess i'm a victim no more?"

bipolar,depression,568,"i was diagnosed with bipolar 1 &amp; c-ptsd (repetitive childhood trauma and abuse) , 4 years ago. mainly after a severe 6mo. long manic episode in which i was convinced i was indestructible and a direct channel of god, resulting in multiple unintended near death experiences related to drugs, alcohol and physical safety. long story short, “bipolar” in itself has been one hell of a show. since my first severe episode i have experienced a multitude of smaller shorter lived episodes 2 out of 4 which would probably even fall in the hypomanic category. the depression always lasts much longer (usualat i seem to exhibit all symptoms of bipolar each day, simultaneously and more consistently. redditors, i’m usually better spoken but my brains in shambles and i’m eager for you to make me think deeper on this and reflect before i word barf it to my psych. anyway. i’m not to familiar with schizo effective but am starting to feel that could possibly be more fitting. i don’t want more meds in my life. i’m also an avid micro dosed, lsd, dmt &amp; earth medicine user for some background and am very on board with alternative medicine to get me back to “reality”. at least one i can be comfortable in."

none,depression,574,"i've decided to write this short guide to help exchanges as people keep contacting me for advice. if anybody has a question or concern that hasn't been answered, then feel free to message me or post it in the comments. if anybody wants more info about my travels see my previously submitted posts / *1. what is a help exchange?* in basic terms a help exchange is where you work for somebody and instead of being paid in currency, you're paid in accommodation, meals or both. *2. why do a help exchange?* the most immediate answer is because it can keep your travel budget down. accommodation and food are two things that are often pretty high when travelling. by working for both, you don't need to spend as much money on your travels. this is especially useful in more expensive countries. the downside is that you need to work. the average amount is 4-5 hours per day, but many hosts are more liberal or conservative with work hours. i've done help exchanges where i've barely done anything and been treated like a king. i've also done some where i've worked my arse off for very little in return. aside from budget, a help exchange can be a great way to see a country. it allows you to interact with locals and see the reality of a place. you'll experience life as a part of the population, more or less. rather than being stuck on a beaten tourist path. this can open doorways into experiences and places you'd never usually see or even know about. the work can also be enriching and interesting. if you're travelling long term, it can really be quite boring and draining to move from place to place sightseeing all the time. it's nice to stay in the same place and do something other than look at things for a bit! *3a. what type of work do you do?* the number and variety of help exchanges available are almost limitless. i'm not sure which help exchange website started first, but i think it was wwoofing. wwoofing started as a help exchange for organic farms. so the types of tasks were pretty much limited to farming. that is to say, weeding (lots of weeding), planting, digging, making fences, milking cows, feeding chickens etc. general farm labour. because organic farming is pretty much synonymous with alternative lifestyles, a lot of help exchanges have popped up connected to this. so now there's more than just farms, there are communes, hotels, hostels, campgrounds, and any number of other places. each place would have the tasks associated with that place, i wont bother writing them as they're numerous. basically though, due to the non use of chemicals in organic farming you can expect that a lot of wwoofing will entail you do some weeding at some point! (weeding = pulling bad plants from the soil.) helpx and workaway came later. these offer help exchanges at places that aren't necessarily connected to organic farming. many of the places are still farms though, just not specifically organic. but there are also things like families looking for childcare, retirees looking for somebody to do their gardening, motels or backpackers wanting people to clean rooms. (brief aside - i've noticed that backpackers / motels often only exchange accommodation for work. no food.) both websites seem to have a good degree of every day people that just want something done or want to meet travellers. in terms of hours worked, this also usually differs although 4-5 hours is usually average. (work in the morning and chill out in the afternoon / evening.) *3b how long do you stay with a host?* there is no minimum or maximum limit for how long you stay with a host, this is upto you and the host to agree. in the past i've generally just stuck to 1-2 weeks as i find this is a good enough amount of time to get to know the host but also long enough that i don't get bored. it's also a bearable amount of time, so if you hate the project you know it will end soon. many hosts will mention that they prefer workers to stay for at least a week if they're in rural areas, usually because it's a lot of work for them to pick you up from town and it's useless to do all that for just 2 days. if you do plan to stay at a place for a few months, it's worth talking to the host about a trial period for the first week. that way if you hate it after a week you can leave without any hurt feelings. likewise if they hate you, they can ask you to go. *4a. which website is best to ming or they don't need help at the time you're arriving. that or like most of us, they read your email and said they'll reply later but never got around to it. if you don't get a reply it doesn't hurt to send another email again after a short time. *9. how much will i spend?* as mentioned in the 2nd question, help exchanges are a great way to cut down on expenses. the question is an impossible one to answer though as we're all different. if you spend all your time at your help exchange, eating nothing but the free food given to you, you're basically going to spend nothing. if you go into town after work every day and buy lots of luxuries then you'll spend more money (duh!). it all depends on your self-control and the lifestyle you like. town is the devil when it comes to money. if you're looking to save money, avoid it at all costs as it's really hard to avoid spending! (who can resist luxury ice cream and candy? not i!) *10. how do i get to my help exchange?* many hosts will pick you up from the nearest town or bus stop. you should arrange this with them beforehand to ensure that it's ok for them to do so. from there it's up to you how to get to that town, but usually bus is the cheapest way, no matter where you are in the world. trains are great too in certain areas, or even hitchhiking! *11. can you do a help exchange as a couple?* if you have a partner (or friend) and you want to travel with them, it's just as easy to do a help exchange as a couple. actually helpx and workaway have couples memberships so that hosts can see you're a couple. i've travelled with my girlfriend and done a bunch of help exchanges with her and we've often had hosts looking us up on the site and inviting us to stay with them. a lot of hosts seem to prefer couples because it is more convenient for them. they get double the labour but only have to put in the same amount of effort as they would for one person. (eg. if they took on two separate people, this would mean sending two lots of emails, going to the bus station twice, setting up two different beds in their house etc. where as for a couple they only need to do all of this once.) *12. do i need a work visa to do a work exchange?* since you aren't getting paid for your work exchange, a work visa is unnecessary. however, in some countries a work exchange is a grey area. i've read stories of people being denied entry to countries when they reveal they're coming to do a work exchange. probably because customs just hear the word ""work"". the best thing to do in this situation is to say you're entering a country to travel around or to go sightseeing. don't give customs an excuse! if you don't want to lie, just say you're volunteering which doesn't have the same connotations. for more info check out [this ) *13. i've never done anything like this before. i'm a useless shlub, why would anybody want to host me etc?* most hosts are patient enough to show you what to do, so no matter how useless you think you are it doesn't really matter. the most important thing is to go with the flow and not be against the idea of learning something new. as long as you are willing to work hard you'll do fine at most help exchanges. a lot of help exchange tasks are easy to learn and quite menial. i've never mowed a lawn before and at my last help exchange i had to do it. my host showed me how to turn on the lawnmower and use it, then set me to work on his lawn. (ok, his lawn looked like shit afterwards, but i tried my best!) anyway, one thing i always keep in mind on my help exchanges is that in terms of labour it is incredibly cheap for the host. sometimes when i'm eating amazing meals the hosts have cooked, i think to myself “shit, i just did 4 hours of gardening and i'm having this tasty meal. i should have worked for 8 hours.” but it's always good to remember that if the host had paid a professional gardener for 4 hours of work it'd cost a hell of a lot more than one meal would. just by providing yourself as labour you're saving your host a ton of money so they're eager to have you. although most work can be manual, it is not tough. i am a complete weakling and i have managed pretty much every task i've been given, including sawing down trees with a handsaw. help exchanges are a great way to challenge yourself and prove you can do these things, which is one of the many reasons i enjoy doing them."

adhd,depression,599,"i'm over the moon excited right now. crying. i took a practice lsat this morning after starting ritalin on saturday. i went from a score of 157 (~70th percentile) to 172 (~99th percentile) because i took a pill. that puts me squarely within striking distance of harvard, yale, stanford and columbia. i think with a few weeks practice, i could be testing at 175+, putting me above the median scores for all of those schools. getting this diagnosis is like waking up from a miserable dream. i've known so long i was very capable, but i just didn't seem to be able to get the power to the road. i started to think i was just delusional, and that this feeling that i could be doing so much more was just a sign of entitlement and arrogance. i've quit and been fired from 15 jobs over the last decade, most of them minimum wage. i got fired from a ntial, and it's unraveled this insipid american myth that i had grown up believing that people get what they deserve, that hard work conquers all. if had been born 50 years ago, i'd probably be on track to drug abuse and an early death. i've become much more sympathetic to systemic injustice and inequality and more forgiving of everyone around me. my heart has grown exponentially through all of this. maybe now i'll be able to put that goodness to good use. adhd doesn't mean you're stupid. and it's so fucking real. anyone who tells you otherwise is ignorant or a moron or both. fuck 'em. you're all amazing here. the fact that any of you are alive and haven't given up makes you heroes in my book. and let this be a reminder to get more help if you're feeling like you can't manage. it's not your fault. there is help out there. god bless."

adhd,depression,603,"does anybody have a problem with their day-dreaming quickly and aggressively turning into wish fulfillment? for example, even minor success at anything (writing or a little bit of coding) quickly sends me careening into another 30 minutes of 'what i'll say at the podium when i'm reading my acceptance speech for the nobel/booker/etc replete with imaginary people who i can tell to suck it plus even more imaginary people who i'll thank/call out for their continued help/support'. a whole scenario basically. i know how absurd/childlike this is but at the same time have been unable to do much to stop it."
adhd,depression,604,"so... you know the thing where you get way over invested for about a month and then completely forget about them? i do that, a lot. so i came up with this plan. in hindsight i’m not sure why i ever thought it would work. it seemed like a good idea at the time. it goes like this: if i date someone i’m not interested in, i won’t obsess. if i don’t obsess i won’t get bored, iin mouth filter. if he asks why i don’t think it’ll work, currently all i’ve got is ‘i just find you boring’. i can’t say that to him. i just can’t. i might have to date him for eternity just to avoid it. so, yeah. psa: finding them boring from the start doesn’t stop you finding them boring later. also: how do i ditch him without hurting him?? tl;dr: bored of a guy, again."
anxiety,depression,605,"for example, my parents are going away for a week later this year. i don't want to be at home alone, but i can't sleep out of my house, i haven't slept out in at least 10 years. i asked a friend if they would mind sleeping over and they were like ""sure! i'd be glad to"". i was like, what, they just agreed like that??? they're so cool with sleeping out???? what???? aren't they going to miss their bed? and pets? and family? so weird to me."

bipolar,depression,607,"i'm 24f and have no intention of having kids until i'm 30 at the earliest. still, i get anxious whenever i think of having kids and the possibility of genetically passing down my mental illness. i know having kids is something that everyone should think hard about, but i feel extra torn and weighed down by this big but not imminent decision. does anyone else share this fear or have any sage advice? are their any bipolar parents out their that can speak to this? i don't want to bring someone into the world just so they can suffer, but i know that i myself am thankful for being alive and experiencing the world, even with my diagnosis."
adhd,depression,608,"i know medication isn’t for everyone but concerta has really done wonders for me. i feel like adhd, for me, is like a box of electric cables. you get four or five in the box and it’s a bit painful to get the one you want out but it’s doable. get 20+ cables in the box and it’s a nightmare. so, lately i feel like i’ve got a box full of tangled cords in my brain and yesterday that culminated in really bad anxiety. i felt like i was getting really over sensitive at work, i didn’t get my gym program done for the week because i ended up trying to drinill get anxiety and i still struggle wit life a decent amount but knowing that a few bad weeks doesn’t end in a depressive episode where i basically turn off life as much as possible for weeks if not months is a huge improvement. and not just for myself but for my husband as well. anyway, don’t really know what the point of this post was ha i guess i just feel like i needed to share with people that understand seeing as i’m too broke for a psychologist appointment right now haha hope all you fine people are out there being your best selves today!"
ptsd,depression,609,"anyone else wish this was real? seriously. if a technology was ever invented that could erase trauma memories, that would be the best thing ever. i mean... does anyone think trauma memories have a purpose? does anyone think it'd be better to keep those memories, if a cure could erase them?"
adhd,depression,610,"i was lucky enough to be able to give it a shot because i moved into my dorm today. i packed 3 boxes and 2 were under-packed. i basically asked myself what the bare essentials were. things that i had duplicates of. things i could do without. for example, i decided not to bring my christmas lights because, although i like dim lights, my desk lamp pointed at the wall gives an identical ambient *stuff* but now i know where everything is. i can drop my keys on the counter and find them easily and not worry about knocking other things off. it's great.i want my keys, i glance at the counter and they're *right there* no other distracting stimuli, just keys. i feel so calm and in control. i can focus on other things besides wasting mental energy filtering out all that unnecessary stimuli."

anxiety,depression,614,"one of the biggest fears of my life is getting scolded. i fear getting scolded more than i fear my future career. even if i know, deep down, that the other person is nice and probably understanding, i get so nervous about it that it affects my ability to do work. i submitted something in late and i was so sure my boss was going to blow up on me that i paced around for hours at home, but he called and was very understanding. it's exhausting having to live life as a panicky mess. i was scolded once by a strict coach when i was 15 and it took me actual years to get over it. after that one encounter, i was so scared that i would get heart palpitations and have to be physically forced to go to practice."
ptsd,depression,615,"i keep purposely triggering myself and i dont know why. it feels like the only way i can validate my stupid trauma to myself. i feel like im over exaggerating but as soon as i badly trigger myself im like ""oh okay my ptsd is real.."" not sure if i make any sense, im very dissociated at the moment. but i was just wondering, does anyone else purposely trigger themselves? :/"

ptsd,depression,618,"i've been like this for 8 or 9 years now, life is just sort of grey, no joy or anything (except negative emotions like anger and depression, but never positive ones). i never had much of a social life, let alone a romantic one, and it doesn't even bother me, but that's the problematic part, before the traumatic events i was outgoing and always craved a connection with others, but now i don't feel the need for any of it. is there a way out?"
none,depression,619,"a couple of days ago, sri lankan fielders complained about the pollution in delhi and everyone here and elsewhere mocked them for being ""pussies"" (as if being able to withstand pollution is a matter of pride) today, lakmal literally vomited on the field. then our very own shami followed that up by almost throwing up as well. clearly, there are ""pussies"" in our rank as well. this craphole that we call our capital needs to be banned from hosting any international events. the crop burning has stopped for quite a while. yet the pollution chart for rk puram still reads &gt;400 delhi needs to get its act together"

adhd,depression,623,"and i like it. after reading another redditor's comment about stress and dopamine for adhders, i finally understand why i married my wife. i won't go into any examples, but let's just say i have to be involved in anything that she does. i also have to earn for bot(wife does not like to live in an apartment). travel all around the world with my wife at my company's expense (wife does not want to be alone). i posting this so for all the single and depressed out there. there is hope for you. you just need the right motivator."

anxiety,depression,625,"hey everyone, since quitting weed 1.5 years ago due to the worst (and first) panic attack of my life, i have been experiencing extreme anxiety and panic attacks. i experienced the weirdest and most horrible symptoms including convulsions, nausea, butterflies in stomach, thoughts of death, ectopic heart beats, rolling panic attacks lasting hours/days, itchy skin, pain during urination, sever depression, feeling like i can’t breathe, feeling like i am going to die, insomnia, depersonalisation, derealisation, pains in c free for the last 6 weeks. i also read this book which helped a lot, it’s called rewiring your anxious brain. these two things along with changing jobs from one i hated to one i love has in my opinion cured my anxiety. i am turning 27 this year and the last 1.5 years of my life were the absolute worst years of my life. i am finally loving life again and am so happy that the panic attacks have disappeared and that i am not constantly thinking i am dying. hope this helps anyone who is in a similar situation that i was."
none,depression,627,"throwaway frankly, i don't believe people are calling. i work in a senator's office (i won't name which) and i only got a handful of calls about sopa/pipa. and that's after we had about 2-3 front page posts on reddit about them. we talk a big game, flaunt our shit, but in reality, are we doing anything? **call your senator or representative.** i know some of you have sent letters and emails, and i am thankful for those. but the reality is that letters and emails take a ton of time to process, sometimes even months (depending on the office). it's even worse if a senator is well known and gets a ton of letters already (mccain, kerry, reid, franken, sanders etc...). phone calls aady more than nothing. trust me. normally, interns are on the other end of the line and they are just as terrified as you are :). some extra talking points: * instead of blocking websites that promote piracy, why not promote incentives that reduce piracy? spotify, netflix, steam, hulu... we are in a digital age, and holding onto physical media is becoming more and more obsolete * explain how rep. lamar smith's website would've been taken down with sopa/pipa * explain how modern stars like justin bieber (bad example) would've never gained recognition if sopa blocked their content *also, phones have voicemail. so if you don't want to talk to someone, call after business hours ;)*"

ptsd,depression,634,"i was 21 at the time, now i'm 22. in may of 2017, i got really sick out of no where. in a matter of 3 days, i went from feeling slightly out of it, to intense thunderclap headaches, pale, body aches, delirium, and ultimately passing out. i didn't want to make a scene or go to the hospital because i was just starting a new full time job, but i had a feeling that i was going to die. i can't really explain that very well, but i just knew deep down that someone was very wrong. at 4am i took an uber to the hospital and when i got there, upon checking my vitals (very low blood pressure and 160 resting heart rate) the nurses helped me onto a wheelchair and wheeled me into a bed in the intensive care unit. at this point, my memory is very groggy but i remember multiple people helping me take my clothes off to change me into a gown, and then doing an ecg on me. they got an iv into me and gave me a valium injection, as well as nausea medicine. i thought that was odd because i didn't feel nauseous at the time. the doctor came in and asked me what was wrong. i just cried and said my head hurt so bad, adn't push me too hard my fist few weeks back (i have a very physical job). now i'm healthier, but i still have a constant fear of getting sick again. i try to explain this to my mom and friends, but they think i'm just being dramatic and a hypochondriac. i don't feel safe anywhere but the hospital. i'm constantly scared. i don't have a fear of death, but knowing that i could easily become diseased and suffer, and leave all that i love behind makes me sad. it makes me sad that people don't understand what i went through. they are not educated on sepsis and think well ""hey, she didn't have cancer"" (my coworker actually said that, and later attributed my sepsis to being a vegetarian). i really don't talk about it a lot, but when i do, i get eye rolls. it's like people think i enjoyed taking a month off work. i constantly suffer from panic attacks now, where i feel dizzy and can't breathe well, but there's not much i can do about that. ativan doesn't help. my body and mind have been through hell and no one understands, or gives a shit. thank you for reading, i just had to get this off my chest."

none,depression,648,"it's not that we lose power all the time, internet is slow, poverty, hassling, haggling, scams, the things that most people hate... it's that it has made me so goddamn cynical. i have to assume that anyone who's indian that approaches us, wants to take something from us. i talk to a man for 5 minutes and he invites us to dinner. he probably wantsy speak a word. i'm to the point where i'm about to just completely ignore any passerby who attempts to speak with us. is that too much? any advice on coping with this kind of cynicism? i can't afford not to be vigilant like this, because i feel like i'd be sacrificing safety. but i also hate not being able to give people the benefit of the doubt."

ptsd,depression,653,"lately i have been having lots of flashbacks to the sexual molestation and sexual assault that happened in my past. i had multiple family members sexually abuse me as a child and was raped as an adult. the shame and guilt i live with has really damaged my self worth and image. i was used from a young age to pleasure others. i was a pleaser and wanted love so i let things happen to my body and kept them secrets so i would have that love and attention they gave me. people that were supposed to protect me hurt me and it became a common thing in my life. i only knew that giving my body to others was the way to be ""loved and wanted"". anyways, all my self loathing and flashbacks have left me wanting to hurt myself and suicide seems like the easiest way to end all the pain. i dont want to die but the suffering is to much ae touched by someone or that people are thinking sexual thoughts about me. when i'm in public alone i am in a constant state of panic that at any moment someone will try to sexually take advantage of me. just today i was at a craft store with my brother and i thought a man was following me so that he could look at my body or try to sexually assault me. i know logically that he's probably just walking around looking for what he needs but my flight or fight gets activated and i'm ready to run. all i want is to be able to get through a day without wanted to hurt myself. my therapists have given me lots of techniques to use but i feel like i'm not able to put them into practice on my own. i feel lost, and hopeless. how do i stop relying on my horrible coping mechanisms and use the mindfulness techniques they've given me?"

adhd,depression,659,"for anyone suffering and on the fence about it, give it even more serious thought. also this might be a bit of an overreaction seeing as its just the first fucking day but if this is how things are normally going to be then yeah; i should have done this ages ago. when i went on academic probation after my first year of college my mother told me that i should consider going back on it and would pay for it. i declined; citing that i did not want to be on the medication for my whole life and that i didn't want my success to be thanks to a pill. prideful. i did not want to be seen as ""weak"" needing medication just to focus on things that people did so easily. fast forward almost two years. i got my associates at a community college, but barely. my gpa was just a hair below 2.5, preventing me from transferring. i did land a job that paid well and i enjoyed. i had it for a year before hitting 3 strikes and being let go. 1st strike was because i went to fast and didn't double check something. 2nd strike was honestly just me not clocking in during the window before shift started. several of these tardies were over because i would get carried away talking to my co-workers about what needed to be done before shift (i had an odd job and this was required. i showed up 10-15 minutes early each shift). i would clock in after the buzzer rang, reminding me. 3rd strike was because of repeated problems in just failing to do certain things after being told to so. if i didn't writeted*. like the world is open to me now. literally every teacher i've had has mentioned that i should be doing a lot better than i am right now. every employer has praised my skills and work ethic but bemoaned on how i might solve problems other can't, but stumble on the simple things we do every day. today is a turning point. things will not be the same. the world had better watch out, because i don't think its prepared for /u/replieswithanimegif on medication. thank you to /r/adhd, and your wiki in particular. reading through the wiki was an eye opening experience that convinced me that i wasn't weak/broken/whatever. i had an issue. there was a solution. i realized that i was what i criticized often; someone refusing to acknowledge the answer when its staring right in front of them. thank you for helping me confront my pride and shove the answer in their face. tl;dr /r/adhd wiki is amazing. after two years of getting very little done academically and losing my job over add issues i've finally swallowed what to me was a bitter pill. if today is any indication, this is the beginning of major beneficial change. for the first time in a long time, i'm going to go to sleep without the thought of all the things i didn't get done tormenting me and making me feel inadequate. at least if adderall doesn't fuck up my sleep too much since i took it at like 1pm. thankfully my old job had me up till 12am anyways and i often don't get to sleep until 2 or 3am. here goes nothing."

bipolar,depression,670,"i've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, nos, since november 15 2017. my world was turned upside down that day. it's been seven months since, and i've done an incredible amount of reflection and research. how this affected my life up to this point, what i need to do moving forward, and how i need to approach things anew. the most fraught is the topic of bdsm. i have been involved in my local bdsm community for a few years, and i've learned much about safe, sane and consensual, as well as risk aware consensual kink. impact play, rope, sensory deprivation, wax, electric play, fire play... i've had experiences as a dominant and as a submissive, i've fucked up more than once, and i've learned from all of these experiences. but i've also placed myself in harms way. more times, i think, than even i realize. two instances that come to mind are when i impulsively jumped in a cast iron cage and asked to be locked in without designating a dominant, limits, what i wanted to happen, anything like that. i just wanted to fuck around. i scooted myself around the floor \(the cage was on wheels\), undid locks, twiddled with the wheel brakes, did everything i could to just be a nuisance and try to get away. when someone took a cane and started rattling the bars, literally, i tried grabbing at it and was struck on my big toe. reflexively i called ""red"", the 'scene' ended, and i was left with the sordid task of sorting out exactly where i went wrong: i should not have gotten into that cage in the first place. i didn't set up any of the usual safety guards, and i fell into a significant depression after that. it was awful. before that even, i negotiated a scene with a trusted dominant friend of mine. i told him ""i want to go hard, i want to push past my limits."" he started flogging me, i took it, but then i felt an incredible **rage** pushing itself outside of me. i bellowed like a lion, attacked the concrete wall in front of me, tears streaming down my face, so angry so sad so fucking furious so much self hatred. i asked him to hit me as hard as he could with his fists, and...he said no. he hit me, he placed his strikes well, but he immediately started winding down the scene and did not hit me as hard as he could. we've talked about that night many times since, and last night we discussed it again. in short, he suspected that i was bipolar for a while, because of that  but when he suggested knife play, a kink i brought up very early with him, i knew that he felt confidence enough in me to judge me fit to explore this particular kink. and that means a lot to me. i'm safer now. i am seeking and getting the help i need. i'm more readily able to consent now, being of sound\(er\) mind and able to fully, presently grasp everything that is happening and that i am agreeing to, without losing myself to my mind's maelstrom. and i am saner. but i think that goes without saying. the bedrock of what i have always believed in, the foundation of how i try to practice my kink \-\- safe, sane, consensual \-\- is strengthened, and i really feel indebted to my dominant friend, as well as all the others who have taught and coached and reprimanded me in my journey, for keeping me safe while i had less insight than i ever knew into what i was trying to do. i feel a lot of shame and remorse and...anger at myself. for how i may have acted in scenes past, if they didn't go as planned, or if i've acted unpredictably when my senses were notched up to an 11 when submitting. all i can do at this point is express my remorse, hope that the right ears will hear it, try to forgive myself and move forward with the treatment that i so sorely need under my belt. mental health and bdsm are inextricably linked, and though this may be obvious to any serious practicioner, what was not obvious to me was my own complete anosognosia: my lack of insight into my own behavior, feelings, my condition, how it impacted my ability to consent, to reasonably and safely dominate, to give consent as a submissive,... i could have been seriously hurt in my journey, and it's only by the hands, eyes and actions of those who knew better that i have been kept safe when playing with them. and i am really indebted to them for that. this is really an...entire expose of my emotions and my thoughts over the past 24 hours, as so much has poured through my mind since last night, so many reflections and thoughts and observations and self\-judgments... by writing this, i want to let you understand where i'm at and where i hope to go...because despite the rocky road, i've found intimacy and friendship and fun and mastery in my communities, and that's something i will fight to improve myself for. because self care is sexy, but also because it's essential to safe, sane, consensual kink."

ptsd,depression,696,"hi. i’ve wanted to tell my story on here for quite a while. i hope it’s not too lame of a reason to suffer from ptsd, but with the one-year anniversary coming up soon, i think it’s time. on october 4, 2017, i got off work around 7am, and i stopped in lake stevens, washington to find a quick geocache on the way home. this was something i did pretty often, and i had never had any negative consequences before. it’s a fun hobby, and i still really enjoy it as much as i can. it was about 42 degrees fahrenheit outside, and we had already had some cold days, so i never expected what was about to happen. i was looking for the cache in the woods between two residential streets. there was somewhat of a trail, but it faded out because the forest wasn’t very dense. the leaves were already well into the process of falling from the trees for the winter, so there was very little bushwhacking that needed to be done. my gps led me to an old rotting stump, a common place for a geocache to be hidden in the pacific northwest, so i searched in that area. suddenly, i felt my foot give a little, and then there was a stabbing pain on the outside of my right leg. at first, i couldn’t figure out what was happening, and then i felt the stabbing pain again, this time on my left leg. i figured that i had stepped into a thorn bush or an ant hill at first, and i moved away from the spot where i’d been standing. that was when i saw them. there were hundreds of yellow jackets coming at me, flying at my face and crawling into my hair. i started running toward some houses in the distance with my eyes closed and trying to shield my face. i could hear this loud, nonstop buzzing, and i could feel them stinging my ears. when i opened my eyes briefly, i saw that my left arm was covered in wasps. i screamed, hoping someone would hear me, and i kept running toward the houses. they kept following me and kept stinging relentlessly. i felt one go into my mouth while yelling for help, and i think i swallowed it. i felt a couple of them try to crawl into my nose, and i pulled them out. then, the burning began. there was this intense, systemic, hellish feeling of being set on fire, burning alive from the inside out. my legs gave out from under me, and i figured that i would die soon. i heard a lady from one of the houses yell to me that she’d called 911, and that they were on the way. i thought that maybe i should just wait for them. it wouldn’t be too long, and i wasn’t sure if i could walk. i still had a good tenth of a mile to the nearest house, but i was in so much fucking pain. i decided to keep going because something was telling me to. something gave me the feeling that if i stopped and waited, i’d be dead before anyone found me. it was a struggle to get my legs under me, so much so that i had to grab onto a tree to pull myself up. everything was feeling weak. i kept running, hoping that my legs would continue to support my weight. i was starting to feehile i was in the hospital, and i found out later that it had taken ativan, toradol, and dilauded to sedate me. my normally low blood pressure was around 180/100 at first but stayed around 140/90 even while i was sedated. during my time in washington, i didn’t have any family living near me, so i called my coworker to come pick me up from the hospital when i woke up. i asked if they could just send me home in a cab, but they refused, saying that someone needed to watch me for the next few hours. when my coworker got there, i started to get dressed, and then i remembered that there might still be wasps in my clothes. my colleague took everything outside the room to shake it out, and sure enough, half a dozen dead yellow jackets fell out of my clothes. i didn’t want to put them back on after that, but i didn’t have any other clothes to wear. the hospital discharged me eventually with an epi-pen and some prescriptions for pain medicine and steroids. i didn’t have an allergic reaction, and there was minimal swelling, but the doctor said she wasn’t sure what would happen if i ever got stung again. there is a distinct possibility that the large amount of toxin will trigger a severe allergic reaction next time. comforting, right? when i got home, i slept almost nonstop for the next few days. the pain eventually wore off, but my body was extremely weak for quite a while after. when i was awake enough, i counted my stings. on the part of my body that was visible, i counted just over 150 stings. this did not include the ones beneath my hair or any that were on the back of my neck. my arms and hands got the worst of it, but there were quite a few on my legs, face, feet, and torso. even now, a bunch of the stings have scarred over and left me with a bunch of ugly splotches on my arms. within a few weeks, i made an almost complete recovery physically. today, the only lasting effects of the ordeal are a decreased sense of smell and some floaters in my eyes. mentally, however, my recovery has been agonizingly slow. i have always been afraid of wasps/bees/hornets, but it has now become a full blown phobia. the nightmares suck, but i’m dealing with them. the worst thing is the flashbacks which happen multiple times a day completely at random. i can’t go outside anymore without watching my every move. i can’t relax. i have to be aware of everything around me. it kills me inside because i loved being outside hiking, swimming, kayaking, etc. i very rarely get to do any of those things anymore because of ptsd. every time i walk outside, i half expect to feel that stabbing pain coming at me out of nowhere, just like it did on that day. it felt really good to put this all into words and get it off my chest. if anyone has any advice on dealing with this whole thing, i would love to hear it. thank you so much for reading. tl/dr: i was geocaching in the woods and got stung over 150 times by yellow jackets leaving me with debilitating ptsd."

ptsd,depression,716,"my ptsd pretty much consumes my life, i've gone to therapy, they put me on anti depressants but it hasn't gotten much better. i had pretty much lost all hope, until i met this guy at a summer job i worked at. we ended up talking late one night and i learned he had ptsd also, which was very weird considering the only other people at that point i'd met with my problems were online and we ended up kinda bonding over it. we were asking each other things like ""do you have the nightmares too?"" and ""how do you deal with the flashes?"". and we ended up getting into a deep conversation until late that night and we fell asleep in the same bed cuddling. (good time to mention the summer job included room and board) both of us didn't have nightmares that night and got a decent nights rest. after the summer job, we continued talking and found thatriggers and boundaries and know how to properly avoid and respect them. ive had my ptsd for much longer than he has (mine 12 year his a year and a half) and he's glad he has me to help him figure out this thing that is still very new and terrifying to him. it's so hard to explain after so many years of being in fight or flight mode how calming and safe i feel around him. like everything is ok and no one can hurt me. don't get me wrong, it's still in the back of my mind but it's somehow dulled when i'm with him. it's still not perfect tho, especially on nights when he gets toned out for his job and i'm left alone, but i'm glad i can be there for him when he gets back for him to talk through his call and calm his worries. so don't give up, no matter how bad your ptsd might seem, an unexpected solution might be just around the corner."

ptsd,depression,756,recovering from ptsd is a pain in the ass. and like a basket of enraged 400 lb primates throwing shit everywhere there’s some elements about it i was surprised to discover. one of them is how annoyed you’ll feel dealing with bullshit that wasn’t yours to begin with. you’re just a normal person bebopping through life like a bunny in a green field of fresh grasses when along comes some flaming fuckhead shitshow and rains on your parade. wonderful. just fucking wonder-fucking-ful. you didn’t ask ant to get through life without getting triggered. scream at the goddamn duck. be angry. connect with your feels. give a middle finger to toxic masculinity and pour your rage into lifting weights or whatever helps you burn off all that hypergolic fuel so you can function and get one small step closer to that normal life you know you deserve. give voice to the injustice. your anger and rage is justified. it’s ok. connecting to your emotions is work. just like recovery is just work. you got this.
adhd,depression,758,"how often have we heard, ""you just need to try harder,"" or ""i find it boring too, but my parents taught me to stick to it,"" or ""you're smart but so lazy!"" the problem seems to me that for some reason people believe that everyone is capable of the exact same amount of willpower. they accept that people have different levels of intelligence, that a kid who can't solve a math problem as quickly as another could have a lower iq or a learning disability and really needs extra help. we don't blame their moral character for being less intelligent, we accept that it is a function of their brain beyond their control. but with willpower, which is actually just motivation and sustained attention, wes not try his best in most classes."" so now it is the kid's fault. it's really hard for people to accept this because they like to think of their work ethic, their ability to stick with things as a personal victory, as part of their moral fiber. they don't want to think of it as good luck in getting a well functioning brain. what do you think? does this sound accurate to your experience? tl;dr: people see intelligence as a brain function and having a low iq as bad luck. but they see willpower as a character trait taught by good parents and as a personal victory that every person is equally capable of and those with poor motivation and attention as morally flawed or failed by bad parents."
anxiety,depression,760,"i (26 m) am by no means saying that i still don’t feel anxious now and then but i have definitely regained control of my life. i am now living the life that i want to live. no longer is anxiety holding me back from doing anything in life i want to. i am going to try my best to list of a few key points that helped me get to where i am today i no for a fact that i am going to miss out a lot of information just for the fact that it has took a shit ton of little things to get me to where i am. taking time to heal: 1 year ago i made the hard decision to take a break from my toxic job to focus on my own health, this was a super hard decision to make but it enabled me to take the time i need to push myself out of my comfort zone and focus on myself. consistently exercising and eating better: i had no self confidence and was always exhausted so i used to eat junk food most nights just because i felt like shit and the food made me feel worse, now i eat much cleaner, no caffeine alcohol ory day to do something i was uncomfortable doing, some days i would fail but i would try again until i could complete what i had set out to do then more. take experience and tips and tricks from people who have been there before: there is an old saying i can not remember where i heard it but it goes ‘ no man is your friend, no man is your enemy, every man is your teacher’, and basically my interpretation of it is you can learn from any and everyone, and that is what i did i did my own research and reached out to anyone with knowledge about anxiety and panic attack’s and see what they knew about it that i didn’t. i am not writing this to gloat i am writing this so that if even 1 person out there who thinks there is no way out or that life can never go back to ‘normal’ i am living proof that there is, better days are ahead. i hope anyone reading this might find it usually or insightful and if you have any questions leave them below and i will try my best to answer as best as i can."
adhd,depression,762,receiving this diagnosis has opened up so many doors for me that i myself had shut and locked because i never believed i was capable of doing it. treatment has completely transformed my ability to perform academically and i’m eternally grateful for that. my goal is to continue earning a 4.0 so i might have a chance of getting into grad school in a couple years!🙏🏻

bipolar,depression,767,"(reposting from r/bipolar) i was put on sertraline about 4-5 weeks ago (i lose track of time - this is in the uk) and have been buzzing ever since. it kicked in about 3 hours after i took the first pill, i’ve barely slept in weeks, decided i want to move to australia, decided i could book a better package holiday to italy than our travel agent and proceeded to do so, bought a leopard gecko (i do already keep pet lizaple of months ago), and got into an argument with a friend which ended at 3am the next morning, among other things. the gp’s response upon hearing this? “stop taking antidepressants because they’re making you manic, let us figure out what to prescribe you.” so now i’m unmedicated, awaiting new medication, still hyper, due to go on a holiday which i booked in a hyper state, probably going to crash at some point. great."
ptsd,depression,768,"i am in counseling and have been for the last 3 months and was diagnosed with ptsd. the counseling is helping, slowly. i'm meditating, trying to practice more self care and compassion, but letting myself feel my emotions again is... hard. its really hard. i have been numb for the last 1.5 years, because i am really stuck in fight or flight mode. i just need to relate my experience and... i hope this is the right place to do that. right around the beginning of 2017, i got a sore throat. i take immune suppressant drugs to control a chronic illness and my sore throat got so bad that i woke up in the middle of the night because my throat had completely shut closed and i couldn't breath. i ran to the sink, forced down a glass of water and i could breathe maybe 20%. i call 911 and have to shout in short gasps what was happening. i remained conscious for long enough for the emts to make their way into my apartment, but i blacked out after that. the next time i woke up in a *lucid* state was 9 days later in the hospital, incredibly weak. my wrists were comprush to survive, executing a plan that would save my life with more focus than i have every mustered in my life. the second time, i was trying to fight off people who i was convinced were trying to keep me in some kind of nightmare prison. the third time... i was already so weak that by the third time it happened, i remember explicitly hearing the last part of me i could experience, this last little whisper of consciousness- ""i am dying, this is it, this is how my life ends, this is what it has been building up to, i am dying, all i can do is witness this, i am disconnecting from my body."" i had to finish getting my masters and writing a thesis, with classes starting a week after i got out of the hospital. there was no time to cope or process what i had been through. i just shut the fuck down. i am genuinely afraid i will never feel human again. i know they were trying to save my life, but it is a horrifying experience to be strapped down to a bed, choking to death and being wrestled down by a bunch of people. i felt violated and totally dehumanized."
ptsd,depression,770,"long post warning. i have significant issues with being in crowds or around large groups, especially if they are loud and most significantly when there’s alcohol involved. i completely close up, and people just meeting me describe me as quiet when that is absolutely not my personality. i get more attention in veterans groups because i’m in shape and i look like i have it together, but inside i’m screaming and the attention triggers my ptsd problems constantly. put me in a place where people are in my personal space and there’s no talking to me.e evaluating me visually and telling me “i look fine” when 3 tbis and complex ptsd are, by nature, invisible. i feel so alone in this, and judged because my resilience activities, running and lifting, make me appear perfectly normal. i’m desperate to overcome these issues, especially given my profession and the need to operate in crowded conditions. army docs dismiss my problems because i look capable and am a high-achiever despite it all, even questioning whether the incident resulting in my ph “actually happened”. i need someone to believe me."
bipolar,depression,771,i'm coming down from a hypomanic episode and it's just a bad day. i hate these days. i'm not sure who would like these days. i hate who i am. i want to peel my skin off and trade in my organs for new ones. i'm tired and it makes me feel so abnormal. it's a don't drown day. i keep trying to remind myself that it's just right now. &amp;#x200b; sorry for being a downer.
adhd,depression,773,"i’ve been thinking. whenever i tell people i have adhd i always follow it with, “i’ll never use it as an excuse though.” and it just occurred to me that i only do this because so many people would tell me adhd is not an excuse that i started saying it to save face. but adhd is actually, in fact, a very valid excuse. we’re not some cult of hypochondriac, or me not completing my assignments on time, or things that do not affect [*insert condescending person*], etc... i feel like it should be a valid excuse for things like being late, but we’re just conditioned to think it’s not. i mean, why does it feel like the only people who accept this as an actual disorder are people who have it and some doctors?"
anxiety,depression,774,"i took the first step. i’ve been struggling so much for the past few months. it’s gotten to the point that i’m barely sleeping and when i do, i have insane nightmares. a couple weeks ago i booked a therapy appointment and it was today. i stood outside the building and came very close to just leaving because the idea of opening up about what i’m strug; if you’re wondering if you should start looking for a therapist, do it. if you’ve found a therapist that seems interesting but you’re not sure if you should reach out, do it. if you’ve made an appointment but you’re not sure if you should attend, attend it. and if you’re standing outside wondering if you should go in, go in. it will help, i promise."

adhd,depression,776,so the most annoying thing that happens when you have adhd especially when you don't really have much treatment for it is that when my friend asks me why i didn't do a specific task or assignment or something and i tell her the reality which is that i really wasn't able to i couldn't concentrate she goes like well stop givan draw conclutions its not just anything and everything and my dad has been told to take me to a psychaitrist and get meds but he will refuse to and i hate it that he just cant understand my situtation and its so annoying because i can see things shattering because of my adhd and i really dont know what to do about things
ptsd,depression,777,i've started to use cbd oil to manage my anxiety and i feel like a person again. i have energy to both accept any negative feelings i have and still put out a positivity to other people. which is something i struggle with when my anxiety is fully active since it pulls me down and it's difficult for me not to come off nasty when all my energy is spent fighting anxious thoughts and coping with the feelings it creates. i have an easier time talking myself down from my anxious thoughts and can function better in public in general. i can focus when i read and not forget things because i don't have my brain going a mile a minute. this stuff makes me feel like my life has changed drastically. i'm so grateful it exists.

anxiety,depression,781,"making friends is something i'm legitimately unable to wrap my head around. even as my social anxiety has lessened, i *cannot* understand how people do it. the only way i've managed to make friends is having people approach me first, and had they not, i would be completely alone. i feel as though i have some developmental disorder because of how socially impaired i am. going up to someone i don't know and talking to them seems impossible to me, unless it's somewhere like a store or restaurant (which i still struggle with from time to time). not knowing how they'll react scares me, and i feel like any attempt i made at conversation with anyone would result in me embarrassing myself and nothing else."
adhd,depression,783,"i often have people bring up songs/albums/bands or movies/tv shows during conversation. they might say, ""have you seen or heard x?"" and if i have i will say ""yeah, i liked it, enjoyed it etc etc etc"". however, as soon as they go into more details such as band members or actor names, favourite lines from movies or lyrics from songs i can't actually remember any information beyond a couple of bits even though i know i've seen/heard it and i liked it. i fear it makes me appear as a compulsive liar who says they like things just to fit in when in reality i just cannot remember many details, lines, names or lyrics, just i enjoyed said movie/show/album etc. anyone else get this? feelsbadman.jpeg."

ptsd,depression,788,"so right now i'm going through a formal process of bringing ti light some sexual harassment i've suffered, and it's triggered me badly regarding the sexual abuse i endured as a very young adult. i have rarely spoken about it since it happened. i was disssauded from being public about it, and i now realize that those people although well meaning were wrong. because being secret has only added to my shame and has crushed my self esteem. now i'm realizing i want to be more open, but i thought the internet is a good place to start. part of my issue with sharing is that i can't fathom if anyone would have gone through anything equally terrible, although i logically know that of course people have. this story is quite traumatic, so don't read if you're feeling fragile: well i began being groomed by an older man (49) when i was 17. i was (am) autistic and extremely naive and with somewhat neglectful parents so i was the perfect target at age 18 he started with the sexual advances and i was lured into a three year thing you can't even call a relationship because it was so disturbed. he was also married wition order and an eight month battle through the legal system to get one. while i was on the cusp of leaving rhe relationship, i became acutely suicidal because it was so damn hard to get away from him and the people at the mental health center said they'd never seen someone so suidical. this man destroyed my life right on the cusp of adulthood. i never got to complete my university degree because i was trapped under him when i should have been there. also the abuse most likely triggered my health genes, because now i have several quite severe chronic health conditions. i completely lost my ability to trust people, and most of my family and friend relationships have failed. because i can't work, i can't afford proper health care or therapy. i have lost my sense of self under his control with the immense psychological brainwashing and i don't think i'll ever completely get it back or even half, especially without the proper help. i don't live with a victim mentality but i think it's fair to say that this man has pretty much destroyed me. thank you for reading my account because i need to get it out."
ptsd,depression,789,"you know how sometimes something just happens and you never talk about it with anyone, and it just feels like it never happened, like it's not real. ""oh yes that happened once its totally fine and normal to have panic attacks when thinking about it"" i never realised that it was a bad thing, until i told her. and i realised how hard it was to talk about it. i realised how horrible it sounded. when i said it out loud, when i heard it, it sounded so traumatic, even though it seemed so mundane and normal to me in my head. i guess i should give some insight: my cousin is like 26 and a psycho. he raped my aunt, who is 7 years younger than him, when she was a teenager (she's like a sister to me so i want to strangle him) when i was 12, he barged into our house (my dumbass grandma let him in cause ""he's a wonderful man""). my aunt was there too, trying to get him to leave. he made a huge scene, started crying because his girlfriend left him or something, telline back. i think i made all the excuses in the world and speedwalked the fuck outta there. he was shouting after me, asking me what the fuck i think i'm doing. luckily, i was close to my house, so he didn't have much time to chase after me. i got to my house, and my aunt hugged me because she was so worried. we didn't talk about it after that when i told my therapist, she made me realised that he was an actual predator, actually targeting me. i had other instances of him touching me at family reunions (as alabama as that sounds) and now that i know that it actually happened and it was a bad thing, i don't know how to feel. i don't really talk to my family (emotional neglect and occasional abuse) so that was the first time i had an authority figure validate my experiences. sorry if this isn't the right sub, i don't know if this is real ptsd or if i'm just being dumb again, sorry, just needed to type it. i hate how he gets away with everything all the time"

""then fucking quit"" my manager tells me. take another run, burst into tears the second i get into my car, spend 5 minutes composing myself, dry the tears from my eyes, dodge the customers gaze until the very end when i have to say thank you, i mean he gave me some money, i have to look him in the eyes and say thank you. as i walk away he hesitates to close the door, clearly seeing that i had recently been crying. run into the bathroom at work and sit there, pretending to go to the bathroom. try to compose myself, someone knocks, just needing to use the restroom. i clean my face and head out. i stay in the backroom and hide with my face in my hands, whole body shaking. another 10 minutes go by, i walk up to the front and look at my manager, apparently a run had been sitting for 10 minutes and i was supposed to take it. i couldn't see while i was in the backroom. 3 other people at work saw me in this state. i told my manager that i have bipolar disorder and that i'm trying. he said his best friend was bipol completely alien concepts. the inability to recognize the person that's actually you? they don't understand that. i'm not thinking of killing myself, but i'm beyond tired of living. excuse the ranting. there's a lot going on in my head right now, and trying to reign it in isn't helping. thanks for reading. thanks for being there for me, and i'm here for all of you if you need it. helping people helps me, at least i can make a small difference so that people will put up with some of my bullshit. edit: shit. all of this to ask how do you guys hold a job? because i'm having trouble doing that much at domino's. and if i can't do that, then i'm not ready for love and that's killing me. because i fear i'll never be.

""develop coping skills!"" i did. they work for that cycle. then none of them work, then some do, then i completely reinvent my strategy, works for a time, repeat the process. they can use the same coping skills for much closer to life than even the most stable of us. i feel like an outsider. and when this happens i listen to the outsider by guthrie govan. this song, and steven wilson's latest album are my only currently working coping skills. but those 60 minutes while those songs are playing is the only time in my days where i experience peace. how are you guys stable when your brain is a hurricane of emotion? or how do you all maintain the illusion at least? i just don't want people to worry about me because i know this will pass, but i can barely maintain control right now."

ptsd,depression,885,"in 2002 my then boyfriend started abusing me. it began with verbal hostility and escalated to serious physical violence and sexual assault. i was embarrassed and afraid, and decided that i needed to handle this problem by myself and then not tell anyone about it. i succeeded in leaving the relationship in 2003, but not without suffering further trauma (he broke into my new place and killed my small pet). for two years i suffered from serious mental health problems: hypervigilance, anxiety, flashbacks, dissociative states, and nightmares. i went to therapy but withheld the important information about the abusive relationship, leading to several misdiagnosis including bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, and schizoid personality disorder. i still thought that i had to pretend it never happened and that would eventually be the same thing as it never having had happened, and thought i could also get help for the serious problems i was experiencing at the same time. that kind of worked, because the anti anxiety medication i was eventually prescribed in 2005 did give me some relief, and i was able to function again. i felt like things were really turning around. i was able to go to school, hold down a job, and started dating again. i finished college and met the guy i would eventually marry. i stopped going to therapy except to get refills. in 2009 i was accepted to a competitive grad school program. the pressures of the program exposed the mental health problems i had been living with all along, and the fact that they were still interfering with my life. i decided to go to therapy again, but my then fiancé and i had very little money, so i decided to enroll in the program at the university where you could gefew things at a time. and i open doors without fear. also at this point i switched my medication to zoloft, which works so much better for me. i felt like things were really getting better. i was even having less frequent nightmares, which i had had so frequently for so many years i had barely considered it to be something that could change. then on new years eve 2013, i had a terrible panic attack and ended up pacing the house in a dissociative state again thinking a lot of things that weren’t true and not well grounded to reality. my therapist had taught me the trick of holding an icecube to ground yourself in such a situation, and that had always worked like magic for me. my poor husband kept shoving icecubes into my hands. i would clench them until they melted and continue to pace, panicked and agitated. thankfully after the third icecube i came around. i again felt extremely discouraged and started to despair that i would have to live with ptsd symptoms for the rest of my life, all over a stupid, terrible thing that happened to me now over a decade ago. in nearly 3 years since that incident i have had one brief flashback (when opening a door coming out of a stairwell). i continue to be hypervigilant and anxious, but i no longer have panic attacks, flash backs, dissociative states, or night mares. i cannot believe how much easier life is without all those things, and i will never take it for granted. so that is my journey, 14 years long. my hope is that it is encouraging to people still struggling with severe symptoms. i hope it is not discouraging to people who have struggled longer than i have and still not found relief. my heart goes out to you, and i hope you find treatment that works for you soon."

ptsd,depression,902,"i'm just curious how everyone else handles the topic of their ptsd when it comes to dating. i'm at a point now where i take a minimal amount of medication and only have mildly disruptive symptoms so it's more like a thing that comes up after i've been seeing someone for awhile and they ask what i take my prescription for or comment on some slightly odd behavior or reaction etc. but the thing that bothers me about it is it seems like i can never just say ""oh i have ptsd"" and leave it at that. people always want to know what happened to you, and i don't necessarily want to share the worst memories of my life with just anyone. how do you deal with these sorts of interactions?"
bipolar,depression,903,throwaway because i'm vaguely paranoid about this for some reason. i had a bad manic episode last month and during the course of it decided it would be a great idea to pay someone to write my all papers for my classes this semester. it cost an arm and a leg and ike at night cringing over sometimes. but this was a new one for me. and it got me wondering what weird/regrettable/awful things others have done while manic. i know this is probably insanely tame compared to what some have experienced but i'm pretty mad at myself.
anxiety,depression,904,"i know i have anxiety, i’ve been prescribed xanax before, had a doctor tell me “you have anxiety,” and have almost every symptom including panic attacks. yet i can’t help but feel that my anxiety is not valid, or that i don’t feel “anxious” enough and i don’t deserve any help for it. whenever i relax in the day, just reading or scrolling through my phone i can feel my stomach begin to twist and i begin to chide myself, “how can i be relaxed if i have an anxiety disorder?” i feel like i’m faking it, deluding myself, trying to piggy back off people with this disohard, my struggles are nothing compared to theirs. i bottle it up, pretend i’m okay, i feel ashamed talking about my feelings to them because who on earth am i talk? i feel anxious? they’re probably having a panic attack talking to me and the thought just sends fear spiking through me because i’m scared of seeming weak or clingy and seeming selfish for admitting i struggle. i know these thoughts are irrational, hello anxiety! yet i can’t stop them and i’m just wondering if any of you have experienced something like this and how you deal with thoughts like these?"

[cheap also look like shit. if you wear one of those [plastic you scream australien or american. don't get one of those ridiculous hats. just try to fit in. edit: dirndl tips for women and men: ribbon on the left side: single right side: in a relationship. middle: virgin. never seen that before though. back: husband dead. **some more tips:** * know your limit. the doctors located on the oktoberfest grounds are expensive. if you feel like throwing up, leave the tent ( just don't get to that point. ruins the fun for you, your friends and anyone withing a circle of 3 tables if you puke at your place.) you should get shitfaced, but just don't throw up. otherwise you will end up on this website: * don't harass the girls. you will end up at the police station faster than you can chug a beer (the pros chug a beer in ten seconds) * don't make trouble. [here you can see how munich police and securities handles * don't start a fight. get security if there is trouble. * if you want the beers faster tip your waiter. 10 euros for a table should do. 20 if the waiter hates you. * keep your wallet in a safe pocket. leave passports at the hotel. only take a copy of it with you. it is also good if you leave your credit card at the hotel. everything is cash anyways. get some money before you go to the oktoberfest. source: been living in munich since i was born. got drunk at the oktoberfest the first time at the age of 14. went there with my parents since the age of 0. disclaimer. if you don't manage to get in a tent because of my advice, don't blame me. if they let you in and how crowded it gets can be unpredictable. those tips come from my personal experience."
ptsd,depression,909,"it’s ironic and frustrating, because i spend 99% of the time hyper-vigilant and on edge, but when i’m in a situation that actually could be dangerous, suddenly i become naive and trusting and vulnerable. i look back on times when i trusted somebody who in hindsight i absolutely should not have trusted, i just apparently ignored the million red flags, and i gave out personal information that i shouldn’t have, and potentially seriously endangered myself. i never realize what happened until i look back on it afterwards and i feel like a complete idiot."

(possible rape) and shit went haywire. my eldest brother (now 14,15 or so) became very abusive. he got verbally, physically and eventually sexually. he taught 5 year old me to masturbate, made me do it until i vomited. he'd hit me if i ran away. he eventually taught me about girls/my sisters. i'm not sure how it started (probably blocked it out of my mind due to ptsd) but i began to have sex with my sisters conscentual and not. i was 5/6 years old. i hated myself. my brother would sometimes watch, then call me a peice of shit and say i was going to hell. at 7 i started playing with fire, one day i w i was used to people rejecting me, so used to it i became perversely ""in love"" with it. i did all i could to try and make her get rid of me, show her that i only deserved pain (which i truly believed, and sometimes still do) i gave her hell, yelled tell her i hated her. i never hurt her physically but i hurt he emotionally and verbally. this is what reactive attachment disorder is like (one of my diagnosis) it basically makes it very difficult for someone to feel like they can accept love, so much so that they are willing to hurt to prove themselves right. its fucking horrible, i dont wish it on my worst enemy. luckily my mom is the goat and has stuck through it to the point where i'm at college now. however i still think about my trauma every day, and it affects me so much so that i'm really bad with relationships (friends and romantic). i feel like a horrible person, even though all the stuff i did i had no real control over or even knew was wrong. i still hate myself for what i put my mom through and i fucking hate that i still want a relationship with my bio family. i'm fucking friends on facebook with my eldest brother. it sucks that i was the one to be put on his own out of all my siblings and i was the one that had to go through so many families. i fucking hate it. anyways just wantex to get that shit off my chest"

adhd,depression,944,"i was just diagnosed last week (at 36 years old) and have been reading a lot, trying to understand this thing that i've unknowingly been battling for my entire life. this small section in the book driven to distraction by edward m. hallowell m.d. spoke to me so strongly i thought i would share in hopes that it might speak to others on the same path. it's a quote from one of his patients. &gt; “oh,” she answered, “that is about a cough drop someoneto greet me when i got into the car the next morning, jeff was with me. i looked at the cough drop and burst into tears. jeff asked me why i was crying, and i told him it was because of the cough drop. he thought i was losing my mind. ‘but you don’t understand,’ i said, ‘my whole life is like that. i see something that i mean to do and then i don’t do it. it’s not only trivial things like the cough drop; it’s big things, too.’ that is why i cried.”"
ptsd,depression,945,"i typed out a whole long vent post but then realized i really just wanted to know if anyone else had the same problem. my ex is the first out of many different guys who respected my boundaries and always made sure that our sex was fully consensual. we dated for a year, broke uherapy and that i will eventually find a man i can trust, although i am worried that i'll run into the wrong men before i find him. i'm just curious - how many of you have gotten too attached to people who treated you well after your diagnosis (or after you developed symptoms)?"
anxiety,depression,946,"seriously. a minute ago, i was shoveling food into my mouth. i felt like i had a billion things to do at the moment, even though in reality i had a lot of time to do those things. i felt light headed and my heart was racing. in the moment i realized that there was no point in rushing and decided to take my time eating. as soon as i started to slow down, my anxiety instantly improved. i didn't feel 100%, but i felt more calm and less overwhelmed than before. it's weird how a simple thing like eating slowly can change things up. (forgive me if this is an obvious lpt. it's certainly not new because i've been told it countless times, but i've often overlooked it. hopefully this will help those of you who overlooked it as i have.)"

adhd,depression,962,"since reading about adhd in the past year in girls, it has really opened my eyes. yes other people feel like this. however, does anyone have moments of panic when you do concentrate on something and think “oh my god i probably don’t have adhd because i was able to function?!” and then panic that all the times that you weren’t able to ‘function’ were due to you being lazy/ stupid/ immature? i want to get some sought of clarity on where i’m at (i haven’t been diagnosed) however i’m just so scared that my diagnosis will be “yeh man you’re just a lazy sod, ain’t nothing wrong with you bucko” so i’m procrastinating on it. any thoughts ?"

anxiety,depression,985,"around 4 years ago, i went through the worst anxiety i have ever been through. i didn't understand what was wrong with me and thought i was dying. i couldn't be left alone or go outside without going through a panic attack. i would convince myself that every lump i felt was cancerous and make numerous visits to the hospital only for them to send me home after hours of waiting. i was prescribed diazepam/beta blockers and almost prescribed citalopram but i only choose to take 2 diazepam and that was it. during this time i told my mum that i wanted to be sectioned because i believed that i wasn't in control of myself and was uned to do. within the past 2 and a half years i have attended job interviews, bank/doctor appointments and completed a mathematics course. i now do my own food shopping, have a part-time job which is a customer-facing role and i'm in the process of working with a job agency to get a better job. to cut a long story short, i have went from having severe agoraphobia and panic attacks (-4 years ago) to working a part-time job and doing everything for myself. i'll probably delete this post in few hours but i hope it helps somebody on here who feels like their life will never change. i'm also open to any questions, if there are any."

bipolar,depression,990,i am pretty stable on meds right now and could probably pass as not having a disability. the exception is if i need to take time off in the future for breakout episodes that would put me over my vacation/sick day allowance. in that case i assume i need to use ada accommodations. i was talking with my pdoc the other day and i aske will take time off before it gets to that point. but at the same time i might need to take more time off than i have available in my contract if i have breakout episodes. but there is already an example of this potential problem. does anyone know the pros and cons of legally having a disability in the context of bipolar disorder?

ptsd,depression,1001,"her (20something female) and i (26f) are in a ptsd php program together. she has did (for those of you that don’t know, dissociative identity disorder, which is the new name of multiple personality disorder. when she dissociates she has various “parts” that may emerge, her most common part is a little girl) and dissociates into one of her identities on a daily basis. i know very little about her history because you even mention the word “abuse” and she’s gone. it’s so sad. i’ve been offering her support outside of program hours and we’ve become close; she has started reaching out to me without prompts when she is struggling which makes me happy that she feels that comfort with me. today was huge for her and i’m so incredibly proud of her, we did a guided meditation today in our final group. as soon as we were told that was happening i turned to her and mouthed “will you be okay?” because every time we’ve done meditation in the past she dissociatciate, and she reminds me a lot of myself about 4 years ago. i was at an inpatient treatment center and dissociated almost everyday and was completely hopeless. but i had people there to encourage me, just like i’m trying to do for her. all i want to do is give her a big bear hug but that’s a no-no so instead i gave her a bad ass high five. people:: there is hope. there is so much hope and there is always hope and if you can’t see it right now, find someone who can see it and try, even just a little, to believe them. i know it’s there because i am drastically better than when i started on the recovery journey. maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, maybe not even next month, but little by little you will start to see the hope that is there, and that has always been there. keep fighting, all of you have it in you. if anyone ever needs an encouraging word or someone to vent to, i am happy to help support you. my heart goes out to all of you. peace ✌️"

none,depression,1006,"some friends thought it would be fun to see sting play and tickets are pricey ($94), but it's kind of a bucket list act that i've always wanted to see. they get added to the cart as $94 + fees per ticket on the ticket selection page, which you would think would come out to be $400 or so ding a charge but there is no way to remove it and when you call, you get told the volume of calls is too high for you to talk to an operator so it disconnects. each ""advance admission"" ga ticket is $194! so 4 tickets x $94 = $376 that means that the fees are $466.75! this is outrageous."
bipolar,depression,1009,"there was a post here a bit ago asking ""can you feel the depression coming on?"" i've had a long history of really disliking my therapists. however, at one point one of them told me the best thing i can do is keep a log of how i'm feeling. i don't see them any more, i barely saw them 2 or 3 times, but i've kept that idea in mind for a while. usuallening. i think the next step for me is to recognize unhealthy hypomanic self destruction, and ask for help from someone that cares about me. when i'm thinking about seeking out unhealthy foods to destroy my weight loss goals, i'll ask my s.o. to cook dinner with me. i think something like that could really help prevent me from falling into the pit."

bipolar,depression,1063,"so in the title, within quotation marks, are what i've heard from people i spent the most time with. 1) my mom, 2) a now-ex boyfriend, and 3) a former friend. 1) my mom kinda blew up in the parking lot of a hospital. the doctor said i didn't need a cough pill for my infection, and would be fine with only the prescription she gave me, and then my mom asked if she could prescribe me with a cough syrup. the doctor agreed to prescribe a strong cough syrup, and i asked if i don't need a cough pill, ""do i need cough syrup?"" the doctor said no, but said ""the medicines won't react with one another,"" and ""if you want a cough syrup, i can prescribe one."" *but i don't.* my cough won't go away (respitory infection) until the steroids kick in, but it will go away. i don't like taking meds i don't need. i'm defensive about this, because every time i have respitory issues, my mom asks the doc for a cough syrup ""for my own good"" and i feel like shit bc it's got some depressive drug in it, and i feel ultra sluggish the morning after i take it. i don't need it so i'm adverse to taking it. my mom says it's ridiculous that i have a cough and won't take a cough syrup, when no cough syrup was prescribed or suggested. the steroids will take it's course. but mothers will be mothers. i just hate taking drugs i don't actually need. (and i'm 18 so i'd think the doctor would have asked me first. guess not.) anyway she called me ungrateful and wouldn't let me speak and i dunno. it hit me. she said: ""i'm better off dead than i am alive to you, because nothing i do as your mother makes you happy."" i wanted to shoot myself in the mouth right there and then, ngl. i know that isn't the (logical) answer to this, but she isn't the only one who's said stuff like this. 2) my ldr boyfriend of two years broke up with me last night. he says he doesn't feel like he can talk to me, because he says offhanded things, and for a while, i didn't address them until months later (which is toxic). and now he feels that he'll fuck up no matter what he does, so what's the point. in the past i've addressed things as they came up and he either made fun of me, got super defensive, or asked ""so what's the problem?"". for example: he didn't speak to me for long periods of time. for like. a year. cancelled majority of skype dates at the last second. i said that i knew he has other obligations, but that still felt a bit emotionally neglected. (being left on read for days and sometimes weeks, not hearing from him for months, reading an ""i love you, too"" from him was rare. i felt like he didn't like me.) but he said that i had no reason to believe that. he had a roommate who made me cry, and he didn't defend me. even if i say that i didn't appreciate a comment, he would just join him. of course, he didn't mean to be rude, and of course he didn't mean to overlook my crying, didn't mean to misunderstand me. but he refused to buy earbuds because of his ""indispoable income"" (even if he went out to drink once a month). which gave his roommate ammo to be a bully. so i mailed my then-bf earbuds and he lost them. it felt as if he didn't put any effort into the relationship, and was justifying himself. when i asked if he wanted to break up, he sounded surprised and confused as to why. said that he loves me. i wasn't angry, just hurt and confused with all the mixed messages. but i said i believed him and ignored my gut. plus, on holidays, he drives six hundred miles in one go to visit me (and his family. so contrary to what he says, i'm not the only reason he comes to the city i live in.) but he said ""you think i wanna see my family? barely anyone there wants to see me. i'm driving for nine hours straight just so see you. of course i love you."" he gave multiple examples of his responsibilities, asked if i understood, and still asked what the problem is. i couldn't teents to me and to other people. i understand how depression can be; but that doesn't excuse her from being mean. from playing rough and with scissors (as a seventeen year old). from going out of her way to patronize people. but she put on her snapchat story her suicidal thoughts, talking about how everyone she knows is against her. so i swiped up, let her know that i apologize if i wronged her, and that i want her to be okay. that i don't think anyone is against her. that i am here if she needs to talk. she said that i can't make her pity me, and i was baffled. that she doesn't have the energy for my bullshit. (yikes.) that i shouldn't play nice if i don't feel nicely about a person. (still don't know what's she was talking about but it was childish. but still yikes.) and then she said all i do is complain about my family problems and boyfriend and do nothing to fix it. (that was when i said ""good to know,"" and blocked her. hehe.) it's so funny that she *asked me* what's wrong, didn't accept ""nothing"" for an answer, and then secretly hated when i was open and honest. i thought she was my friend. but i guess only therapists are meant to hear your problems. anyway. i digress. days after i blocked her, she came around me in person. went out of her way to sit next to me. acted fearful, as if i would reject her. took every single chance she got to be overly nice. for example: i was presenting and the class (of 13 people) was talking over me. she stood up, cupped both hands over her mouth, and projected: ""everyone! chris is talking! it is important to hear what they say, so that they can finish their presentation!"" sat down, then grinned at me. the class had the same weirded-out expression as i did. like. ugh. that was so artificial that it hurt me. i have a floridan friend who i tell some of these situations with, and he says it sounds like the other person has some unsolved problems of their own. my therapist said the same thing about all three scenarios. that nothing i complain about is like. ""i'm so sad my dad got me a blue car. i wanted a red one."" y'know? like the problems that bother me are literally ""so i'm homeless and don't know where i'm sleeping tonight "" or ""i got 27 spider bites in my sleep"" or ""my mom is threatening to kick me out and i'm an unemployed student"" or something that can't be given advice, because it's totally out of anyone's control. like when my car got totalled and i kept having flashbacks about the crash throughout the day. i couldn't sleep at night. for weeks. or when three of my classmates died. or when i was in a sexually abusive relationship for six months, got assaulted everyday on school grounds, and didn't tell anyone for eight months. i have flashbacks and awful dreams about *that* one to this day. but i don't say anything until someone asks me what's wrong. and even if they do, i'm reluctant to say so. bc none of this can be hugged better. it's heavy. it's uncomfortable and nobody wants to hear it. those are the only things that get to me. those are the things i go to therapy for. but my therapist doesn't believe in dwelling on (talking about) past traumas and griefs. i don't know what anyone wants me to do anymore. do i just let go of *everything*? i do not exagerrate; these things happened in the same twelve months. i'm not trying to excuse my complaints, but, yikes. i don't know what to make of any of this. anyway. tldr: nobody i open up to stick around. are all of these situations like. situations where both parties have made acceptable mistakes in handling their situation? or am i this unhappy person who makes people miserable because i complain so much? am i ungrateful? am i being crazy for saying the things i do? does anyone else hear statements like these from people who see you the most? it's times like these that makes self destructive behavior so easy."

ptsd,depression,1125,"i found this thread online today. i thought it was interesting. it's crazy to read that ~50% of people who were raped had an orgasm or had their body respond (i'm guessing that those whose bodies responded in even smaller/minute ways is approaching 95%). (i'm guessing that child sexual abuse has similar numbers). i think that this is an issue that if we can have a frank discussion about it can allow many people to find healing and freedom from shame. it would be fantastic if societally we can address the fact that i believe most rapists are actually specifically setting out trying to make their victims orgasm or feel some pleasure (against their will) in order to humiliate, confuse and traumatize them. not all rapists are taunting their victims with the words, ""you enjoyed it"" but i think the vast majority of the rapists are trying to communicate this idea to their victims with the action of rape. (sometimes i wonder what it fit them or fit with their purposes ? why do rapists choose to rape (i.e. cause sexual pleasure) rather than do another type of assault that would be totally painful (and have no potential for pleasure) such as beat someone else up ? why is rape in particular so attractive to rapists as a form of torture ? what gives rape its power ? i mean after all a lot of rape is not physically violent. what makes rape sexually violent ? i also believe that this should lead to a larger societal discussion that we should question sexual pleasure in many contexts and see that it can be extremely traumatic, and a powerful means of breaking people down, a means of torture violence and controlling them. if there is a hint of sexual pleasure people can easily be convinced to believe they consented to a sexual encounter where they did not or where there was some kind of power imbalance.

bipolar,depression,1138,"dialectical behavior therapy aims to balance accepting things as they are with aiming for positive change. the main disciples in dbt are mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, emotional regulation, and distress tolerance. each day (if i can keep this up) we will discuss an exercise from one of these topics. the first and most basic distress tolerance skill in my book is distraction. distraction gives you time to create an appropriate response to pain or impulse by temporarily stoping you from thinking about the pain or impulse. distraction is different from avoidance because you still intend to deal with the situation in the future, when you are more ready. sometimes for me if i can distract myself from emotional pain the pain passes on it's own with no further action necessary. an example would be when i get worse depression at night - by morning i f and i've already exercised a lot today). browsing redding will distract me from an impulse. here is a hypothetical example (it's not relevant now, but it will be later). i am bipolar and i am depressed. i want to kill myself now, but i will probably feel better in the morning. i will call my uncle and talk on the phone to distract myself from the pain. if he doesn't pick up, i will pet my dog. it is ok to cry. feel free to type out more than one example. it might be a good idea to do one for feeling up and one for feeling down. this post was guided by the dialectical behavior therapy skills workbook by mckay, wood, and brantley, but it is original content. if you share credit ssnakeggirl and the dialectical behavior therapy skills workbook or you're plagiarizing big time. the book is $11 new and $4 used, so if you want your own copy it's very accessible."

adhd,depression,1155,"my doctor prescribed something very unorthodox as a cure for my horrible adhd related depression. while my medicine always would treat my adult adhd, it never treated my depression. i never could escape myself- my mile per minute mind focused in on my shortcomings, my opinion of myself and how i felt others felt of me. so my doctor prescribed to me- a dog. he recommended a belgian malinois- the quintessential military dog. mostly due to its stereotypical adhd like behavior- high energy, high drive to follow organized orders and easily bored in the hands of the wrong person. i did not get a belgian malinois because most pups are around $1.6k. so i listened to his runner up choices- a border collie or a german shepherd. so i did my research, and was about to save a 9 month old german shepherd from the pound. the owner decided that the day of the sale, he was just going to not talk to me. the day after the original sale date, i was on the hunt for another german shepherd. i instead found a steal- almost 2 hours away was a family of people who had imported czech working line german shepherds. they were selling unregistered puppies for $225 as a mother's day special. i drove that whole way at around 8 in the morning, and held every one of the 7-8 week old litter until one of the pups was so calm and lovable that it hurt my heart. my leyna, a german name meaning ""little angel,"" rode home with me that day. she only cried when my friend got out of the car (she lived only 15 minutes from me by foot, but she was also pregnant so i just gave her a lift back home.) you might be wondering why i gave the whole origin story of my puppy, rather than explaining how she fixed my depression. there's two answers to this: 1) i'm heavily intoxicated because i taught my little leyna how to do a toast with me (i hit her water bowl with my shot glass and she laps up water when i take the shot) 2) i'm not 100% sure how it worked, or how he time flew by. i've had her for two weeks now. i'm still unemployed, i'm still single, and my friends totally use me like they always have, but i don't care anymore. the truth is, this puppy has so completely engrossed my life and accomplishes something better than any high or any medicine could- the satisfaction of progression. i wake up, and everyday my puppy grows more attached to me and becomes smarter and smarter. she is at the 8/9 week age now- her ears are starting to stand, and she's understanding the world. i'm understanding her world too. the amount of knowledge, time, and effort it requires to care for her and give her love has completely destroyed any form of self loathing. while i still may harbor negative feelings or thoughts about myself, they no longer eat up the negative spame- and i feel lucky to have such a smart companion. **tl;dr: puppies/dogs are amazing for curing depression, because unlike medicines and coping methods, your puppy/dog requires you to exist. in order to properly raise your canis lupus familiaris, you need to socialize, feed and train it. it shatters your mental barrier of artificial isolationism. if you have adhd and are depressed, dogs and adderall can help you as well.** note: i understand that some might take medicine for depression that is very effective, and i am not bashing that in the slightest. i personally didn't like taking anything except my adderall due to the other effects it had on my personality- drugs like respiradone which i was prescribed following an overdose and the rapid depression and paranoia there after, helped me immensely but i felt like a zombie- i would twitch and shake, especially at the crevices of my mouth which made me look like i was making a fake smile off and on, for about an hour. the adopting of a puppy or dog however is completely different. i'm a very irresponsible person by my nature, but something about a crying puppy makes my personal adhd limits not exist. no legal drug nor high can replicate the feeling of success that is achieved whenever you and your canine companion make a new step on the journey of understanding eachother and new tricks/training. this post isn't meant to offend, however it is meant to present a viable option for those struggling that are uncomfortable with most antidepressants/antipsychotics...like myself. if my post failed to make any sense, i apologize. i am extremely intoxicated at the given moment, but i felt that these past weeks of success needed to be uncovered for others that suffer like me. like seriously, i thought my therapist was full of shit and that he was just making it up as he went along to keep me from doubting him...yet, here i am. proud friend and primary educator of a german shepherd puppy that has completely destroyed my depression by introducing a host of responsibilities. if you are lost in an endless abyss of self loathing and hatred like i was, then get a puppy or a dog and make sure that you alone are the caregiver. if others do the work for you, then i feel that the the whole sene of reward when the puppy/dog grows as an individual is lost. i'm anxious to hear how others feel, peace out for the night/morning of the 20th of may (and teach your dogs to toast with you- smirnoff filled shot glass to water filled doggie bowl....) and may all of you that are like me, find similarly simple and fulfilling purposes/reasons for living...as i have :) edit: [here's some photos of my puppy; the two in the car are from the day i got her, the other two were on mother's day"

anxiety,depression,1157,"this should be a celebratory post but i've spent two days awake, shaking, throwing up or otherwise... i don't know if i can do it but i can't live the hell of staying in our 1 bedroom apartment any longer. i got hired at an oil and vinegar bar, and i really want to work there because i cook a lot and  shopped there i dreaded when the employees bombed me with information. so yeah, i work at 2 tomorrow expecting to not last the 2 week probation period. everything i'm studying just gets lost in my head and i retreat back to my no window bedroom calm down. but i can't lose my car or stay in this house."
anxiety,depression,1158,"i wrote a reply to someone elsewhere about my anxiety -- and it made me think about finally speaking about it more publicly. perhaps some people can benefit from my long, embarrassing, terrifying journey. the pictures in this post merely represent improvement over time, although the video would help a lot more, i am not sure if i should publish them or not, at least yet. my journey with anxiety still continues after five years, but at varying points i have had improvements. i lost a job as a result of anxiety, and gradually anxiety took over my life, ending up pure agoraphobic. i did not leave my house for 3 months, and then a few months later i agreed to take fluoxetine (prozac). i started at a mere 1mg because i believed that the medication would make me worse, and result in my death. gradually i rose it over a few weeks until i [finally took my first full to be honest, it gave me headaches but i did sometimes get a feeling of different peace. but then i would often feel quite hyperactive. i started walking to places again, but was probably still using a lot of alcohol at the time. at certain times i would also use propranolol but was convinced it would also kill me. one day i managed to have dental work done, but they gave me 2 diazepam (10mg). the feeling from those finally gave me a feeling of freedom for the firsr the first time and went ...maybe 1/4 of a but that was a success also. i'm a bit more stable these days, however i have relapsed on benzos. at the end of the day benzos are *fucking effective*. they are the gold standard for anxiety. the problem i have right now is i probably should taper but tbh i do not see the point right now -- as i am presently on sertraline still, including ~30-40mg propranolol, ~400mg pregabalin and 10-30mg diazepam. i eventually overcame my fear of propranolol and it actually proved fairly useful. infact in some cases it is more useful than a benzo... sort of. today i am slightly more stable imo, and propranolol and diazepam and pregabalin maintain stability for now. i'd like to try and just decrease all of the drugs in my system. although some people take way more than me :) recently i finally had the courage to travel in a car to other places. [i sat in a city and had no anxious thoughts. i was i am determined to beat this, and i hope my story and pictures can illustrate how when you are in your darkest moment, [there is a chance to see the you can get better, although i am still on that journey myself. we must learn from each other. personally i am slowly coming to terms with the idea i may eventually die, and as such have prepared this however i am determined to live. good luck to you all."

adhd,depression,1160,"for example, there’s so many items and guns left behind in places you raid in fallout and i just can’t leave the place without literally doing every side thing, killing every guard and getting the best equipment. what happens from that is it takes me ages to play the game which leads me to give up without finishing the story line. sorry mods if this is a faq or common post, i just am bad at researching lol"
anxiety,depression,1161,"it's always been something i have feared but it's got so much worse since developing anxiety. i think it stems down to the fact i had a tooth removed when i was only 5. doesn't sound like a big deal but my mum didn't tell me i had to have it removed till the actual day. she just woke me up and got me in the car and told me we were going to the hospital (the children's dentist was at the hospital) so they could put me asleep and remove my tooth. obviously at 5 that seemeack (tooth decay i'm guessing) i terrified they will just pull it out. anxiety is really making all my fears worse and not to mention the thought of going into the office and lying down while someone prods around in my mouth, i have severe social anxiety so many situations like dentist and doctors appointments make me nervous enough as it is. i don't know what to do i'm going to ask my mum to book an appointment but i won't be able to stop panicking till it's all sorted."

bipolar,depression,1172,"i can’t count how many times i’ve fallen into the trap of thinking i am finally “cured”, stopped my meds, and plummeted into a down cycle. not wanting to be bipolar doesn’t change the fact that you are. now that i am committed to staying stable through constant chemistry and therapy, i can see the lies i’ve told myself for years. i consider this post a public service announcement, and some self-reinforcement - lol. betcha there are plenty of you here who can relate. we are all different, yet we’re the same."
ptsd,depression,1173,"i’m a young girl who has clearly never been in the military and my ptsd is child abuse related. my service dog was a rescue from a shelter and we hired a dog trainer to get him up to certification. he has been extremely helpful especially when i’m out alone and i flash, but when people who are not my close friends ask what he’s for i cringe and say it’s for epilepsy. (which i know is horrible) ied him (which was not easy to do) and he said “i know i was just making a joke” idk, i feel like i’m pretty good about making jokes to lighten the mood and i enjoy dark humor but this one really caught me off guard. i can’t just keep lying about what he is for, especially if i actually use him and it’s obvious that’s not what going on, or worse someone thinks i’m having a seizure. idk what to do."
bipolar,depression,1175,"my parents aren't bad people, but i don't think they've tried to understand my situation. they seem to just view me as lazy and workshy, because i have been able to do other things, like go across the country getting jobs, and making plans to start on courses and work full time at the same time, and this past weekend i went scuba diving, but i've struggled to find work, and i just left the job i only started last week. maybe they've got their minds stuck on depression and thinking i should be bed bound and unable to do anything, but in reality i have been doing much better since i got sober, and i'm building up to a normal level, i just wasn't ready ford work, but i'm not expecting that to happen. i'm in a grim sort of limbo, i just want to hide in my bed, because i can't stand the way my parents are viewing me right now. i started crying about it all this morning in public, not the actions of a mentally sound person. edit: well getting books in the hope my parents would read them has turned into them yelling at me and one saying they don't want to know, the other saying they've been through it, which he hasn't, not properly clinical depression as far as i know (and i did ask previously about family history) and certainly not bipolar. i'm going to just hide here in my room now. i feel pretty unwelcome."
none,depression,1176,title pretty much sums it all up. i haven't done very much traveling during my life and i really want to do some now that i have a great job with good pay and that allows me flexible time off. i figured i could get some advice or suggestions about major us destinations that get commonly suggested. i'd really appreciate it. thanks!

anxiety,depression,1182,"while the titles is pretty self explanatory, i’ll elaborate a little bit. my anxiety has gotten so bad that any time i go to add something to a conversation (whether irl or online) my brain just immediately starts telling me that what i have to say doesn’t matter. it could literally be me commentin my brain that there are people who do value my opinions and what i have to add to the conversation. but it’s at the point that it’s starting to effect my personal and professional development in life and it’s just this massive hurdle that i can’t seem to get over. has anybody else experienced this?"
anxiety,depression,1183,"i made the call to a place to finally seek some help. i was honest with the lady on the phone and it felt good knowing that i (we!!!) are not alone in this!! i know i will not always feel like this and i hang on to that thought and for now, that's what is getting me through this tough time. may all who read this know that this too shall pass and if anyone needs someone to talk to, i am here to listen."

none,depression,1208,"hello, as evident from my trip to the congo, virunga national park is catching a lot of people's attention lately as an alternative to rwanda and uganda for gorilla trekking, hopefully this can answer anyone's questions who is considering a similar trip. **border crossing** i flew into kigali and took the bus to gisenyi/rubavu (many places in rwanda have multiple names, people will know what you're talking about regardless of the one you use but busses will list destinations using the official name which in this case is rubavu). getting to the bus park is easy, every moto taxi or regular taxi in the city will know it. i stayed at the discover rwanda youth hostel; i had mototaxis ask anywhere from 500rwf-700rwf (0.60-0.90usd). if you have a bigger backpack then a regular taxi will be a much more comfortable, though less thrilling option, however those used to the mototaxis in uganda will find their rwandan counterparts drive more cautiously and provide helmets for their passengers. i was charged 10usd by the taxi to go from the hostel to the bus park and 4usd to make the return journey. considering gas here is similar to my native canada (1.10usd/l) 4$ for the 10 minute journey seemed rather low. once you enter the bus park, tens of men will approach you asking you where your destination is and take you to their company, they will also carry your bag for a small fee if you'd like. virunga express was reccomended to me and they proved trustworthy. the ride to gisenyi/rubavu takes 3.5 hours and costs 3000rwf (3.75usd). virunga express makes 3 stops along the way and has busses leave on every half hour. once you arrive at the bus station in gisenyi there is a border crossing just down the street, this is *not* the border crossing you want, you will want to head to the grande barrière which is about a 5 minute mototaxi (400rwf/0.50usd) away. once you get there, there is a small building where people are lining up directly opposite the border, line-up under ""departures"" to get your rwandan exit stamp. if you have an east african visa this *is* multi-entry so you will have no problems getting back into rwanda. if not you will need to have a multi-entry rwandan visa, however some citizens (us and uk notably) can purchase single entry visas at the border. after that head across the border on your on the left and then head to the building to the right of the border (facing goma). the yellow fever/health check (they ask you how you're feeling, if you've been to south america in the last two weeks and take your temperature) is on the far right of the building. i applied for my visa with virunga national park which i imagine 99% of people will. i handed over my letter from the park and passport, was told to wait 10 mins and received my visa (a series of stamps) after the wait. i had no problems and was never asked for any bribes. however i have heard stories of people with older yellow fever cards have been forced to purchase and receive a new vaccine at the border. also worth noting, i entered on may 31st however my entry stamp was not very legible and seemed to say, ""may 1st,"" this did not cause me any problems leaving june 3rd, no one accused me of overstaying my, i believe, 14 day visa. **goma** goma is a chaotic city covered in the lava rock left over from the 2002 nyiragongo eruption that wiped out 40% of the cnd half increases in the slope a bit with the last 300m being a real calf burner. the views from the top of lake kivu and goma are absolutely amazing and the lava lake itself, what you came here for, is indescribeable. we were very fortunate to have 3 hours of clear weather before the clouds rolled in and it was a 3 hours i will never forget. i've been all over the world and can't compare it anything else i've seen or experienced. it is brutally cold but the faint scent of sulphur in the air and the heat coming off the lake below will warm your heart. i was climbing with a missouri couple on their honeymoon who had a kenyan guide, he told me to expect the most incredible night of my life, and that it was. i took the overnight package from the mikeno lodge, they provide you with a cook who will make you a delicious dinner and standard breakfast (egg and sausage) at the top. my entire stay they were very accomodating of my dietary requirements (no dairy) and this was no exception. they give you a massive backpack with fruit, sandwiches, 8 0.5l water bottles, a sleeping bag, a windbreaker, a poncho, a blanket, and a rain cover. i already had a backpack so i shoved all the fruit and water into mine, left everything besides the sleeping bag at mikeno (i was fairly well prepared with the other stuff already) and carried just that up the mountain, leaving my poor porter with the rest. porters are 24usd for the up and down trip plus a tip, i highly reccomend the service if you have all your stuff like me. there is a place to lock you stuff away at the trail head which i only learned of once i got there. no idea of there is a fee. leaving to come down the mountain starts at 7am sharp, i tried to get up at 5:15 for the sunrise but it was much too cloudy. finally there are now permanent ""tents"" made of wood and plastic (? not a materials savvy person) that actually retain your body heat inside quite well. after being freezing when i went to bed i ended up stripping down to just boxers and a t-shirt. **final remarks** expect to pay a lot in tips, how much is completely up to you but the standard seems to be to tip all your drivers, rangers, porters and guides which begins to add up very quickly. the park staff will drop you off at the border after, even making a stop if you want to purchase some local coffee or cheese. i'll make a shout-out to the bread at mikeno lodge as it was simply to die for. be ready to see abject poverty on your drive from goma to bukima/kibati as this is tough for some people, do know though that these are very capable people able to farm and mix their own concrete, what they really need is stability something your visit can hopefully play a small part in. virunga national park is an extroardinarily well run and non corrupt entity opporating in a place famous for the opposite, i would encourage anyone looking to come to stay abreast of the current situation (elections coming up, if happen as scheduled, in november) and to book. finally on costs, this is not a cheap trip, especially if you're on a starbucks or equivalent paycheque like me. i won't go into details too much as it is all on the virunga website but i spent about 2000cad on the days. do not let that put you off too much as it is truly once in a lifetime. here is a very small sample of the pictures i took for those interested. -&gt;"
ptsd,depression,1209,"my ptsd has been kept in check for a number of years. but, like most people with ptsd with it under control, it *does* crop up from time to time. aaaand, like most people with ptsd with comes with a big, heaping helping of social anxiety. my social anxiety comes with all the [classic last night, i had one of the worst anxiety attacks i have ever experienced. my thanksgiving plan was originally pretty solid. i was flying solo, which didn't bother me. i had planned on cooking dinner for some security guards at a jobsite, then going to a buffet that a five-star hotel was putting on. bring a book, relax, enjoy the excellent fare. braised short ribs, roasted chicken, pan seared trout, prime rib, and of course- turkey. i dropped off the dinner i had cooked for the jobsite to a bunch of very grateful guards, my heart lifted....it went downhill from there. i got to the hotel, which was crammed with people. families, happy couples. then there's lil ole me. i overheard a hostess say, ""wow we are packed, all these people!"" it's an innocuous remark. that's when the intrusive thoughts started. *all of these people here that deserve the food more than you do. it's just you.* *why can't you just take your fat ass home and have some cereal, you selfish bitch?* *you're the reason those facebook memes exist. making people work on thanksgiving. christ you're so selfish.* *everyone here has happy families. and look at you. alone. like always.* i started to hyperventilate and cry. sruining their thanksgiving. *""oh, honey, look at her. she's crying. that poor girl. god, that is so sad. and on thanksgiving, too. why do you think she's crying?""* now they're thinking about me, instead of having a good time with their families. i just want to be invisible. that's all i wanted. the waitress came back with the check. i hastily scribbled a 40% tip with a note that i'm sorry that i ruined thanksgiving for everyone. i power walked out of the hotel, and once i hit the pavement i literally *ran* to my car. i know i must've looked quite the sight. a sobbing woman with her purse, her hair flying, running through the streets of downtown. i got into my car and when i got home, i wailed for hours, on the couch, under the blanket. i tried to overcome it, i really did. i tried to work through it, and i just couldn't. i don't have any emergency meds that i can take to calm me down, like attivan or diazepam. my new insurance has no mental health coverage. the only place in town that will accept a patient with no insurance will see you...for $500 per visit. so. thank you, ptsd. thank you for ruining not only my thanksgiving; but that of others. (you will never convince me i didn't ruin at least the thanksgiving of the woman who tried to comfort me.) ***if*** by some chance, she is reading this...i know what you were trying to do. thank you, and i'm sorry that i ruined your thanksgiving. i have an illness that i sometimes cannot control. thank you, and i'm sorry."

ptsd,depression,1256,"in short, it’s perhaps best described as a sort of full\-body existential agony that totally consumes me directly following and sometimes during sex. a simplified overview of my story, for context: i was raped by my father until i was 6, at which point my mother discovered what was happening and took my sibling and i and fled as far away as she could. at this point he had tried to kill her once before and had promised her that if she ever left he would find us and kill us all, and that’s what he did. he stalked us to the other side of the country, found where we lived, and was partway through breaking down the front door when the police showed up and they got into an armed standoff with him, from which he eventually stood down. he was only sentenced to probation, partially due to a lack of ready evidence to substantiate the allegations of abuse, partially due to having a highly respectable military record, but mostly thanks to his almost superhuman ability to manipulate other people to his will. they sentenced us to have to live with him in the place we had tried to escape to, saying that since my parents were not legally divorced he had a right to live with his children. after this all of the physical, emotional, and sexual abuse escalated, of course, until finally one day he tried to beat my mother to death in front of me and she managed to escape through a window and get to help, at which point she finally had the legal ground to force him out of our lives, and that’s more or less where that story ends. i was seriously fucked up by the time we first ran from him, so my mother sought out specialists right away after we moved. at age six i was clinically diagnosed with complex ptsd and chronic suicidal depression. \(they may not have added suicidal to the descriptor until i was older, but it was already the dominant characteristic of my depression even if it wout only lasts around 15 minutes top, usually. as i experience it, it is distinctly different from a dissociate experience — in fact, it feels almost opposite to it. it is as though my body is going into a kind of shock at re\-experiencing the physical sensations that are inextricably bound to the existential agony i went through as a child when i felt the deaths of my sense of self, of safety, of rational meaning behind the experiencing of life, of trust and hope and everything else that seems to flood me during this experience. the emotional and mental hangover of the experience usually lasts somewhere between 2\-10 hours, depending on intensity, etc. sometimes i start shaking, sometimes i weep uncontrollably, sometimes i cannot speak and just stare in silence for a while. sometimes it turns into a strange kind of bliss where the sickest impulses inside me tell me it’s a direct answer to the question of why killing myself is the one and only option in the end, because it is what i believe to be true in my heart, if i’m honest with myself. fortunately i also know that i cannot trust my own physiology, and if this particular feeling arises i know if i simply observe it without engaging it for a while it will quiet back down again. anyways, the point of all this is that each one of these experiences is a brutal, crushing experience, and if i allow too many to happen in somewhat quick succession i begin to feel diseased by its influence, and i’m very much afraid if i try to push through it that some day it may prove too much and my mind will just unravel completely, or something worse. if anyone here can relate to this, i’d love to know! i’ve never met any doctors, etc that seem experienced with this problem or were really grasping how intense the whole thing is, or how serious of an obstacle its been towards me feeling like i’m a real human being. thanks for reading."

(he's since admitted to being a severe alcoholic and has been clean and in aa for 7 months now) so, now i'm left with just myself and my child. crushing anxiety, and an inability to forge any kind of relationship. terrified of having sex, or really even being touched at this point. any help or suggestions would be amazing. what have you done? is there anyway to get past this? will i be sexless forever? will i ever like it? i feel like a fucking rejected piece of society with my son being the only purpose of my life (which i love every single second of being his mother) i need help. i don't know what to do, i've tried therapy and it hasn't helped in the slightest. i honestly can't even afford it anymore. i'm also hesitant to try medication because i'm still nursing. if you've gotten this far into reading...thank you."

ptsd,depression,1303,"i don’t know if it’s because i was sexually abused as a child and always felt i had to hypersexualize myself or if it’s mainly just because of my enfp personality. probably a both/and type of situation. i know as an enfps, i can be very passionate, childlike, kind and enthusiastic. i was at a support meeting with three men and i became really engaged in the topic. i started making empathic, embodied, and affirming, passionate sounds while saying “yes,” “mmm,” and i also then felt unsafe once i realized the men are interested. i wonder if they thought my passion was flirting? this happens to me a lot where i feel men get the wrong idea and feel like i led them on and they feel rejected/sad/mad when they find out i’m not really interested. then i feel guilty like it is my fault for being sexualized. so then i’ll hide my personality especially feminine traits which is not good to do either. has anyone experienced this as well?"
bipolar,depression,1304,"i’ve been taking latuda for a 3 weeks now. i’ve gotten drunk twice and smoked pot for 2 different days on it. i can say that drugs and alcohol aren’t good on it. i like my life better without those and with latuda. however, i feel that due to this disease i have squandered my youth. i’m now 28. i want to have drive and a passion, but i don’t know how and i feel like it’s too late to make something o lose myself in obsession of trying to make up for the past 15 years of lethargic absence from my life. how do i pursued my goal of making myself into something when i have to defeat these problems?; i feel like a loser sometimes. being bipolar means avoiding all or nothing, so how to pursue it with a level head and consistency that is maintainable. i’ve wasted so much time, is it already too late?"

adhd,depression,1334,"just in case anyone isn't aware of what learned helplessness feels like, and as a warning to people not to keep trying the same thing over and over, i've written the following. i will use the term ""brain"" to refer to the unconscious, impulsive parts of the brain, the parts that aren't ""you"", and ""you"" to refer to your conscious experience and rational brain. (disclaimer, this is only my experience, i don't know what other people's experiences are.) --- imagine walking around, going through life, except you don't decide what you do. your brain decides everything for you and you have no say. it wants to play video games, so you play video games. that isn't to say you don't fight it, but on those occasions that you do you either are simply unable to do anything, or every frustration with yourself for every past failure floods upon you, washing your willpower away in a tidal wave of anxiety. you quickly learn the only way to fight is to not fight at all. --- now, imagine somebody calmly tells you, ""i know it's hard, but you really need to just get up and do it. i have no magic bullet unfortunately."" this is nice, they know that you have a hard time ""just doing it"" but at this point there's no way around it, it just needs to be done. you wholeheartedly agree with them, and feel like the ultimate solution _is_ to ""just do it"". your brain however immediately reminds you how ""it's never worked before, so why will it work now?"" this isn't just a small voice, it is backed by the combined anxiety of every failure and inadequacy you have ever had. --- i'll attempt to explain what lies behind this sense of hopelessness: this sense of hopelessness, in its simplest form, is the feeling that ""it's never worked, so why would it change?"" however, it goes deeper than that. the following is the main thought process: - according to other people you just need to try hard enough to solve the problem - you feel like you have tried counn't care anymore"" ( ditto ) - ""i hate myself"" (when i metaphorically close my eyes, cover my ears, and run from what i need to do yelling ""lalalalalalalala"", also when i am sitting doing something i enjoy and remember what i'm supposed to be doing) - ""i just can't."" (when i try to calm myself or when i'm lying in a fetal position on the bed, spiraling deeper into depression) - ""i just want the world to go away"" (this feeling makes me realize why some people kill themselves. i fortunately just retreat to my bed or some form of entertainment that allows my brain to shut off temporarily) --- i'm not saying this is permanent problem, or that there aren't any solutions, just that it's incredibly difficult, more difficult than i feel most anyone can imagine. it's the torture of hopelessness, with the frustration of fully knowing with your rational brain that hope itself is all that is needed to solve the problem, yet finding that hope hopelessly far away. please, everyone. think before you tell someone to ""just try."" they may have forgotten how to. --- edit: some people may say that you just need to build in systems, and i agree that that is a good solution, but at least for me, i've tried so many of my own systems that even trying to talk with it causes my brain to lock up with anxiety. likely because it forces me to confront all my past failures, which further discourages me from trying. i'd still love to hear any advice people have though. --- tl;dr; learned helplessness isn't thinking you are helpless, it is feeling that you've forgotten how to try. if you really wanted to try it would have worked, since people say to just try, so you must not really _want_ to try, so you begin to instead want to want to try. in addition, confronting it in any way brings with it all the anxiety of every past failure, meaning that often, instead of doing something you often fail to do you just close your eyes and hope it'll go away."

adhd,depression,1352,"feel free to just ignore this, i'm just posting it here so i can move on with my life. i hope everyone has a good day! - what i wrote: i'm probably going to regret responding to this, but here goes: adhd is not just being very active, it is not just having difficulty focusing at school. it is a complex disorder, primarily genetic in origin, which leads to certain critical areas of the brain failing to develop properly. actually, at least a few experts in the field have said it's probably more accurate to refer to it as a spectrum of disorders similar to autism. unfortunately there isn't yet a clear enough understanding of all the mechanisms interacting in the brain to derive a truly accurate division of the different aspects of this spectrum. research is continuing. now, not fully understanding the mechanisms behind it doesn't mean we can't see the results. for more than half a century medical researchers have studied people with the symptoms of adhd, and there are some statistics which come through clearly, people with untreated adhd are far more likely than average to: - die young - experience traumatic injuries - cause traffic (and other) accidents - become addicted to drugs - fail to develop meaningful relationships, and lose the relationships they do manage to stare can do with one's life), the time i almost shot myself, and the many many times i wanted to end my life in other ways. the countless nights i spent crying, screaming into my pillow, begging my thoughts to stop *just for a minute so i could finally fall asleep*. the intense - sometimes unbearable - discomfort of being forced to sit still, i would (still do sometimes) bite my knuckles until i almost broke the skin or stab myself with a pen or pin because *the pain was better than the discomfort of sitting still*. the ridiculously stupid thoughtless things i have said again, and again, *and again* despite knowing as soon as the words left my mouth that i shouldn't have said them, didn't really mean them, and would regret them. all the different ways i screwed up, over and over, trying with all of my strength and all of my will not to do it again *but knowing that i would no matter how hard i tried*. this is adhd. rather, this is a small part of adhd. i literally can't tell you everything, and i've already written enough. more than enough. i hope you have a great day, and i hope that if you ever find yourself in charge of a child who is suffering, truly suffering, you won't deny them the chance to *try* a treatment which may help them. peace. edit: tried to fix the layout"

ptsd,depression,1358,"the national post on march 4, 2018 stated that “there is a fashion among veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder for having therapy dogs accompany them in public places. mind you, we are not supposed to call them “therapy dogs”. that is an insulting term, one that hints that these animals are not as serious, and might not be eligible for the same legal and social deference, as trained dogs for the blind, physically disabled, or cognitively compromised.” &amp;nbsp; they didn’t stop there, calling a ptsd service dog a fashion accessory wasn’t enough for them they went further to claim that there is no scientific evidence to back up these “therapeutic dogs”, they even ridiculed a hero amongst canadian veterans, medric cousineau, who has tirelessly championed service dogs for vets with ptsd and found brian’s, sasha. &amp;nbsp; as most of you know brian’s dog sasha is the reason he was able to function in the world again after returning home from his last tour to the sandbox (afghanistan). at the time he was on a shocking regimen of drugs: psychotropics, sleeping pills, ssri’s, pain meds… you name it he rattled with it. he couldn’t function. he was isolated and in pain both physical and mental. it was medric cousineau who found his cure, a dog called sasha. with her by his side he was able to re-enter the world and somewhat bit by bit function again. &amp;nbsp; the first time brian took sasha out though was excruciating. here was a visible symbol of his invisible injury. it says, “there is something wrong with me”. i have been horrified by the obnoxious comments that often come his way, the ignorance around ptsd service dogs that remains out there. the first time he was turned away from a restaurant, hurt and humiliated him. he is in the middle of a human rights fight with a taxi firm in ottawa who refused to take him because he had sasha with him when he was on the way to the government’s mental health committee for veterans. &amp;nbsp; you can perhaps imagine my deep and seething rage upon reading this appalling post from what i had thought was a reputable media outlet, the national post. so, i did as general hines did, and many others, we approached the editor and ask that they apologize and post a rebuttal. they steadfastly refused stating that they fully endorse the article, the comments made in it and the writer, colby cosh. &amp;nbsp; in my emails back and forth with the editor i pointed out the danger of increasing the stigma around serws for studying pscyhiatric and neurological injuries. pleaes read it to glean more on this subject. &amp;nbsp; horowitz 2008 measured the increases in oxytocin and dopamine, reduction of cortisol in individuals interacting with their service dogs. &amp;nbsp; physiological stress reduction responses were measured and colated by yount, olmert &amp; lee in 2012. &amp;nbsp; the pathway to the brain that (is believed) to be affected by ptsd is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis; oxytocin has been shown to decrease cytokines, adrenaocorticotrophic hormone and coritsol which are the active ingredients in the hpa. service dogs have been proved to increase the natural production of oxytocin. &amp;nbsp; psychological (proven) impact of service dogs for survivors of ptsd. &amp;nbsp; valsecchi, paerto-previde, accorsi &amp; fallani 2010 amongst others cited above studied in depth the “secure base effect” of a service dog. also, the impact on “attachment”. now i understand that your grasp of the principles of human psychology are sketchy at best so i will do my darndest to simplify this for you. &amp;nbsp; “any relationship in which proximity to the other affects security is an attachment relationship” escolas &amp; friends in 2012 (fyi this is 2018 but hey i’m sure google was down the day you wrote this.) &amp;nbsp; attachment and a secure base are the two things a ptsd survivor does not have. fixing that is key in their recovery. it allows survivors to reconnect with family and the world at large. &amp;nbsp; social level: sachs-ericsson &amp; mates all the way back in 2002, go figure, found that individuals with service dogs were less isolated socially and felt more comfortable when initiating social interactions with others, also increased a survivors social desirability (note also that henry &amp; crowley 2011 found that a survivors sense of self-worth as well as murturance were enhanced exponentially by having a service dog). do i need to add the impact of these on a survivor of ptsd’s ability to recover? &amp;nbsp; **treatment effects of a service dog on a ptsd survivor** **86% of individuals in esnayra &amp; love 2005 study of those with agoraphobia and anxiety reported a reduction with a service dog. 86%. but that’s nothing right? still a fashion accessory.** **80% respodents diagnosed with ptsd, pani and depression reported a decrease in the mh symptoms they experienced.** **40% were able to reduce the medications they were prescribed.**"

adhd,depression,1370,"just a quick tip. if the current you had no 'willpower', future you can't be expected to either. thats fine though, willpower isn't neccesary. to achieve your goals, forming systems of accountability and support structures is the easiest way. this means organising study groups, emailing your lecturers, telling your classmate you are going to send him the work you've done so far at a given time. if you can't watch a 2 hour of lecture today, how do you think you are going to watch 20 hours of lectures on top of all your other commitments next week? i don't know about you, but i've often thought ""i would happily give away my entire weekend if it meant i had done 10 hours of study"", even though that means i'm forgoing 15-18 hours of sleep and 12-15 hours of leisure, assuming i could make myself do 10 hours of study normally. however, it would be worth it. 100% worth it, if you are unable to study normally like me. because 10s might all seem excessive, but also realise that normal people don't have to rely on willpower as much as we do. in addition to out brain chemisty, another the reason why we with adhd struggle so much is because getting judged is so painful for us, so we subconsciously try to escape from and avoid systems of accountability. so we end up not only trying to manage a brain that struggles to plan, organise and focus, but we are also lacking the support networks that could help compensate for this, that others have but take for granted. eventually, once we have developed routine, structure, and good habits, you can relax those systems of accountability, but don't completely toss them aside so, right now, i recommend you try to build your system of accountability, whether with family, friends, teaching staff, or even people here on reddit, because its by taking willpower out of the equation that you are most likely to succeed."

adhd,depression,1372,"it annoys me when people say that adhd just makes you hyper. for example, take freshman year me: i just enrolled into high school, starry eyed just like the rest of the kids looking to make friends, get into college, and find some passions. however, the honeymoon phase quickly ran its course, replaced by the constant stress of grades and most importantly, making friends. for me, i was basically friendless for my first two years; i never even hung out with one person. now, as a college freshman armed with more knowledge about our condition, i decided to make a small tidbit on what adhd can affect in your social life, and how to overcome it. first of all, we need to deal with out physical and (most importantly) mental hyperactivity. physically, hyperactivity can sometimes be a pain, but i found that the mental aspect was much more damaging to my social life. not being able to listen, talking too much, and not being able to self regulate are the three main problems that plagued my life. also, it’s important to realize that i was never physicory, making a 10 second example turn into a 5 minute epilogue. to be honest, the hardest part about add/adhd for me was not having the ability to make friends as well as others. this is usually overlooked by online articles, but plays a much more damaging role in our personal lives. i know that there are thousands of kids just like me, too hyper to be accepted into the normality of society, but fortunately, this can be fixed. by combining the use of a vigorous monitoring system and empathetic self reflections, i hope that kids will be able to not repeat the same mistakes i did and live more emotionally balanced lives, filled with plenty of friends. end note: this is just my ramblings after i took the wrong meds before going to sleep. this definitely isn’t the shining example of a good essay, but the overall message is to find kids that are going through the same predicament, and help them. if you’re struggling with social isolation/ alienation, i would love to hear your story. at the end of the day, we all need a friend to talk too, right?"

anxiety,depression,1392,"so if you’re reading this and currently in the midst of an anxiety disorder, let me start by saying i know how you feel. i’ve had panic attacks where the adrenaline rushes just don’t stop, i’ve been nauseated and unable to eat or drink for days on end, i’ve felt so short of breath it was like drowning above water, had the jitters and the lump in my throat. i’ve also had all of the uncomfortable mental symptoms. i’ve dissociated for almost a full day multiple times, i’ve had racing, intrusive thoughts that lasted weeks and sometimes months at a time. and i’ve felt like i was going crazy. a lot. but i’m here to tell you my struggle with my anxiety disorder is over. after almost a year of conscious and concerted effort, all of the worst symptoms of my anxiety are completely gone. some of the more mild ones still appear from time to time; i’ll get fatigued or dizzy/foggy maybe once every few weeks, but this happens so infrequently (and becomes less frequent with each occurrence) that it doesn’t really bug me. i was also on medication (an ssri since day one and a benzo for the first few months) and am in the process of tapering off . so i wanted to write a post about how to get over each stage of your anxiety, mainly because i know i really would have appreciated this kind of guidance when i first sought help in late april of last year. if you want a summary of things you can do regardless of what stage you’re at, scroll to the bottom and check the paragraph in bold. i don’t discuss responses to specific symptoms here, just a general approach. if you’re looking for tactics for specific symptoms, check out the list of books i left in the second section. i think the first one does a particularly good job of addressing every symptom, but you can try the third if you don’t feel it makes enough of a difference. before you read, i want to mention something once so i don’t have to later on. recovery is going to be like a rollercoaster. some days you’ll feel like you made incredible progress, and others you’ll have difficulty even doing simple tasks. it’s going to be a lot of two steps forward, one step back. sometimes it’ll even be two steps forward, two steps back. but even those times are okay, because they serve as proof that you are capable of improving. just know that once you start to give effort, things will start gradually getting better. so here it is. my comprehensive guide to recovering from an anxiety disorder. if you’re at a constant 9/10 - 10/10 anxiety and can’t calm down: at this stage, you’re either in the middle of panic attack (which lasts up to 60 minutes) or you have gad and are constantly anxious. i was diagnosed with gad and pure-o but i’ve had maaaaaany panic attacks, so i know this advice will work for both. **1.** stop trying to fight your anxiety symptoms. understand that the best thing you can do for your body right now is just let it run its course. this is the basis of acceptance and commitment therapy (act) which is one of the types of therapy currently used to treat anxiety disorders. to do this: * don’t try to stop any symptoms you are experiencing. this is infinitely easier said than done at first, but with practice you’ll be able to pick this up fairly quickly. when i was first having constant adrenaline rushes, i kept trying to consciously stop them. this was actually making things worse. the more you try to fight your symptoms, the more worried you become, which in turn causes your system to release more of the stress-causing hormones, causing your symptoms to become worse. the best thing you can do at this point is wait it out and let your body tire itself out. * questions, doubts, and fear will come up. when they do, remind yourself that this is a totally normal process that your body is going through, and try to rest in the anxiety. it may be difficult, but try to ease into the symptoms. this was initially what helped my adrenaline rushes decrease in severity and frequency. * if this isn’t working and you find your symptoms are still persisting and won’t stop, ask for more. as the dare response (discussed later) puts it, run towards your symptoms. if you’ve ever read a book on act, this step is likely in there. when you ask your body to make your symptoms worse, you’ll find it can’t. the symptoms of anxiety are driven by a subconscious worry, and not something you can control. keep running towards it until your symptoms gradually begin to ease, then move on to step 2. in case you’re interested, the clinical term for this is “arousal reappraisal.” it’s not discussed very often, but i found it to be very helpful. **2.** do anything you possibly can to get your mind off of the anxiety. in older forms of anxiety treatment, this kind of thing was referred to as a distraction tactic, but in the dare response, barry mcdonagh calls it being “engaged.” this basically means do whatever you can to focus your mind on something other than your anxiety. regardless of what level of anxiety you’re at, this is incredibly important. **your anxiety is most easily fueled when you focus on it, so do whatever you can to move your attention to something else.** again, much easier said than done, and your mind will fight you at every stage. but it’s an integral part of recovery. when i first started out, i found short activities the most helpful, like picking up my guitar/cajon and playing a song or two, or doing homework. **3.** give it time. your system can’t sustain anxiety levels this high for an extended period of time unless you consciously fuel it. if you are properly easing into your symptoms and engaging yourself in other activities you’ll eventually calm down to the next phase of anxiety recovery. **4.** if recommended by your physician, a benzo might help. benzos are basically nervous system relaxants, but they’re no magic pill. when i took my first dose of valium, i didn’t feel a thing. it took a few days of constant dosing to see any effect. benzos are fine to use in the very beginning, but i will issue a warning about them: try to use them as sparingly as possible. benzos are not meant to be used in the long term, and if the first thing you do when feeling anxious is reach for your benzo, you’ll have real difficulty recovering in the later stages. but since at this point, you’re in a constant state of panic, they’re a great way to ease you down to the next lowest stage of anxiety, so you can start focusing on the long term. **5.** journal. i don’t recommend this as much beyond this stage, as i’ve found it doesn’t really help all that much. but in the beginning stages of my experience with gad, i found journaling to be an indispensable asset to really figure out what i was going through. just write out whatever you’re thinking or feeling. it’s a great what to get out of your head for at least a little bit. **6.** get up and do something to release all your pent up adrenaline. walk around the block, take a stretch break at work. you don’t need to be doing a full workout at this point, just something to help you use the jitters and adrenaline you’re getting for something productive. **7.** this one may seem rather minor, but it helped me a lot in the beginning: fix your posture. it’s much easier to feel short of breath when you’re in a position that doesn’t let you breath easily. if you’re lying down, lay on your back. if you’re sitting, sit up straight. once you’ve thoroughly calmed down from this point (this took me about three or four weeks), you can move on to the next step. constant 6 - 8/10 with occasional panic attacks: if you’re at this phase, you are probably still experiencing physical manifestations of your anxiety, like jitters, nausea, jelly legs, shortness of breath, and so on. but you’re not in constant freakout mode anymore. you can make logical decisions aimed more at long term recovery because rather than being focused on your anxiety 100% of the time, you pay attention to it 80 - 90% of the time. you may be leaving the house occasionally but your symptoms are still bad enough that they keep you at home most of the time. so here’s what to do at this stage: **1. start reading or listening to books on what you’re going through**. the more you understand the subtleties of what’s going on in your brain and body, the better you’ll be able fix them. read up on therapy techniques as they’ll be your quickest route to recovery. in the end, this ended up being the single most helpful thing for my recovery. when you’re knowledgeable of exactly what is at your disposal, you can try everything and see what works best for you. in fact, i found really helpful ideas in books that none of my therapists had even heard of. like your anxiety, the list of books that will be the most helpful for you is very personalized, but here are my recommendations (all of these books are available on audible, which is how i consumed them): * the dare response. phenomenal book written by someone who’s been through the worst parts of anxiety and paved his own path to recovery. his techni person must think i’m a loser.” in this case, whether or not the situation was awkward, you don’t know what the other person is thinking. i used to think this a lot until i realized people really didn’t see me that way, and all the worrying i did was for nothing. a healthy level of questioning can do lots to help you overcome your anxiety. at this stage, i had the most trouble with mental symptoms, namely the feeling of going crazy. i thought the little floaters in my eyes were hallucinations, i always second guessed my own sanity, i thought the weird dreams or intrusive thoughts i was having were a sign of schizophrenia, and anytime i was happy, i thought it was a sign of bipolar disorder. this is another great example of cognitive fusion that took me a while to get over: i thought i was going crazy, so to me that was evidence that i really was. if you think this describes you, it might do you well to get into the habit of questioning your thoughts as well. is it more logical that your psychiatrist, therapists, family, and friends are correct when they say you’re not crazy and are just experiencing symptoms of anxiety, or that you’re the one person out of the fifty who’s somehow figured out you’re losing it? this applies to basically every anxious situation you may encounter. remember: **just because you think something doesn’t make it true**. one of the things that took me a long time to realize was that my constant worry over these things was caused by the fact that i was paying so much attention to them. at this point in recovery, it’s absolutely **imperative that you keep yourself occupied, especially when you’re most anxious**. i found that doing things like cooking and cleaning were ways to keep my mind off my anxiety without having to think about it. i suggest doing the same, as they’re both productive and beneficial in the end. eventually, your mind will calm down on its own and you’ll find your own solutions to these symptoms. i find that at this point the really important thing really is time. once i felt like i was going crazy for the hundredth time, i realized that if every time before this one was a false alarm, this one (and all the ones after for that matter) are false alarms too. this stage took about 3 months to recover from, but once i did, i hit the next stage. anxiety is 1 - 3 most days, with some days feeling almost completely anxiety free: you’re in the home stretch. this is it. you’re likely already giving yourself credit for all the hard work you’ve done, but you should still take a moment to recognize just how far you’ve come. for me, having a day where i go out and try something new with friends while anxious is something i wouldn't have been able to do even before my anxiety disorder. certainly not anything i’d ever dreamed of while in the thick of it. seriously, if you’ve hit this point, the light should be at the end of the tunnel. and on the days where it’s a little harder to deal with, let me reassure you: you’re almost home free. note: your symptoms will still be present at this point. some of the intrusive thoughts might still come, sometimes you’ll have a bit of dissociation or an occasional almost-panic attack, but you know how to deal with these things. your moments of panic don’t last more than a few seconds, and your symptoms don’t really illicit a response from you. at this stage: **1.** you know what works best for you. keep doing it. you have your techniques and you’ve clearly demonstrated they work. all that’s left is to keep doing them and reap the rewards you know will come. on the worse days when your anxiety peaks at a 3 or 4, remind yourself where you were several months ago and how you’ll never experience anxiety that bad ever again. then gently engage yourself in something and ride the wave of anxiety until it subsides. **2.** slowly lose your crutches. if you discuss your anxiety with your friends, stop doing so as frequently and eventually stop altogether. if you’re still occasionally taking benzos, slowly taper off. the more of your independence you get back, the more confident you’ll feel. **3.** keep exploring other areas of your life where you’ve had anxiety and use what you’ve learned to stop worrying. for me, this meant things like conquering my fear of heights by going snowboarding, and confronting my discomfort with physical and emotional intimacy by going out of my way to discuss these things. the more of these long-standing anxieties you’re able to ease, the better you’ll feel overall. plus you get the added sense of achievement for doing things that past you would’ve never been able to do. there really isn’t much left to say at this stage. i found myself being discouraged more frequently at this point just because i knew i was so close to the finish line but not quite there. in case you need any encouragement, remind yourself of how well you’ve done so far and that there’s more to come. then finally… no anxiety, with the worst days peaking at a 0.5 or 1: that’s it. all the voices in your head telling you you’re not good enough have gone silent. all those symptoms you used to worry so much about don’t really happen anymore. you might still be a bit fatigued or foggy some days, but most of the time you’re energetic, present, and can confront new challenges with a sense of confidence you’ve never had. it’s been a few months since you’ve even given your anxiety a second thought. you know some of your symptoms might come back for a short spell every once in a while, but you’re not worried about them. you know exactly what to do when that happens, and that they’ll go away just as quickly as they came. i don’t have any advice for this point. you know what got you here and have built up the mental fortitude to know you’ll keep on doing it. congratulations. you understand how amazing it is that you got to this point. remember this feeling. _ my therapist once gave me a great rule of thumb i think sums things up really well: whatever your anxiety is telling you to do, do the opposite. if it’s telling you not to get out of bed, do it. if it’s telling you not to go to a social event, do that. if it’s telling you you’re going to suffer from some grave illness, remind yourself that’s not true. if it’s telling you to google your symptoms or ask for help, don’t. if it’s telling you you’re losing your mind, remind yourself you’re not. give it enough time, and eventually things will get better. **summary:** **ease into your symptoms. remember that it’s just anxiety and can’t do anything other than make you uncomfortable. you’ve been through this a hundred times before and survived every single time.** **don’t fight it. when you fight your anxiety, it only gets worse. so let your anxiety do whatever it wants and just watch as a detached observer.** **keep yourself occupied. the more time you spend thinking about your anxiety, googling your symptoms, posting on this subreddit, writing in your journal, or just stewing in general, the worse off you’ll be. cook, clean, dance, exercise, paint, draw, do anything you can to forcibly rip your mind off your anxiety.** **keep pushing the bounds of what you’re doing. expose yourself to more anxiety. exercise harder. try things you’ve never tried before. make your anxiety flare up as much as possible because you know it’ll only benefit you in the end.** **regularly question your thoughts. just because you think something doesn’t make it true. you’ll find a hundred times out of a hundred the thing you’ve been dreading isn’t half as horrible as your brain has made it out to be.** **give it time. you’ll find once you experience the same anxiety for the same reason for the thousandth time in a row that it becomes a bit easier to stop believing what it tells you.** thank you for reading this. i really hope that, no matter where you’re at in life, you gained something from this. please let me know what parts of this were the most helpful, or if there’s

you absolutely will make it through and that you'll be a much better person for it. keep in mind: anxiety does not define you. an anxiety disorder is not a permanent condition. much like any other illness or disorder, you can take gradual steps to recover. it may not come as quickly as you want and you will encounter plenty of pitfalls. but once you start counting your victories, however small, you'll realize what a **huge** difference your efforts can make. good luck guys :)"

bipolar,depression,1400,"so, as we all know, many managers are very unforgiving and aren't very keen on helping you out when you're not doing well. most of my past managers have treated me poorly, and when i tell them of my bipolar, they scheduled me less or looked at me differently, in a bad way. my current job as a manager, i cannot allow any of my emotions to clog me. and i'm quite good at it, especially since i've been put on medications that have made me so stable i often forget to worry about mood swings. but, a while ago, i was sexually assaulted and it comes and goes in waves all the ptsd stuff. but i deal and move on. a few days ago i had a completely meltdown at work and i couldn't shake it off. i went to the back and cr had blown up and i was angry and upset. i told him i would need a few days in november for court and he gave a look that wasn't the standard ""i'm so sorry"" look but the ""i'm surprised i didn't know"" look. and where i was going the entire time was, he told me if i ever needed pto that i could tell him. i didn't need to tell him what the court was about, but he told me that if i needed time, let him know. this guy i've fought with since day 1 understood my situation with clarity and empathy and told me to tell him if i needed pto. i didn't think that would ever happen, but it did. i appreciate him so much more than i did before. i love being validated and understood by someone who has never experienced this."

adhd,depression,1487,"been having a terribly hard time with this math class and on my last module for the semester and i have 2 weeks to complete it. i sat down yesterday and grinded my pen against my notebook studying retaking the pretest over and over i think i have 25 attempts down right now, making sure i understood the problems and formulas. took both of my adderall yesterday and put 1 song on repeat for 2 hours then some other albums to keep mdd. i just thought i would share a bit of success on my end and hopefully give a bit of hope to others here. i know the struggle of getting sucked into distraction and not wanting to do homework or anything mentally taxing. even though it required a ton of discipline, i got it to work. i hope you guys have a good week, we all deserve what we want, even if it does require us to work a bit harder than others. you guys are awesome!"
