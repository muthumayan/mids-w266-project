none,bipolar,4,"hey guys, so i had a little check up in class in which i got 7/10 points. i wanted to ask if the 3 points i wasn't given are justified. 1. we should translate the german equivalent for ""when someone is sick and he makes the transition from being into working life to being on sick leave"" into english. i wrote ""to go into sick leave"". hkes enough money to live, from doing something"" i wrote: ""make a living out of something"". when i asked my teacher about it she just gave me a weird look and told me that i had apparently used the wrong preposition, she said it's to be ""make a living from something"". i am convinced that both are possible. tell me reddit, what's right?"
depression,bipolar,5,"i am a horrible friend. i have a lot of trouble controlling my mood and when things are bad i'm cranky. i get mad over trivial things because....idk...maybe it's easier to be like that then admit how much everything hurts for no fucking reason. i also vary between very needy and extremely avoidant. i'm super flaky with plans, but i get really upset when other people are like me. i fucking hate myself. no wonder i'm lonely. no one should have to deal with me."
adhd,anxiety,7,"just in case anyone isn't aware of what learned helplessness feels like, and as a warning to people not to keep trying the same thing over and over, i've written the following. i will use the term ""brain"" to refer to the unconscious, impulsive parts of the brain, the parts that aren't ""you"", and ""you"" to refer to your conscious experience and rational brain. (disclaimer, this is only my experience, i don't know what other people's experiences are.) --- imagine walking around, going through life, except you don't decide what you do. your brain decides everything for you and you have no say. it wants to play video games, so you play video games. that isn't to say you don't fight it, but on those occasions that you do you either are simply unable to do anything, or every frustration with yourself for every past failure floods upon you, washing your willpower away in a tidal wave of anxiety. you quickly learn the only way to fight is to not fight at all. --- now, imagine somebody calmly tells you, ""i know it's hard, but you really need to just get up and do it. i have no magic bullet unfortunately."" this is nice, they know that you have a hard time ""just doing it"" but at this point there's no way around it, it just needs to be done. you wholeheartedly agree with them, and feel like the ultimate solution _is_ to ""just do it"". your brain however immediately reminds you how ""it's never worked before, so why will it work now?"" this isn't just a small voice, it is backed by the combined anxiety of every failure and inadequacy you have ever had. --- i'll attempt to explain what lies behind this sense of hopelessness: this sense of hopelessness, in its simplest form, is the feeling that ""it's never worked, so why would it change?"" however, it goes deeper than that. the following is the main thought process: - according to other people you just need to try hard enough to solve the problem - you feel like you have tried counn't care anymore"" ( ditto ) - ""i hate myself"" (when i metaphorically close my eyes, cover my ears, and run from what i need to do yelling ""lalalalalalalala"", also when i am sitting doing something i enjoy and remember what i'm supposed to be doing) - ""i just can't."" (when i try to calm myself or when i'm lying in a fetal position on the bed, spiraling deeper into depression) - ""i just want the world to go away"" (this feeling makes me realize why some people kill themselves. i fortunately just retreat to my bed or some form of entertainment that allows my brain to shut off temporarily) --- i'm not saying this is permanent problem, or that there aren't any solutions, just that it's incredibly difficult, more difficult than i feel most anyone can imagine. it's the torture of hopelessness, with the frustration of fully knowing with your rational brain that hope itself is all that is needed to solve the problem, yet finding that hope hopelessly far away. please, everyone. think before you tell someone to ""just try."" they may have forgotten how to. --- edit: some people may say that you just need to build in systems, and i agree that that is a good solution, but at least for me, i've tried so many of my own systems that even trying to talk with it causes my brain to lock up with anxiety. likely because it forces me to confront all my past failures, which further discourages me from trying. i'd still love to hear any advice people have though. --- tl;dr; learned helplessness isn't thinking you are helpless, it is feeling that you've forgotten how to try. if you really wanted to try it would have worked, since people say to just try, so you must not really _want_ to try, so you begin to instead want to want to try. in addition, confronting it in any way brings with it all the anxiety of every past failure, meaning that often, instead of doing something you often fail to do you just close your eyes and hope it'll go away."
ptsd,bipolar,11,"so long story short, recently i’ve been noticing i have more stomach troubles. vomiting, diarrhea, etc. yesterday i had another “stomach bug” but i noticed as soon as i was home it started to go away. it started after this guy was too close to me and was being generally creepy. i almost shit myself in a mcdonald’s and threw up as well on my way home. the last time this happened, a man had gotten too close to me and i almost threw up in my car on the way home. does anyone else experience this? is this something i should tell my psychiatrist?"
bipolar,anxiety,17,"ugh, i hate how this time of year means increased social pressure. i hardly have the energy to socialize to begin with, but add all this holiday stuff on top and it wears me the hell out. went to a christmas tree decorating party this afternoon and after an hour i started fantasizing about announcing ""i have a mental illness so parties are very draining to me ... so ... yeah ... thanks so much, but i have to go now."" i did manage to last a couple more hours but now i'm soooo tired. thank heavens my husband understands."
depression,bipolar,26,i just don't get it. i've been depressed for so many years that i've completely forgotten what it's like to live normally. i can't fathom that there are mentally stable people who live most of their lives as mentally healthy people. i just can't understand it and i hate them.
bipolar,depression,29,"i was just thinking today as i work on a painting and deal with soul sucking depression that i am extremely talented. i’ve gotten full ride scholarships for art school, i have won state awards, i don’t think i’ve ever not gotten into a juried show, i rule. i know how easy it is to get caught up in your negative qualities (especially with mental illness) but what are your strengths?"
bipolar,anxiety,31,"i've been feeling needy and ignored lately, the thing is i'm not interacting with anyone really outside my so. it's too much to handle right now. and my so gives me cuddles and is being helpful. there is really no one to ignore me, you know? but i just feel bad for some reason. i can't figure it out. i'm even upset when people don't reply or upvote my posts and that is really weird because i don't usually notice votes. i ruminate over whether i said the wrong thing or upset someone. i don't always reply to people i've gone into crisis i managed. i dunno, i felt a little weird after a session a few weeks ago. kinda like emdr weird and the session was kinda an unconscious exploring one, not emdr but a different therapy. i keep going back to that. i am left with just vague feelings i don't understand and just feeling uneasy. this is really bugging me. i keep expecting it to resolve, but when i'm resting or taking a time out to recharge it's really on my mind. and i feel unusually sensitive of late,since that weird appointment."
adhd,anxiety,33,"so, you've spent a while working hard at school/life/career/relationships. things have been going well, and all of a sudden some much needed time off comes along. you've got half the week off, and the other half is pretty light in comparison, so it's the fucking best. you can slack off a little bit, and let your mind wander, and there's no ill effects, because everyone does iticult. you got this. slowly scale back your bed time and get a little more rest each night. try to set some reasonable alarms for yourself this weekend, so you keep up the pattern of waking up before noon, and try to make a short to do list to be able to check off some accomplishments. remember, forgive yourself, and don't let any stumbles make you feel like everything is lost."
bipolar,adhd,36,a little while ago i made a post where i was wondering whether my adhd-like symptoms where caused by bipolar or if i actually have adhd. well i just got back from seeing my old therapist and she says she's 99% sure i have adhd inattentive. she told me to absolutely mention it to my pdoc at my appointment in august. i'm so happy to hear from someone certified that i'm not incompetent. hopefully i can make progress from here. i'm glad for some of the motivation you guys gave me in my original posts. thanks for reading
adhd,anxiety,42,"i find myself going silently insane whenever people are talking to me for any length longer than 10 seconds, even friends/loved ones. it feels like an eternity listening to them ramble on even if they were only speaking for a minute. i get fixated on the sound of peoples lips moving and it feels like there are bugs crawling inside my body and it makes me want to scream. my gf has told me she always feels like i'm just waiting for her to stop talking, and i hate myself for doing this to her. even though i am listening to every word she says, it feels like i'm being crushed under a wall of words. has anyone else had this problem? or found any solutions to help it? edit: i'm perscribed vyvanse 50 mg/daily"
depression,anxiety,44,i am from britain. my mum left when i was a baby. at school everyone bullies me because i live in a druggie neighborhood and i don't eat breakfast or lunch and my school uniform is too small that my pants are splitting and i found holes in my shoes . everyone thinks it's even funnier when i'm tripped up on my face and then call me a tosser. they bully me because my dad can't afford internet or school trips or breakfast . i know i shouldn't be posting here or even on here but i'm just in need of a friend to talk to. i am at school for like 15 more minutes which is how i am posting this. please be my friend i will go to the library later if i can if anyone is willing to talk to me .
anxiety,adhd,48,"i am just posting this to ease the minds of people who have gad who sometimes wonder whether it is ""real"" as a disability or not or whether we are making it up, its in our heads, etc.. i came across the stat as i was writing a formal letter requesting an extension on a deadline for my section 8 voucher because of my gad. i was googling whether it was considered a disability or not (i already knew it was...), and i came across that stat which exemplifies how disabling it can be."
depression,anxiety,55,"i wish i could just cease to exist. not to die, but to never even exist. never been born. everyday it gets harder and harder to get up and go about my day. i feel like a fuck up and a disappointment to my family. no matter how hard i try and get my shit together something pops up and it gets worse. the stress, the anxiety, the thoughts. they eat away at me and the longer it goes on the more i want to disappear. i don’t even know why i’m posting this here. i just needed to write it out somewhere. god even on here i want to say sorry to you guys. everything i always end up saying to people. i’m sorry for being a bother. i’m sorry for you having to waste your time pretending to care about me."
anxiety,ptsd,57,"i took the first step. i’ve been struggling so much for the past few months. it’s gotten to the point that i’m barely sleeping and when i do, i have insane nightmares. a couple weeks ago i booked a therapy appointment and it was today. i stood outside the building and came very close to just leaving because the idea of opening up about what i’m strug; if you’re wondering if you should start looking for a therapist, do it. if you’ve found a therapist that seems interesting but you’re not sure if you should reach out, do it. if you’ve made an appointment but you’re not sure if you should attend, attend it. and if you’re standing outside wondering if you should go in, go in. it will help, i promise."
none,anxiety,61,"basically i commented on something in a group chat and a girl replied “mood”. now i know that means “i feel the same”, i’m just wondering if i need to reply to that somehow? if i don’t say anything would it be awkward?"
bipolar,adhd,65,i’m singing everything and forcing myself to not sing on my conference calls. at least this is a feel good one! i almost want to decorate for christmas while i should be working but i know i have stuff i need to do.
adhd,none,67,"i picked up this new book called the subtle art of not giving a f*** from one of my favorite writers, mark manson and i've found it incredibly useful for dealing with both my day to day and future goals. one of my favorite quotes from the book is this: *“the desire forsing your fucks on that. anyway, if the above quotes sparked your interest i highly recommend purchasing the book. there are many fantastic subtleties to the topic that i couldn't possibly put down into a short post and mark manson is a great. peace and have a good day."
adhd,anxiety,68,"video games, weed, watching porn, eating fatty foods, drinking, etc. these are all things i find very hard to control. when i smoke a bit of weed i crave more instantly and i don't stop smoking until i'm baked out of my mind. whenever i'm feeling bad i start overeating, which leads to me feeling worse, which leads to more overeating. whenever i feel bored (which is quite often) i play video games. this leads to me using only video games for pleasure and to esccult emotions, and i dull myself with unhealthy behaviours, instead of just accepting the emotions and processing them in a healthy way. when i stop using these behaviours the negative thoughts and emotions start hitting me very hard. but probably that's just a phase you have to go through, to get out better on the otherside. are there others who struggle with balancing life like me? if you've found a solution, please elaborate. is this just a discipline thing?"
depression,adhd,73,"it took massive amounts of energy, but somehow i accomplished something today. i woke up just in time before the garbage pickup came. it's so hard just to stay afloat and not stay in bed so these little victories have to count for something. it seems like forcing myself to do everything in the morning will lead to more productivity, it's tough. i remember when i had the energy to do all these things without even thinking twice."
bipolar,adhd,77,"not sure if this is normal to bp1, but i'm bad at remembering stuff lately and lose track of time easily. dementia is a trait in my family but i am scared it's just gonna get worse with age. i'm almost 25 and i have to write stuff down or put on my phone stuff all the time or i forget. my bf remembers details from our early dates that i have to be reminded of. it's not cute and i'm worried."
ptsd,anxiety,83,"i feel completely trapped in my own head. i've had that ""chair is about to fall backward"" feeling day in and day out for like three weeks now. it's becoming exhausting. i feel like a thousand screaming emotions are trapped behind a stone exterior. i can't cry or yell or write. i can't express any emotions, even for moms most of the time, it's just particularly bad right now and trying to out-logic my emotions is just overwhelming sometimes. right now is one of those times. you guys are my people and i guess i'm not really looking for solutions, just someone to remind me that it will pass and maybe offer up some tips on self-care."
anxiety,ptsd,85,"i’ve had the worst week of my life. pretty much lost the will to live. my anxiety has been at a all time high since i calmed it down a while ago. as seen via my last post i got sexually assaulted nearly 7 days ago and i’ve been going off the rails ever since. i’ve barely been sober and have been promiscuous which i’ve never been before and i have no idea why after my assault all i want it for boys to respect me and say the right things before any sexual activity occurs. i had a boy say to me he wanted to get to know me before we had sex even though it was a one night stand and if it wasn’t for that nothing would of happened between us. it gave me at the time some false sense of security knowing i’m worth something and i’m not actually just a disposable machine that’s only good for one thing and that’s it? i went out last night and i’ll spare the details as about 5 dknow a few of them don’t like me that’s evident and i’m not sure why because i’ve not personally met any of them that don’t seem to like me, a lot of it has to be because of the guy i used to see and another guy i used to see who was also there. there was also drama as on friday someone slyly took a picture of me with a boy who had his arm around me who has a girlfriend (which i didn’t know) so everyone knows it’s me but they’re only not saying anything because the boy would fight all of them and probably win and his girlfriend showed up and punched him in the face and said he cheated on her, so i was quite a big topic of conversation in that apartment clearly and it’s giving me such bad anxiety i’m just worrying what people think of me and what was said about me i just don’t know what to do... i feel like i need to redeem myself but yet i’ve just done nothing wrong?"
depression,anxiety,87,"you know the sound a plastic cup makes when you squeeze it too hard? when you are standing and talking to people and you look normal but you are trying so hard not to scream or cry or break down in front of everyone so instead you tighten your grip on your cup. you hear the sides crackle as they cave in. once you release, the cup pops back into its original shape but there are still white lines running down the side from where it bent. i feel like i am making the crackling noise and i am covered in white lines. it is stupid but it seemed fitting."
bipolar,ptsd,89,"seroquel 200 mg 3 times a day - for bipolar 1, auditory hallucinations; buspar 15mg 2 pills twice a day - for generalized anxiety disorder; zoloft 200mg a day for depression; klonopin 1mg - up to twice a day for panic attacks; remerol 15mg nightly for insomnia; topomax 200mg at bedtime for ptsd nightmares. without it all i feel like i am spinning out of control ready to be hospitalized....with it all i feel like i will never have a creative thought in my head again."
bipolar,depression,90,"i didn't care to do anything this year. the only reason i bought a cake is because i have a six year old. the only reason i'm posting is because... those younger than me: you'll be 31 one day, too. it gets better. you're worth every minute more of your life. i odied at 16 and struggled with suicidal ideations all throughout my twenties. i have an awesome kid. i decided to ask my fwb to be my bf yesterday and he said yes (wtf.) i am finally getting self discipline down and writing my books. i couldn't even imagine this all before. i've had the ups and downs but today, i am 31, and you'll get here one day, too."
ptsd,anxiety,94,i eat my feelings. sometimes it's worse than others. at the moment i'm going through a bad patch and i cant stop the feeling of needing to eat. does anyone else go through this? i just want to feel less alone
ptsd,bipolar,96,"i was a great man for a great many of years, however it had a toll that i never recognized. for 32yrs i was a resuscitation specialist. i was the one that brought back the dead. in the field then in the hospital icu's, and er's. i never went to a debriefing, never saw a psychologist/psychiatrist, i just buried my dead in a vault deep in my mind. now im broken. and lost. my only lucid moments now are moments that ive completely numbed my soul with scotch and weed. i oft wonder if i should take the final leap and end the suffering, the same as a patient with terminal illness who suffers, and the treatment is terminal mso4, via iv. the end comes quietly wrapped in the wisps of a morphine cloud. ..."
depression,adhd,104,"like you're put on the spot, and suddenly feel this pressure to sound interesting because you realize how boring your routine must appear to a third party. suddenly realizing you spend 70% of your time aimlessly browsing the same 10 subreddits, watching lize one day that i've never actually finished any project in which i've expressed interest. i already know that i will like myself a lot more, have better conversations, and more fulfilling relationships if i can just manage to flip this balance of time."
bipolar,ptsd,108,i had the worst one of my life tonight. i was psychotic and had a flashback to my attempt. multiple times. my hand was talking to me and telling me bad things. i have 3-4 nightmares a week and they aren't getting better. i don't know why this is happening.
bipolar,anxiety,109,"sorry for the rambling post. i just need a safe place to vent. i'm pretty much losing it. i haven't been to work all week because i'm crippled with anxiety and i've been super irritable, lashing out, experiencing hallucinations, and have been feeling incredibly suicidal. last night, my fiance had to basically sit on me to make sure i didn't hurt myself. i begged him not to bring me to the hospital. i think i should go to the hospital to get stabilized but i don't know if it will do much good as i know that when i get out i won't be able to afford the medication they'll put me on and i'll be back to square one. i'm sorry. i just feel so overwhelmed right now."
depression,adhd,110,it's 1:40pm and i am sitting alone in taco bell eating a shredded chicken burrito and nacho fries. dining room is totally empty. wendy's is normally where i go because the dining room is always more active and feels a bit more cozy vs the sterile decor and hard seats of taco bell but i am getting bored of eating the same thing so figured i'd have some tb instead. not even sure of the point to typing this other than than to share my boredom. outside of errands or making service calls to clients my fast food outings are usually the only time i go out of the house.
ptsd,anxiety,117,"for me, i have bought many books and i have spent lots of money on insurance, doctors visits, and medication. a significant area that i haven't invested in is therapy. instead, i have always sought out free therapy which may or may not be effective. so, what about you? what areas have you invested in?"
ptsd,anxiety,118,"long story short, when i was in elementary school, i was bullied relentlessly by a kid much older than me. he used to do all kind of unpleasant shit to me, but what i hated the most was being sat on or held down and tickled until i cried. he was too strong and i was defenseless. i hated it and finally broke down and told my parents. tworld just falls down around me. now, tickling is a fairly common things between families and friends, and i'm living in constant fear of it happening. i know, it seems incredibly strange and i hate talking about it. it's so embarrassing because it seems so trivial to everyone else. i haven't even managed to say it to my therapist yet."
depression,anxiety,121,"i hate it when my ""friends"" say this. i don't know if they don't care or don't know how to help or if they genuinely believe this. i've also gotten comments like ""stop being sad"" or (for my anxiety) ""stop worrying."" i don't know if people don't take me seriously or just don't want to. i ask for help, and no one answers (anymore, i pushed away the one person that did care about me and it kills me). i've just retracted into my own shell. no one understands the pain i feel (as edgy and cliche as that sounds) and i don't think anyone will even bother to try ever again. i don't fit anywhere. i don't belong here. i feel like at this point i'm just delaying the inevitable and that, if i did go, no one would miss me. no one would even fucking notice..."
ptsd,anxiety,127,"i’m so tired of having bad memory, it makes me feel so stupid. i’ve been watching the star wars movies with my boyfriend for the last week and i can’t remember hardly anything. i get the basic plots but names and details are always lost on me. i have to ask questions the whole time and it’s genuinely creeping out my boyfriend. he doesn’t understand how i can forget a detail from 20 minutes ago. i’m just sad. i use to have great memory and now i can’t even enjoy entertainment. i just feel like a shell."
bipolar,none,129,"so about a week ago my wife and i moved back from georgia to texas. we thought me driving all the way from georgia (she has no license) at night to texas in one trip. i thought not taking my depakote and risperdal for one day would be fine. ohhh what a stupid mistake that was. i started to hallucinate on the road. my arms grew huge and i felt like i was a mile away from my steering wheel. then my vision started to swirl. i had to call the police to escort us to the nearest hotel. people, your medicine is very important. please take it."
bipolar,depression,150,"i live in south texas. the weather here is always humid and hot as balls, however we are finally beginning to see some weather changes. it was pouring almost all day yesterday and this morning when i walked out of my apartment to leave for work, it was fresh! fresh and cloudy and so beautiful, but then i started to feel the depression creeping in. for fuck's sake *eyerolls so fucking hard*"
depression,adhd,159,i find that through it all the worst part is just being so tired all the time. like sure sometimes i’m in a lot of pain but basic tasks are always hard and i just want to be in bed. anyone else and any advice?
depression,anxiety,162,"i usually dont wash or fold unless i absolutely have to, so i typically look like a mess. having folded clothes made me a little more confident when i got dressed that i could make it through today."
adhd,anxiety,165,"not once did i believe i'd be able to make it through. i had come up with backup plans at least 4 times in preparation for the inevitable point i'd be asked to leave or fail out. turns out i was wrong. 3 as and a b. and the b was in the class i was ""certain"" i'd fail. anyone out there struggling to keep up, just know that no matter how impossible it seems to complete something or do something well, be it a paper for a class or a project for work or an application or an entire school program, or maybe even just reading a book, you can do it. we all can. this disorder doesn't have to define us. thanks to everyone here for being so supportive, you guys rock."
adhd,anxiety,169,"the two are actually quite similar, so i would definitely take a look to make sure that you are going down the right path. it is also called ""emotional dysregulation disorder"" and it includes impulsivity, trouble concentrating, and zoning out. rejection sensitive dysphoria can very easily be confused with a borderline's fear of abandonment. you also lack identity, so you cling onto mental illnesses for your identity and tend to lack values, morals, or goals. it basically gives you the emotional intelligence of a 3-year-old, and you lack object constancy. so basically, you are constantly suspicious and worried about a close person's emotions changing when they aren't constantly talking to you or directly in your area."
bipolar,depression,173,"last week i wore my hair up everyday to work. not because i particularly like the way it looks, but because i couldn’t will myself the effort to take a shower for 5 days. wearing my “depression” hoodie that is 3 sizes too big, just so i can ignore my weight issue and have it’s dog hair covered fabric drape around my already dirty pajama shirt that i wore the last 4 nights. being this kind of sad is funny that way even something as mundane and rudimentary as doing my laundry takes more effort f glitter about to explode taking shots at the bar with my friends and oversharing too much with too many people this happiness turns agitated and irritable every small inconvenience feels like i might just turn green, sprout some brown shorts and call myself hulk like a rubber band that is twisting tighter and tighter until it snaps. and cuts my arm with an exacto knife and down i fall again… when people ask me how i am they should just ask me who i am today and what does my laundry look like"
depression,bipolar,176,"now that i've struggles with this bullshit for 7 years, i've come to the realisation that literally no one cares no one is genuinely there for you. everyone will claim to be there for you and beg you to open up to them because they want to be the hero who 'saves'd because you just can't quite bring yourself to talk to people. going through days of mania followed by weeks of lowness and having people expect you to be okay because of those few days of mania everyone wants to be there for you until you actually show symptoms"
bipolar,ptsd,187,"i can feel the floor dropping out like the last time i was hospitalized. i can't go back there. it was traumatic. i've tried every med and i'm terrified. i turn into a fucking monster. i can't control it. i need help, but i don't wanna be sedated with meds and thrown in a cage. it feels like no one can help me. i just lost the love of my life and i don't know if i'll make it. idk what i'm expecting from this. i can't live like this. how do people make it? i can't believe i have to lose myself over and over until i die. i can't fucking do this. i'm so scared."
bipolar,anxiety,189,"came across this and thought they may be useful for anyone suffering from mild depression: does anyone religiously do cbt and if so did it help? **common cognitive distortions** a partial list from robert l. leahy, stephen j. f. holland, and lata k. mcginn’s [*treatment plans and interventions for depression and anxiety disorders*] (2012) 1. **mind reading** you assume that you know what people think without having sufficient evidence of their thoughts. “he thinks i’m a loser.” 2. **fortune-telling** you predict the future negatively: things will get worse, or there is danger ahead. “i’ll fail that exam,” or “i won’t get the job.” 3. **catastrophizing** you believe that what has happened or will happen will be so awful and unbearable that you won’t be able to stand i feel now,” or “my parents caused all my problems.” 10. **what if?** you keep asking a series of questions about “what if” something happens, and you fail to be satisfied with any of the answers. “yeah, but what if i get anxious?,” or “what if i can’t catch my breath?” 11. **emotional reasoning** you let your feelings guide your interpretation of reality. “i feel depressed; therefore, my marriage is not working out.” 12. **inability to disconfirm** you reject any evidence or arguments that might contradict your negative thoughts. for example, when you have the thought i’m unlovable, you reject as irrelevant any evidence that people like you. consequently, your thought cannot be refuted. “that’s not the real issue. there are deeper problems. there are other factors.”"
ptsd,anxiety,193,"i have this regularly and destroyed my social life once again a while back. i pushed away all people i love and lost basically every human connection. i feel like i'd just justify my behavior when explaining it to them and manipulate others into giving me another chance when i'll most likely do the same thing all over again in a few month/years. when i'm in such a state, i can't control it. i lose every human feeling and any empathy left in me. i don't think it's ever going to be any other way, so i don't care anymore. i'm starting to think that i should stay in this totally emotionless state just to stop hurting my loved ones."
ptsd,adhd,202,"i saw your post on weighted blankets and how it can help you sleep. it normally takes me over an hour to fall asleep and normally only sleep about 4-5 hours a night. i gave it a shot and bought a weighted blanket and for the past 2 weeks i have fallen asleep faster than my husband and sleep a glorious 7-8 hours straight. so thank you who ever posted that, because hat was what i clearly needed."
ptsd,anxiety,206,"this week has been god awful, but finding this sub and being able to relate / not feel so alone is really helpful and i’m really happy that this community exists."
adhd,anxiety,209,every single day it's the same. i'm 2 minutes late which has me run the way to the train station. it's always those 2 minutes. i hate it. i start hating myself for it. it keeps happening. why? and who else? how do you cope? it's a common pattern btw. also includes deadlines and other things. i'm always the exact amount of time late to make things uncomfortable.
depression,bipolar,211,"doesn't matter. depressed for over 16 years now. words mean nothing. two 51/50 holds meant nothing. medication changed nothing. group therapy meant nothing. moving out meant nothing. living with my best friends meant nothing. true freedom meant nothing. what's your secret to living comfortably? i'll never know. i'm so old and ""experienced"" that depression has just become funny in a sense, an ongoing joke that is my life. no wonder so many comedians kill themselves. this pain is hilarious."
depression,bipolar,219,"the shame and stigma that comes with being mentally ill can be very difficult to cope with, as most people can't see a crushed self like they see a broken leg. i have been going through the yet most difficult time, and what aches my heart is when i lose a friend or i feel the sucpesion of being lazy or acting up only se what i feel is taking life out of me every day, to many looks just like a failure at doing things right, or even if understood it still makes people undesirable and socially marginalized. so, is my thought common? or have i missed out on something that when i come to realize will make the thought sound preposterous?"
ptsd,anxiety,229,"the other day i or i should say we went on a 1st date with a woman i had just met a couple of days earlier. i say we, because my service dog was with me. after we had eaten, we were just chatting when all of sudden my dog jumps up and starts licking me. this is what she does when i start getting amped up. didn't train her to do it, she just does i had to get out of there. i could not sit still. i don't remember everything after the anxiety exploded. i don't remember driving home. i just couldn't think straight. i was short of breath. my heart was pounding. it had been such an amazing date up until that point. has anyone been thru anything similar?"
anxiety,ptsd,231,"i quit my job today. it was fucking terrible. not quitting, but being there. from september, i've had the worst time working there and trying my best for an abusive relationship. it took every fiber of my being to go through with it, but i feel like i've shed a ten ton husk. long time lurker, but i had to make an account to post this."
ptsd,anxiety,235,"i only feel comfortable communicating with people who have some sort of serious mental health issue themselves as well, or are professionals in the field, thus very understanding. i am so tired of being lonely and limited in my abilities to make connections with people."
depression,anxiety,236,"like the real laugh, from the heart... and its usually about something stupid but it feel so good and you stop and think of how long its been since that happened, and how you cant imagine that people are laughing and feeling like this all the time? when i get where i'm going i'm going to laugh and smile like that every day, and its going to be amazing."
bipolar,anxiety,237,"i feel like every time i have a conversation or try to, i’ll have em in the first half, but by the second i imagine the -2 social points from sims. it’s not just imaginary. after i get that feeling, i notice the people from those situations liking me less. i’ at me and my gut is telling me to stop and continuing on until i’ve ruined the atmosphere. telling a joke that is insensitive/being annoying/rambling/etc it feels awful because it does numbers on my reputation. it gets in the way of dating and making friends."
bipolar,anxiety,240,"someone reminded me the other day that there’s no cure for this disorder. as someone with a family history of it and someone who has been struggling with it most of my life, i objectively knew that, but i realized that this whole time i’ve been trying to change my medicine for almost a year, my mind has been hopeful for a cure. i have been wanting to cure it, not treat it, but actually be rid of it forever. wow. remembering that there’s no cure really hurts a lot and makes me kinda hopeless."
ptsd,bipolar,242,"i’ve tried celexa, wellbutrin, and zoloft with no luck due to how hard i was hit by the side effects. i was told that since i’ve had three failed attempts, my insurance would cover a dna test to see which meds i’m most compatible with but i needed something in the meantime. yesterday, in a bit of a funk, i went to my local head shop and bought a new vape and a bottle of 1200mg cbd juice, and- holy shit- the difference! this has changed everything in less than 24 hours and i am so humbled and grateful at the peace i’m finally getting. 🙌🏼"
depression,anxiety,250,i won’t give up i won’t give up i won’t give up i won’t give up i won’t give up i won’t give up. no matter what happens no matter how hard it gets i can do it i won’t give up.
ptsd,bipolar,254,"at 7:23pm my dad passed away five years ago today. i have been on edge all day. sneaking off to the walking fridge to cry when i don’t have too many tickets in the window. sunday’s are always hard because of brunch. staff and guests are always trying. i needed a moment and my boss told me to deal with it. i’m trying ok. i really am but there is a lot i didn’t get to say to him and a lot he didn’t get to do. he was an amazing scientist. it’s part of what killed him. he wanted to do a lot more work and research into diseases and the blood/brain barrier. but his lab forced him to retire early and he took it personally. he made the test for aids/hiv, hepatitis a,b, and c, west nile, and chagas’ disease. i just want to tell him i love him one last time..."
depression,bipolar,256,"am i the only one? am i being rude? there’s this coworker of mine who’s always so cheerful and laughs super loud and high pitch like some disney character. i try to think positive and understand that she’s actually a sweet person, but she irritates me. aaaand truthfully... i used to be bubbly and a people person. then shit happened. and now i just want to be left alone in silence. with my cat."
bipolar,anxiety,267,the creditors cannot chase me anymore. i won’t be able to buy a house or get credit again (thank god). bankruptcy can come across as a dirty word but 25% interest on a 5k credit card while i’m a student is just fucked up. i feel free.
bipolar,anxiety,268,i simply couldn’t handle the monotony and soul crushing nature of an office job for myself....and while that may be true of being a dishwasher it’s at least more mind numbing. i feel like i failed societal expectations and my family’s as well by ending up this way but it truly is the disease. this happen to anyone else? were you able to find contentment in simpler work?
ptsd,bipolar,273,"not all that unusual where i work actually. the supervisor i broke down in front of had his own breakdown about 8 years ago. its an engineering company that specializes in large, high risk sort of projects. so lots of crazy hours and stress. without realizing it, i went something like a week without sleep. i was supposeannot be on most meds), and various other things. nope....i get a couple of emails detailing the online videos i have to watch. ""sexual harassment: always a bad touch"", ""work place violence: serpentine to success"", ""msds and you"", along with ""export proprietary controls for intellectual property"" our hr department sucks."
ptsd,bipolar,276,"i seem to get so agitated sometimes, whether it’s with my family or friends, and i’m just to afraid to tell people why. i just constantly feel worthless, and i’m always on depressed and on edge. i wish i could just tell people why."
ptsd,bipolar,278,"i typed out a whole long vent post but then realized i really just wanted to know if anyone else had the same problem. my ex is the first out of many different guys who respected my boundaries and always made sure that our sex was fully consensual. we dated for a year, broke uherapy and that i will eventually find a man i can trust, although i am worried that i'll run into the wrong men before i find him. i'm just curious - how many of you have gotten too attached to people who treated you well after your diagnosis (or after you developed symptoms)?"
bipolar,adhd,282,"i was waiting for the bus after my group ended at the outpatient clinic outside the hospital. i was walking when i saw a male, on hospital grounds near the emergency room and outpatient clinic entrance, slitting his wrists with a razor. there were people everywhere. a group of women were sitting right next to him- but they all did nothing! i ran back into the hospital and told security about the man- but they also stood thhelp him. we were also across the street from a mental health emergency clinic. last week, i traveled outside the state to visit my brother who lives in a homeless shelter, and suffers from schizophrenia. i was just given a surprise diagnosis of add as well which has me worried sick. i also just celebrated my 30th birthday, but i feel like a complete mess! i don't know what to do besides remind myself 'that this will pass.'"
depression,bipolar,291,"sounds weird, right? but lately i've been so depressed that i've stopped caring about everything, to the point where it's actually making me happy. can't pay bills on time? oh well, who gives a damn! lonely on new year's eve, whatever, i really don't like people anyway. my social anxiety is going away too. because i no longer care about what people think of me. i've hit rock bottom, and it feels good! lol, i think i've officially lost it! :)"
depression,bipolar,301,"because they don't see it, they assume it's gone/not real. when you have a broken bone, or a physical illness, people ask how you're doing, and when you say it hurts, they believe you. they don't constantly act surprised when you show symptoms. when you're depressed, and you have a bad day, they'll be like ""what's wrong ? what's happening ? are you mad ?"" even when they know you're suffering from depression, a disease that's literally known for making people feel like shit."
ptsd,anxiety,318,"it may be bizarre to say this but ... i cannot think, i cannot feel, i cannot do anything because i am too scared to do anything because i cannot trust anyone because i feel that i am living among a world of sharks, just like in the world of game of thrones. i aood people out there and i applaud you for that but just like in the world of game of thrones, the good people always lose because is a messy, messy place that is filled and made up of lies and dirty work because somehow humanity is inherently evil, to this point"
adhd,anxiety,323,"seriously. i never realized other people struggled with as many of the same things that i struggle with. finding this community helped me realize that i'm not alone, and helped me better understand my mental illness. i am so grateful."
bipolar,anxiety,325,"i was curious what people thought if it so far. the little activities have been interesting, but the questions they ask about if you did this or that on these medications has been somewhat useless to me. i've been on multiple medications for the majority of my adult life, so i don't always remember what caused what. i always assumed the brain fog was related to medication, and i was really kind of sad to find that the disorder causes it."
anxiety,adhd,329,"i stay away from family and live with my roommate who literally games all the fuckin time! it's like he is happy he doesn't have to go to college anymore this is a blessing for him. he has no other interests i'm stuck in my head all day! this pandemic really makes it worse for those who need distractions to escape from all the overthinking and anxiety! trying to develop new hobbies such as reading and stuff, watching shows and movies also gets boring after a while"
depression,bipolar,332,"i’ve been feeling pretty depressed over the past 2 weeks, usual symptoms, might go to the doctor to check it it. anyways, i was wondering if it is normal for me to cry when i feel sad, i’ve heard a lot about only girls being allowed to cry and boys online being allowed to be angry or gritty or some bullshit. i get urges to cry everyday, no matter how the day turns out, from 9-4am i am sitting on my bed listening to my music while crying a lot."
bipolar,ptsd,338,"i gotta vent. dad, you've been giving mixed compliments for the past week. backhanded praise and shit. ""i don't care if you fail, i care if you try."" too fucking bad dad, i care more if i fail than if i try, and i get that that doesn't get me anywhere; it feels pretty shitty to be reminded my ridiculous rejection sensitivity makes me a terrible person. fine, impedes my success. you didn't call me a terrible person. but that's what i'm getting at. the rejection sensitivity. what amounted to ""your not trying for the sake of avoiding getting hurt disappoints and irritates me"" turned into ""you're a terrible person."" or maybe i took it to mean ""you're broken."" i often think i am. how do you think it feels when i submit 10 job applications and my brain does the same thing about not hearing back? how do you think it feels to be constantly looking at jobs trying to balance what i'm qualified for, what won't be soul-crushingly mind-numbing, and what will actually move me forward in life? and then after beating myself up to get myself to start and continue that process, getting discouraged either not hearing back or hearing i didn't get the job. and then there's: what if i actually here back? interviews are std am now telling myself ""you're gonna be the lazy drug using social security beneficiary nobody wants to get their money"" while i tell myself i don't deserve it because i feel like a liar. but you know what? it may hurt, **but i take it on for you**. because i acknowledge my debilitating fear of trying on the job front and would rather take on shame than let my failure to launch weigh you down. when i was growing up, i used to tell myself ""no one can hurt you more than your own family."" i think that's still true for me today. thanks dad. *do you know why i changed therapists after you got your cancer diagnosis?* **i wanted to make sure you'd be proud of me before you died.** i sure as hell don't feel like you are right now. tl;dr: my dad hurt me and pissed me off by telling me he doesn't feel like i try and expressing frustration at how much time i put into videogames (where i can at least feel successful at **something**) when i spent less time on videogames today than half of what i spend most days in general. seriously, videogaming and weight loss are the only two things i've succeeded at since graduation. maybe not dying, too, but i don't think that should count. good to know i'm a disappointment."
none,adhd,339,"maybe this way of saying it is fine, but when people ask around and compare test scores, i genuinely believe and want to tell people that they shouldn't focus on what other people scored but focus on themselves and their own work. i don't want to sound too formal or even rude since i am a student. so how should i reply to people asking whatever test mark i received?"
bipolar,anxiety,344,"so i have been working my ass off the past 2 1/2 years to get my head back together and take a bunch of classes i needed for education endorsements so i could get into masters in teaching program. i just found out i got into the program!!! wooo i'm going to grad school! 3 years ago i could barely get out of bed, this spring i'll be learning to teach at an excellent school and i just felt like sharing with people who would get how big of a deal this is to me. i am so happy."
depression,anxiety,346,this is becoming a problem. this is not the first time this has happened either. i am surprised i have not been fired. i just can't get up. i am so unmotivated. help! what can i do?
depression,bipolar,348,"when i was well i was pretty mentally healthy, could easily cope with everything, happy and successful. i had always been one of the smartest people in the class and at work. now that i’ve become depressed i feel brain damaged, things that i know i could have easily solved before seem impossible etc. now i’m beginning to wonder how much intelligence is really due to having the right chemicals in your brain than anything else. how can a child possibly succeed at school if their home life is bad (i know it happens for some supper resilient kids) but for the majority, maybe not so much..."
bipolar,adhd,352,"[screaming, crying, laughing, and vomiting - excerpts via i wish i could be ecstatic about this right now but my boyfriend broke up with me and moved out last night. not something to post about here though, that's a whole borderline personality mess between the two of us and for that specific reddit sub. anyway, here is my book. i'm gonna be working on making it into an ebook this week and buying it for myself so it can go onto amazon and other distributors."
depression,anxiety,353,i can't stand how people these days are patting themselves on the back for spreading awareness about mental health. there is still so much farther to go. we have not made nearly enough progress for complacency.
ptsd,depression,365,"outside of my husband and my mother in law, i have no one. i work from home so, no coworkers. i go grocery shopping and can do things outside the house if i need to so it’s not severe social anxiety or agoraphobia. i can have a conversation and i’m pleasink about me, or know me. i’ve even told my husband that if i die before him, please don’t have a funeral for me because i don’t even want anyone to know i’ve died, if at all possible. anyone else find themselves totally and completely okay with solitude?"
depression,adhd,370,"did my title catch your attention enough? good. because i have no idea what to write here. only time i need to use a subreddit like this is when i'm really freaked out, and when i'm upset like this i can't think straight and write some awesome cool post for you, sorry. edit: wow! i had no idea this would blow up like it did. the reason why i made a title that demanded such attention was because i saw all these other posts flying by with 1 or 0 comments on them. thank you for all the responses. i'm going to be writing an update post which will be titled something along the lines of [""my fate rests in this title: creative.. i know.. thank you and have a good day! edit 2: added link"
anxiety,ptsd,372,i have been getting more and more panic attacks recently and my mum thinks i fake them to be dramatic and get attention. i was having a pretty huge one and she hit me over the head twice quite hard whilst calling me pathetic which obviously just made it worse. shes been hitting me since i can remeault. yeah the double standards when being a middle child are great... i dont know what to do ive been gaslighted my entire life not to mention my stepdad is a police officer. ive got no family members who will support me but i cant go one like this. my mum needs to know what she is doing is wrong.
bipolar,depression,378,"you are climbing a mountain, it's hell, you want to give up , you push on and when you finally think you can't take another step, someone passes you on the way back down and tells you it's just 5 more minutes. a grueling ten minutes pass, you collapse on a rock and drop your pack. you see the summit. you lie on the ground for ten more minutes trying to shake out the last drops of water from the bottle into your mouth and they dribble down your face instead. you brought double the water everyone else did and it wasn't enoughiew was beautiful, you should see the view from the peak, it's amazing, so worth the trip, and you go wtf. you know night will come eventually, climbing up that mountain, never reaching the ""summit"", uncertain of how many hours you have left. only that night will come and then the struggle will end. stop making false promises that ""it will get better"". stop asking me to believe in fairytales. i don't want another false hope only to be shattered again like a glass falling to hard floor. i am so tired of picking up the pieces."
none,depression,385,"hi guys, just wanted to share this small story with you. meet my grandfather. he currently is 77 years old, broke his neck in the eighties in a car crash (and recovered), currently has heart problems and he has an electrical mobility scooter since walking does not come as easy as back in the old days. however, he refuses to ‘just sit behind the geraniums’ as the dutch people say, which basically means that he does not want to jusldren. his main messages to others is that “you are never too old to do something of which you think that you are not able to do it anymore. no, you just have to set your mind to it and this will enable you to do whatever you want to do. you are able to enjoy life every day if you have the right state of mind.” so what’s your excuse? ;) he also has a small blog, but sadly it is in dutch: some pictures for those interested: florian"
adhd,ptsd,387,"you know how sometimes you'll just remember something in the past you did and cringe at yourself and its like, kinda physically painful? that's the feeling i'm talking about. for most people it just kinda comes and goes and they are fine bearing it for a moment, however i seem to either be hypersensitive to the feeling or just really bad at regulating it (probably a bit of both tbh), as half the time ""i wanna punch myself"" doesn't stop at just being a descriptor of how and feel and ends up being a bit of how i cope with it til it passes :/ i'll end up hitting myself on my leg or arm or something or punching a nearby wall as a way to relieve the tension, never hard enough to leave a lasting mark but often enough to be worrisome. i know it's not healthy but i don't know what else to do cuz the feeling is otherwise ui'll end up having a panic attack, yet i pretty much never actively avoid possible triggers and even signed up for my school's improv and dance clubs completely out of my own freewill (actually participating, however, is a different matter). basically, never happens to me lol. does anyone have any advice on better ways to cope with the cringe feelings, or with just emotional regulation in general? i'm on ritalin ir rn and while it does seem to help a bit, the problem is still very present, especially later in the evening or at night where i'm more tired and the meds have worn off. **tl;dr i have general emotional regulation problems and specifically always end up coping with ""cringe"" feelings with self harm. does anyone have advice on healthier ways to cope or other general help with emotional regulation?** thanks!"
bipolar,anxiety,402,"i started new meds a few weeks ago, and i think i found a good combination that works for me. i don't wake up wishing i was dead, i don't get irritable as much and i can go out in public without becoming super anxious. it's been harder to fall asleep and i have a few other small side effects, but they're not terrible. it's just nice to not be in a terrible mood 24/7. i hope others can find medications that work for them too!"
depression,anxiety,408,"i'm talking about the kind of people who'd say ""talk to someone"" but would happily ignore you when trying to talk about it to them. this leads to feeling annoyed at yourself for bothering them and then bottling everything up and not talking to anyone about it."
bipolar,anxiety,410,"well lady... i run off to different countries, i steal cars, i get drunk, i take drugs, i have sex with strangers, i cut myself, i punch myself in the face, i try to kill myself, i have major anxiety and i’m baseline depressed 3 times a year. does that answer your question?"
bipolar,anxiety,418,"title says it all. i was bombarded this morning by my boss, essentially belittling me in front of the entire office. i sucked up like the man i am, and sat down behind my desk. and then it hit me. a wave on extreme anxiety and panic. my chest pounded like mad, i began to sweat heavily, the lights hurt my eyes, and my legs began to bounce and shake. i tried holding it back, that pain in the throat that makes it hard to swallow. i almost forgot how that felt. i ran to the back half of the office, stood out in secluded section of the warehouse and wept. granted it was for only about 30 seconds, i haven't felt such relief in so long."
ptsd,anxiety,421,"my new therapist has been really great. today in our third session she asked if i would be more comfortable talking if she wasn't looking at me. i'm never comfortable with eye contact so i always look away, but no one has ever noticed before that i don't like being looked at. she turned away and i looked at the wall for the whole session and it really helped! i am so glad for this. it made such a huge difference for me and i feel a lot better about our sessions in general. i feel kind of stupid but holy shit! a small thing makes a huge difference!"
depression,anxiety,423,"i absolutely hate this statement. the thing is, i think you can love someone even if you don't love yourself, and that in itself can be the reason the relationship falls apart. ""why don't you feel good enough? i love you, why isn't that enough? iand can't change now. it's too much of a comfort to dislike myself. is that annoying to handle? probably. but, it doesn't change the fact that i can love someone with my whole heart and not feel an ounce of love for myself. can anyone else relate?"

ptsd,anxiety,435,i've had them for several years and i'm passed getting suicidal/etc but it just gets really hard to breath and always ends up disabling me for a good few hours. obviously i know what's happening and that it will pass but i just need advice that will help it pass faster. i have 2 jobs and they are setting me back time wise so much and i'm just really frustrated.
anxiety,ptsd,439,"when i was younger my sister was seen as the ""pretty"" one and i was seen as the ""smart"" one. now i go to a university full of beautiful pretentious women and it makes me so anxious that i want to kill myself. i also just got out of an abusive relationship where my ex didn't give two shits about me so i'm sure that's contributing as well. nonetheless, i would love some advice or at least hear from other people who have dealt with a similar situation. thanks."
ptsd,anxiety,456,"it got to the point where i was ready to start working again. really just to help support my girlfriend, anyway it’s nothing glamorous, movie theatre usher, but getting out of the house has helped a lot. i’m very awkward and antisocial and have made it a point to be friendly and social with my coworkers and i’ve met a lot of people i like. yeah i’m still pretty awkward, but i’ve been my old funny like-able self. feeling pretty good right now, for the first time in along time i feel like a normal person. just thought i’d share."
ptsd,anxiety,457,ive come to the situation where i have a brand new partner who wants to hold my hand and this is coming to a head for me again. the second this happens i start to cry and they get put off. they ask if im uncomfortable literally every time no matter the person and i have to say no because its not normal. ive tried to muscle through it but the moment the hand holding gets to hand rubbing i cry again and so on. im 19 what do you think i should do? understandably all of my relationships are very short
adhd,anxiety,459,"they're both red, so they're totally the same thing, right? uuuuugh. and then i had to do the awkward ""oh no, actually i can't buy that, i'm so sorry"" thing and run away. so embarrassing. and even better, my car is in a parking garage and i'm going to have to call my boyfriend to come bring me money so that i can get it out. super awesome job today, self. sorry, just needed to vent. do neurotypical people really not do this shit all the time? because i feel like i do it way too often."
depression,bipolar,464,"i took a number of ssris during my last depressive episode and wellbutrin xl was the only one that made me flip into ""good days"" on occasion, however, would often slip back into depression after i went to sleep and woke up. i finally got out of my last depressive episode was flipped into a ""good day"" twice where i feel normal, energized, have my motivation back and feel like my old self. i tried to get angry and vowed to wake up to being feeling good, but sadly, the next morning i was back to a deep depression. has anyone else had this experience?"
adhd,none,472,"i often have people bring up songs/albums/bands or movies/tv shows during conversation. they might say, ""have you seen or heard x?"" and if i have i will say ""yeah, i liked it, enjoyed it etc etc etc"". however, as soon as they go into more details such as band members or actor names, favourite lines from movies or lyrics from songs i can't actually remember any information beyond a couple of bits even though i know i've seen/heard it and i liked it. i fear it makes me appear as a compulsive liar who says they like things just to fit in when in reality i just cannot remember many details, lines, names or lyrics, just i enjoyed said movie/show/album etc. anyone else get this? feelsbadman.jpeg."
adhd,anxiety,474,"fairly new to this subreddit (been browsing it for about a week) and i'd just like to say that i absolutely love the energy on this sub. from your posts i've found people who understand exactly what it's like to be me and i've never felt as understood with anyone irl as i have on this sub. i wish we could be one big internet family because these are the types of interactions/friendships i crave irl. but for now, have this cyber hug of appreciated, you guys are the best."
depression,anxiety,475,"you know, that endless commentary telling you how awful you are, or how you're screwing up, or how you keep making the same mistakes? that inner fountain of negativity and despair? or is it just me? i think it's a common experience, but it's hard to know when surrounded by people who aren't openly struggling with anything in particular. i've also been told mine is very mean. there are many expletives and much name-calling is done. what's yours like?"
depression,anxiety,479,"everyday in high school i see people who can be engaged in certain classes and discussions out of what seems like interest. sometimes i see or hear about a student who went above and beyond on something. or, at the very least, i notice people who can do work and study for tests reasonably ahead of time. every time i see one of these things i feel jealous, sad, and sometimes almosly interested in any of them. college is coming next year, and i have no idea what i'm going to do, or if i even have the motivation to make it through. it's been difficult enough pretending like i care in high school. any kind of work is just a massive mental chore to get through. if it weren't for my massive anxiety and fear of falling out, i probably wouldn't get anything done."
ptsd,anxiety,486,"i went to a pool party this weekend for a friend's birthday i made playing dnd. one of the guys there picked me up in the water, i said ""i don't like touching,"" and he dunked me. he brought me back up, and i said ""stop! i don't like touching,"" and he dunked me again. a group of his friends was standing very close and could have stopped it, but i wasn't listened to with the respect i deserved. so, this guy got to grab me, put me in a panic attack, and have a great party with no repercussions. meanwally my mother failed to believe me and extract me from a nightmarish situation. just like i did everything right at the party and a group of my so-called nerd friends left me to deal with the situation on my own. i've also been struggling with feeling like i'm making a big deal out of a small flirtatious move. but it's the speaking my boundaries and wishes and having them ignored that feels so, so much like i'm 8 again. i'm 8, and i just have to acquiesce to a man's wishes and not consider my own."
ptsd,anxiety,490,"too much horrible shit has happened to me in the past few weeks. one of the things i can't tell my parents. i have been going around house to house staying with other people because i want to avoid my parents. due to my other mental health issues, i still live at home at age 27 (i know,pathetic) and i feel like i can't be around them rig bitch to me. didn't care that i couldn't sleep. i had to go to the e.r. (i have medicaid) to get sleeping pills that actually work because she wouldn't return my call after giving my trazedone, which doesn't even work. i'm so angry at everyone. even my therapist who i told my problem to, i don't think he takes me seriously. i'm so tired."
anxiety,ptsd,492,"my anxiety when i first wake up everyday is so strong i struggle to leave my bed. i wake up from a typically sound sleep and get thrown into a shitstorm nearly everyday. i used to have ptsd related nightmares; thankfully those have died down but it sometimes feels like all the anxiety just builds up overnight and needs to get released every morning. i feel plastered to my bed with a racing mind that i can't control. i've tried things like ""you know this will go away in an hour. just ride it out"". i've tried grounding techniques. i've tried different types of weed and different benzos. i'm thinking about doing a small meditation everyday to see how that makes me feel- are there good apps out there i could try?"
ptsd,anxiety,493,"like it says, something feels wrong. i can taste in my mouth that something isn't right. it's as if i'm looking at everything through a different light, like my mind is seperate from my body. i feel all these signals going off in my head, that tell me to run and to leave. my brain is filled with all these screaming noises. not voices, not people telling me to do things, but it's as if every thought i have is being screamed throughout my head. i can feel in my chest that something is wrong, it's not anxiety, it's my heart pumping so loud. it feels like something very bad is about to happen."
ptsd,depression,498,"i'm 26 now and 8 months ago my (first ever) girlfriend of a year killed herself, i was the first to find her. i've moved to a different state and tried to keep busy, but time isn't seeming to help. i got back into college, but 2 weeks in i haven't been able to do an ounce of homework and don't want to go to class. i had big hopes that starting school would help but it only has stressed me out. tomorrow i'm supposed to go to class but i'm planning to just drop them all. i'm a former marine and spent time in iraq and afghanistan, but that's nothing compared to losing my baby the way i lost her."
adhd,bipolar,500,today i almost feel like... manic? i don't want to minimize what it's like to have an actual manic episode but goodness gracious my mind is racing. and i cannot focus on anything and feel like need to do something crazy. (more than i usually do hahaha)
ptsd,bipolar,505,"i am so tired of fighting. this illness has taken everything from me. i’ve fucking tried the self help books, ive tried therapy, i’ve tried emdr, i’ve tried meditation and mindfulness, i’ve tried sobriety. everything just keeps getting worse. and now i lost the only thing i fucking care about.minute, using drugs, finding drugs, or buying drugs. i’m fucking done guys. i give up. i’m done trying i’m done pretending things get better, i’m done trying to pull my pathetic ass out from the dirt. thanks for being such a great community over the years. throw away account for obvious reasons"
none,ptsd,506,most people get relased after 14 years or earlier after commiting brutal crimes like murder . but here is a man who spent 54 years in prison without committing a crime and without facing a trial . the entire system is a joke. god knows how many such people are still in the prsion.
none,depression,509,"at 14 years old he saw his beloved grandma get shredded with bullets by the man he used to play with. at 21 his father was blown up by terrorists. he didnt even get to see his father's body one last time. deaths are never good. people always get hurt for life and some take a lifetimrage because when you take out the political figure out of him, he is a person who suffered too much too early in his life. something most of us will never or never did suffer in life. i dont support congress, but lets not insult or let neech aadmi's insult and hurt those soft spots."
depression,bipolar,520,i've been in a major depressive episode for the last two years or so and lately i find myself only brushing my teeth maybe once a day and showering only once a week. i was just wondering if anyone else struggles with this at different times during a depressive episode.
depression,anxiety,521,"it's getting hard for me to remember a lot of things and my brain is always foggy. i had a job interview earlier and i could have sworn i heard the manager say that *she'll* give me a call this afternoon, and i haven't heard anything from them, and now i'm having a miniature crisis because i don't know if that's what i actually heard or she actually said *tomorrow afternoon* or she said she wanted *me* to call this afternoon or tomorrow afternoon or if i heard her correctly and she just didn't bother to call me and gave the job to somebody else. this is so fucking frustrating, i feel like i can't trust my brain and it makes me feel like an idiot. please tell me meds can fix this..."
depression,anxiety,525,anyone else sick of other people ? i feel like nobody gets me and for some reason i attract drama and i sometimes believe it’s due to jealousy from other people. every time i come out of my shell and be myself i always seem to attract bad people and i don’t know if it’s because i’m highly empathetic and people sense it. urgh i’m just gonna revert back to being quiet and to myself. honestly
depression,bipolar,530,"i've joined this sub-reddit filled with pure agony with all the things i've experienced in school, family, and myself. but eversince this year, i've managed to find love, gain my old friends with a handful of new ones, and i've finally become academically stable. everything iss of wanting to dissapear and hoping for death to come. i thank you guys for helping me in a way that is unnoticable but very remarkable, i hope that i won't be alone in getting out. it's very pretty here i hope that i get to meet you all once again. music helped me alot too :)"
depression,bipolar,535,"sometimes i feel like i'm not depressed... i'm just lazy. i lack motivation. i lack self-confidence. i like to complain and whine and talk about how hard life is. i feel so guilty when i'm sad, because maybe i'm just feeling sorry for myself. i'm just self-absorbed and immature. and if i would just stop being so selfish and lazy, then i would be normal like everyone else. but... i'm so sad. i can't help that i feel this way. and i exercise and i try to eat right. i work hard. i make plans with friends. i try not to drink too much. i don't do drugs. but i get home and i'm alone, i feel so sad. so alone. so hopeless. i don't want to work. i don't want to try anymore. i just want to give up on everything. but when i talk to friends ort suck at life? i try so hard to make myself better but maybe in the end i'm just lazy and self-absorbed and that's why in unhappy. update: thank you all for your replies and kind words. i'm amazed this post got so many comments and likes. and even though i don't know you guys, it has made me feel really supported on these really bad days. i saw a new psychologist today who diagnosed me with with an adjustment disorder, coupled with anxiety and depression. she referred me to a prescriber, but i have to wait a couple weeks for an appointment. hopefully i can get some meds then. even though i don't feel any better, it's a little comforting to have a diagnosis. and even more comforting to know this community exists. thank you so much."
adhd,anxiety,547,"i just wasted my entire morning stress-procrastinating on two tiny 2-page papers, and now i have to go to class empty-handed *again*. these papers are 3 weeks overdue. my professor has the strictest policy for late work i've ever seen -- if you miss even a single assignment, no matter how small, you fail the entire course. i managed to convince her to at least let me hand in work late for an f (thank you campus disability center), but i *need* to write these goddamn papers this week or else i automatically fail the class. how do you break out of this cycle? it's humiliating to be completely paralyzed by something so small."
anxiety,depression,551,i feel drained and exhausted. every day. even when i exercise. i'm so lonely but no one ever hangs out with me or talks with me. most of my friends left and now i'm back to where i started. :/ i feel guilty to and idk why. i've never experienced this type of sadness before
bipolar,anxiety,560,"i am in grad school. i have two assignments to do before the end of the month and i'm not gonna do them. one was due dec 15, last year! accessibility services helped me get an extension to april 30. i haven't done any work on it. the anxiety is so high about it i'm not going to get it done. and i can't work on the other one, because then i'm not working on that one. i've sought help from accessibility services at school. i met with a learni the water. how many times do i get to ask for help? its not fair. i'm taking resources from the people who ask for help and then actually make use of it. the cycle is just going to continue. depression, procrastinate, anxiety, depression, ask for extension, depression, procrastinate, anxiety, depression. i hate it. it doesn't stop. my thoughts keep arriving at the only way to make it all stop entirely. but i don't want that. i don't think."
bipolar,anxiety,561,"i'm just curious to see if this happens to anyone else; the title is pretty self explanatory. (tl;dr at bottom) i don't mean like i'm ""out of it"" or even just fatigued for the day and my brain loses its train of thought one too many times. i feel like that happens to everyone at least once in a while (including myself). i mean like it takes an insane amount of mental energy for me to say a sentence from start to finish correctly, usually takes me a few tries to do so. so to say a 3 sentence response to somethiow to speak in general. anyone else have similar experiences? tl;dr: does anyone sometimes find their speech to be very impaired, like you feel as if you forgot how to speak at all? maybe due to an episode, personal issues, both, etc? edit: thank you so much everyone who replied to this post, sharing your experiences and such. one of my biggest insecurities is my speech (due to the issue mentioned in this post) and it's so comforting to have so much nice, supportive feedback and to know i'm not alone on this :)"

adhd,anxiety,569,"it's the highest my gpa has been in my entire life. i can hardly begin to describe the combination of triumph and excitement and hope for what's to come, along with with the melancholy of what could've been, and the dread for how it might all go wrong. you guys know the feeling i'm talking about right?"
adhd,anxiety,574,"apologies for the use of that word in this post, for those who might be sensitive to it. *edit again* copy/pasting a comment to another user: where i'm from people use it as a slur toward the autism community. i'm actually not even sure it's just where i'm from - i see it all over the internet too. i don't personally think they're synonymous but since i witness ""autistic"" and ""retarded"" being used in the same sentence by shitty people all the time, i only wanted to be clear that i don't feel the same way and that i don't want to hurt anyone with my post :( that's why i had previously written that i don't use that word, nor would i ever call someone that anywt. but when i argue with my boyfriend i can barely remember what i've just said...i can't always remember how the argument even started. i get really flustered and then that gets worse. all i seem to hear is ""you're wrong."" i'm not always good at getting across what i mean the first time, either. so in frustration last night, my boyfriend asked me ""are you retarded?"" and it honestly hurt me a bit. i know some of you have had people ask you that. you start giving the question some thought because you feel you can't do anything right, ever. i'm not sure why i'm making this post...just feeling down in general. fucks with me every time, when someone asks me that."

ptsd,depression,630,i really need some support i’m feeling over the edge semi suicidal because i feel like i’m failing at everything. i can’t even make friends. maybe i am just a bad person. maybe everything my ex ever said was true. i just feel like such a failure and just have no enthusiasm to keep fighting. need some encouragement. i have no one.
depression,anxiety,631,"i really let it get out of hand this time folks. i got an email today saying i’m being excluded from my academics (meaning won’t be able to go to class...) because i didn’t pass 2 of my classes. so now, my choices are 1. talk to the dean to see if i qualify for a cancellation of exclusion, 2. get suspended, or 3. drop out of school. this really pte limit. i’m not sure if i’ll be able to take it. i can’t live with my parents again. my dad doesn’t believe in mental illness whatever that means. thinking about this situation makes me hate everything. im so done with life. i don’t know why i even try anymore. i knew i wasn’t cut out for college and i might as well give up and go waitress again"

bipolar,adhd,635,"i've been having a weird feeling lately, a lot like what i experienced two years ago when i first went off all psych meds. i'd been on medication since i was 11, for more than half my life (most of which only made things worse) and it felt like i was seeing the world for the first time. i had missed out on so many normal teenage/early 20s experiences and there was just so much i hadn't figured out. but while i'm still not sure my medication is even helping me, the one thing i do know is that quitting drinking has given me a similar sense of clarity. not that i was drung your medication as prescribed but still abusing substances, i'll be honest and say... you're probably going to have a rough time. while i don't think complete abstinence is necessary for everyone, i feel like just not drinking at all makes things a whole lot easier for me. of course alcohol is pretty much unavoidable in our culture... and yeah, it does get lonely at times. but i don't have to stress my brain thinking about when i'm crossing the line. and that just makes everything so much easier. believe me, it's better on the other side. i'm doing good. you will too."

(this is not an advertisement, just an idea. i don't work for movie pass.) i spoke to my private showing. so maybe if you're like me and love movies, a subscription service may be the thing to help you leave the house. amc theaters also has a subscription service for $20 a month if you can afford that. (this is in the us). sinema has plans starting at $4.99 a month. if you love movies and want to have a motivation to leave the house once in a while, this may be a good idea for you."

anxiety,none,966,"ok i had to make this post. the media, nowadays, lives off fear and clickbait. the scarier the headline, the more clicks that will come about. the more clicks, more money! when you read a headline, breathe in, and out. and we are the targets. the ones who legitimately have health issues surrounding world events. i was spurred on to make this post due to a headline i rea different things!! one implies trump is about to launch a full on attack onto the country, one simply reinforces what america's been saying for years, if nk attacks sk, america will defend sk. this pisses me off, it hurts me and many others physically and mentally, it affects our lives but these greedy editors and will go to the greatest lengths to make a bit more cash."
adhd,none,986,i just got finished with an interview and as the boss was walking me to the door he asked me what kind of music i listen to. i had absolutely no answer. i listen to music every single day. i listen to new bands and artists every day. but yet i don't know what i listen to. i can't recall names or bands or songs or artists or anything. i love all genres too. i just know that when i turn on my spotify playlist something i enjoy will play. anybody else have this? i can listen to an album 100 times and not know what the album name is or what my favorite song off that album is called. it's so frustrating talking to people about music because i can't recall anything.
depression,anxiety,989,"i made it. fuck everyone who put me down. fuck the bullies, fuck the cliques, i did it. but more importantly, thank you to everyone who kept me going. it brings me to tears thinking about how thankful i am to be here today because of my family, friends, and the wonderful people on this subreddit who helped me when i was down. i feel so immensely proud and happy right now because of my achievements. to all the people struggling through high school and college, there is light at the end of the tunnel. i love you all!!!!"

depression,bipolar,1049,"well, today marks 24 years from the day i was born. and for as long as i can remember, it's still one shitty fucking birthday. last year was pretty shitty. i lost my best friend, my job, had not a dime to my name and was suicidally depressed. this year i'm on medication and i'm trying to be happier, to move on and to make a better man out of myself and to just try to be.... better. of course life wants to bitch slap me in the fucking face. so far since waking up i've found out that the police have recovered my wallet that was stolen a week ago. the wallet that had every shred of id in it. all the id was torn to pieces e i checked my bank account, they've taken out the monthly fees. there were other bank fees and yet another statement fee that they keep not reversing or taking off my account despite getting no statements. all in all? -$29. so i had about 68 cents to play with by the time it was all said and done. i mean is it too much to ask for a fucking break in my fucking life? for one fucking day where i can actually say that it's fucking mine and i can enjoy it or do i have to suffer through this fucking bullshit for the next goddamn century? if so i'll fucking finish it now. i am so fucking sick of this shit. fuck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

ptsd,anxiety,1119,"i was 21 at the time, now i'm 22. in may of 2017, i got really sick out of no where. in a matter of 3 days, i went from feeling slightly out of it, to intense thunderclap headaches, pale, body aches, delirium, and ultimately passing out. i didn't want to make a scene or go to the hospital because i was just starting a new full time job, but i had a feeling that i was going to die. i can't really explain that very well, but i just knew deep down that someone was very wrong. at 4am i took an uber to the hospital and when i got there, upon checking my vitals (very low blood pressure and 160 resting heart rate) the nurses helped me onto a wheelchair and wheeled me into a bed in the intensive care unit. at this point, my memory is very groggy but i remember multiple people helping me take my clothes off to change me into a gown, and then doing an ecg on me. they got an iv into me and gave me a valium injection, as well as nausea medicine. i thought that was odd because i didn't feel nauseous at the time. the doctor came in and asked me what was wrong. i just cried and said my head hurt so bad, adn't push me too hard my fist few weeks back (i have a very physical job). now i'm healthier, but i still have a constant fear of getting sick again. i try to explain this to my mom and friends, but they think i'm just being dramatic and a hypochondriac. i don't feel safe anywhere but the hospital. i'm constantly scared. i don't have a fear of death, but knowing that i could easily become diseased and suffer, and leave all that i love behind makes me sad. it makes me sad that people don't understand what i went through. they are not educated on sepsis and think well ""hey, she didn't have cancer"" (my coworker actually said that, and later attributed my sepsis to being a vegetarian). i really don't talk about it a lot, but when i do, i get eye rolls. it's like people think i enjoyed taking a month off work. i constantly suffer from panic attacks now, where i feel dizzy and can't breathe well, but there's not much i can do about that. ativan doesn't help. my body and mind have been through hell and no one understands, or gives a shit. thank you for reading, i just had to get this off my chest."

bipolar,ptsd,1152,"so, as we all know, many managers are very unforgiving and aren't very keen on helping you out when you're not doing well. most of my past managers have treated me poorly, and when i tell them of my bipolar, they scheduled me less or looked at me differently, in a bad way. my current job as a manager, i cannot allow any of my emotions to clog me. and i'm quite good at it, especially since i've been put on medications that have made me so stable i often forget to worry about mood swings. but, a while ago, i was sexually assaulted and it comes and goes in waves all the ptsd stuff. but i deal and move on. a few days ago i had a completely meltdown at work and i couldn't shake it off. i went to the back and cr had blown up and i was angry and upset. i told him i would need a few days in november for court and he gave a look that wasn't the standard ""i'm so sorry"" look but the ""i'm surprised i didn't know"" look. and where i was going the entire time was, he told me if i ever needed pto that i could tell him. i didn't need to tell him what the court was about, but he told me that if i needed time, let him know. this guy i've fought with since day 1 understood my situation with clarity and empathy and told me to tell him if i needed pto. i didn't think that would ever happen, but it did. i appreciate him so much more than i did before. i love being validated and understood by someone who has never experienced this."
anxiety,ptsd,1154,"my wife passed out from a panic attack yesterday in the theatre while we were watching *a quiet place*. i was so scared and didn't know what to do. about an hour into the movie, there's a scene where someone steps on a nail. it wasn't even very gory, but i guess it triggered some bad memories for her. a few seconds after that scene, my wife's arm started twitching kind of like a seizure. at the same time, she started making sounds like she was snoring or maybe choking. when i looked at her, her head was lolled to the side and her eyes were closed. not realizing what was happening, i nudged her a bit, thinking she had fallen asleep. when her head rolled to the other side and there wasn't any other response my concern sky-rocketed. i took her head in my hands and gently shook her a little bit trying to wake her up. her eyes partially opened, and i could see her pupils were looking up like when you roll your eyes. there was no other response. i tilted her head forward and the ""snoring"" sound stopped, but she was still unconscious. at this point, about half a minute or so had passeder feel safe. i tried to just hold her and comfort her. after about a half hour she was doing better. i felt so helpless when she was unconscious. it's very scary when you suddenly realize your loved one is having a medical emergency. later in the evening, she revealed to me that when she was a teenager, she had an abusive boyfriend that would rape her, cut her with a scalpel, and poke her with needles. sick stuff like that i guess. she wouldn't say much more about it than that. i am angry. not at her, but at the thought some sicko did this to her. and i hurt. i grieve that she has experienced something so traumatic it causes this type of thing. she agreed we will get her into some therapy. she needs healing that i never knew she needed. i also know this isn't about me, but i feel a bit hurt this is just now coming out. we've been married about 5 years, and i never knew this stuff. what else don't i know? i don't know what type of advice i'm looking for. how can i be there for her? how can i help? what do i do if this happens again? did i do the right thing both during and after?"

depression,ptsd,1209,"i live a very mediocre, sometimes even luxurious life. i’ve never been through any trauma or abuse or loss. and yet i’m severly depressed and i hate life so much. when i see other depressed people who’ve been through real trauma, it makes me feel extremely guilt. i feel like i’m a spoiled little bitch and i want to be punished for it. sometimes i fantasize about having horrible things happen to me or i exaggerate the somewhat bad experiences i’ve been through just so i can validate my depression. is there a name for this phenomenon? and does anyone else experience it?"
anxiety,adhd,1213,"when i was about 12 (25 years ago), i used to have this group of friends that i would go out to lunch with to restaurants near school on half days. one day at school, i overheard this one guy who was in the same group ask another guy in the group if i was going to lunch that day. the other guy said no, and the first guy said ""good, because raingodofmorning is so annoying."" then he turned around and saw me, and gave some half-hearted, awkward, non-apology. i've never really gotten over this, and i have a fear of hanging out with people and them secretly wishing i wasn't there because i'm so annoying, but me never knowing about it. and i actually think that i might be pretty annoying to be around. my brain works really, really fast and i have anxiety and adhd, so i talk fast and i cawe should get dinner sometime"" that sounded like the clichéd thing people say when parting, regardless of whether they mean it. this is something i've identified as an external clue (as in, not something from my own head) that they might also find me annoying. i'm not quite sure if i should work on: (a) just accepting that i am an annoying person and being okay with keeping my contact with others limited in order to avoid inadvertently thrusting myself upon a social group one too many times, or (b) if i should work on convincing myself that i'm not annoying, even if it isn't really true. (i do see a therapist. this is one of many issues we work on, but it is very slow going). anyone with similar experiences? any thoughts/advice/opinions (that fit within the rules of this community)?"

depression,bipolar,1245,"kinda shitty advice. but i'll start with some backstory. i'm on mobile so forgive me. (this will be kinda rambly) i was diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety disorder after i checked into a psychiatric hospital a few years back, but i always felt as i grew up that something was wrong. when i went to go meet my biological mother (who is very bipolar) when i was 18 things started to click with me that i needed to figure out a way to find meaning. it didn't help that my step-mom was an abusive cunt. so overall i kinda suck at being a person.(still do) anyways, i've struggled with constantly feeling down, and also feeling a whole lotta shit i didn't really understand. because of this i turned to weed and alcohol when i was 15. went through a few phases of drinking hard, but really weed was my poison of choice(still dont think it's bad but that's for another sub). again anyways because of the plant i kinda regained a sense of what it meant to be a healthy functioning member of society, but it was  pay the rent, things get complicated with family, with work, with life. and all of it together makes me wanna opt out. but then i think of leaving him by himself to deal with it himself and what a living hell that would be. even if i cant do much, ill do what i can till i can't. because if i dont that would make me sadder than anything i can ever encounter in my life. my point is that out there there are strong, amazing, incredibly intelligent and driven people, who do this shit alone. while feeling everything. and its heart breaking. my dad spent his life trying to make me feel welcome when every fiber of my being says i don't belong on this earth. the least i can do is gtfo bed and try to do something. even if my battle that day is just to brush my teeth. so that he can see a good looking smile that he made. to make him feel just a little better. that's my part, my mission. thats what gets me up. there are people that can use your help, and you owe it to them. but that s just my opinion."

bipolar,adhd,1306,"so in the title, within quotation marks, are what i've heard from people i spent the most time with. 1) my mom, 2) a now-ex boyfriend, and 3) a former friend. 1) my mom kinda blew up in the parking lot of a hospital. the doctor said i didn't need a cough pill for my infection, and would be fine with only the prescription she gave me, and then my mom asked if she could prescribe me with a cough syrup. the doctor agreed to prescribe a strong cough syrup, and i asked if i don't need a cough pill, ""do i need cough syrup?"" the doctor said no, but said ""the medicines won't react with one another,"" and ""if you want a cough syrup, i can prescribe one."" *but i don't.* my cough won't go away (respitory infection) until the steroids kick in, but it will go away. i don't like taking meds i don't need. i'm defensive about this, because every time i have respitory issues, my mom asks the doc for a cough syrup ""for my own good"" and i feel like shit bc it's got some depressive drug in it, and i feel ultra sluggish the morning after i take it. i don't need it so i'm adverse to taking it. my mom says it's ridiculous that i have a cough and won't take a cough syrup, when no cough syrup was prescribed or suggested. the steroids will take it's course. but mothers will be mothers. i just hate taking drugs i don't actually need. (and i'm 18 so i'd think the doctor would have asked me first. guess not.) anyway she called me ungrateful and wouldn't let me speak and i dunno. it hit me. she said: ""i'm better off dead than i am alive to you, because nothing i do as your mother makes you happy."" i wanted to shoot myself in the mouth right there and then, ngl. i know that isn't the (logical) answer to this, but she isn't the only one who's said stuff like this. 2) my ldr boyfriend of two years broke up with me last night. he says he doesn't feel like he can talk to me, because he says offhanded things, and for a while, i didn't address them until months later (which is toxic). and now he feels that he'll fuck up no matter what he does, so what's the point. in the past i've addressed things as they came up and he either made fun of me, got super defensive, or asked ""so what's the problem?"". for example: he didn't speak to me for long periods of time. for like. a year. cancelled majority of skype dates at the last second. i said that i knew he has other obligations, but that still felt a bit emotionally neglected. (being left on read for days and sometimes weeks, not hearing from him for months, reading an ""i love you, too"" from him was rare. i felt like he didn't like me.) but he said that i had no reason to believe that. he had a roommate who made me cry, and he didn't defend me. even if i say that i didn't appreciate a comment, he would just join him. of course, he didn't mean to be rude, and of course he didn't mean to overlook my crying, didn't mean to misunderstand me. but he refused to buy earbuds because of his ""indispoable income"" (even if he went out to drink once a month). which gave his roommate ammo to be a bully. so i mailed my then-bf earbuds and he lost them. it felt as if he didn't put any effort into the relationship, and was justifying himself. when i asked if he wanted to break up, he sounded surprised and confused as to why. said that he loves me. i wasn't angry, just hurt and confused with all the mixed messages. but i said i believed him and ignored my gut. plus, on holidays, he drives six hundred miles in one go to visit me (and his family. so contrary to what he says, i'm not the only reason he comes to the city i live in.) but he said ""you think i wanna see my family? barely anyone there wants to see me. i'm driving for nine hours straight just so see you. of course i love you."" he gave multiple examples of his responsibilities, asked if i understood, and still asked what the problem is. i couldn't teents to me and to other people. i understand how depression can be; but that doesn't excuse her from being mean. from playing rough and with scissors (as a seventeen year old). from going out of her way to patronize people. but she put on her snapchat story her suicidal thoughts, talking about how everyone she knows is against her. so i swiped up, let her know that i apologize if i wronged her, and that i want her to be okay. that i don't think anyone is against her. that i am here if she needs to talk. she said that i can't make her pity me, and i was baffled. that she doesn't have the energy for my bullshit. (yikes.) that i shouldn't play nice if i don't feel nicely about a person. (still don't know what's she was talking about but it was childish. but still yikes.) and then she said all i do is complain about my family problems and boyfriend and do nothing to fix it. (that was when i said ""good to know,"" and blocked her. hehe.) it's so funny that she *asked me* what's wrong, didn't accept ""nothing"" for an answer, and then secretly hated when i was open and honest. i thought she was my friend. but i guess only therapists are meant to hear your problems. anyway. i digress. days after i blocked her, she came around me in person. went out of her way to sit next to me. acted fearful, as if i would reject her. took every single chance she got to be overly nice. for example: i was presenting and the class (of 13 people) was talking over me. she stood up, cupped both hands over her mouth, and projected: ""everyone! chris is talking! it is important to hear what they say, so that they can finish their presentation!"" sat down, then grinned at me. the class had the same weirded-out expression as i did. like. ugh. that was so artificial that it hurt me. i have a floridan friend who i tell some of these situations with, and he says it sounds like the other person has some unsolved problems of their own. my therapist said the same thing about all three scenarios. that nothing i complain about is like. ""i'm so sad my dad got me a blue car. i wanted a red one."" y'know? like the problems that bother me are literally ""so i'm homeless and don't know where i'm sleeping tonight "" or ""i got 27 spider bites in my sleep"" or ""my mom is threatening to kick me out and i'm an unemployed student"" or something that can't be given advice, because it's totally out of anyone's control. like when my car got totalled and i kept having flashbacks about the crash throughout the day. i couldn't sleep at night. for weeks. or when three of my classmates died. or when i was in a sexually abusive relationship for six months, got assaulted everyday on school grounds, and didn't tell anyone for eight months. i have flashbacks and awful dreams about *that* one to this day. but i don't say anything until someone asks me what's wrong. and even if they do, i'm reluctant to say so. bc none of this can be hugged better. it's heavy. it's uncomfortable and nobody wants to hear it. those are the only things that get to me. those are the things i go to therapy for. but my therapist doesn't believe in dwelling on (talking about) past traumas and griefs. i don't know what anyone wants me to do anymore. do i just let go of *everything*? i do not exagerrate; these things happened in the same twelve months. i'm not trying to excuse my complaints, but, yikes. i don't know what to make of any of this. anyway. tldr: nobody i open up to stick around. are all of these situations like. situations where both parties have made acceptable mistakes in handling their situation? or am i this unhappy person who makes people miserable because i complain so much? am i ungrateful? am i being crazy for saying the things i do? does anyone else hear statements like these from people who see you the most? it's times like these that makes self destructive behavior so easy."

bipolar,adhd,1320,"hey, so... after i graduated school, i had secured a very good and lucrative job. i moved to the city for the job, and i began working. well, because of some issues, unrelated to illness (surprisingly), i had to quit said job. i was lonely. i was bored. i started to just spiral. i maxed multiple credit cards. i've tried my darnedest to recoup some of the money via selling items on ebay, etc. but it just isn't enough. for example, there is literally no resale market for a limited edition, diamond-encrusted perfume bottle designed by a niche perfume house (spent $1200 on). i can't get back the money i spent on travel, either. i am sitting at probably $16,000 of debt via credit cards. however, it could be less. i'm not sure. shamefully, ir or college degree, and even that feels pointless, because all of the money will go toward paying off my debt. i've decided to force myself to go back to school to study medicine, but the logistics for that overwhelm me, given i just started this new job. i can't just quit. i need the money. i don't know if perhaps i should wait a year before returning to school, and spend time dedicated to working. i really don't know. i feel lost. i know i am smart enough and driven enough to go back to school; that isn't the concern. and i believe i have a good enough handle on my disorder to manage the schoolwork. i just worry that the timing is bad, given i'll be starting that new job... i don't really know what to do. if you read this, thank you."
depression,anxiety,1321,"i do this all the time. if i'm crushing on someone, my mind will usually be filled with a bunch of sappy romantic plot lines, that will never happen in real life lol"
depression,anxiety,1326,"i felt like this very often lately. it's terrifies me. i keep telling myself that this is all just in my head, but is it true? or is it merely a comforting thoungt i am desperately clinging to? (sorry for my terrible english.)"
depression,bipolar,1327,send me your energy pls. i don’t really care what happens but i’m proud to have done this and gotten to know someone like her. first time really putting myself out there since the start of my depressive episodes. i haven’t known her for long but since i’ve met her i have constant butterflies and i feel sick almost. i knew i didn’t really have a choice other than to try lol. if for no other reason to get some closurl stuff on this sub and thanks for the good energy :-) edit 2: hey friends she just responded like 15 hours later. she said it sounds fun and she still wanted to study later. she said she has an exam she needs to study for so she may not be able to go but all and all at least i didn’t get rejected! i’m ok with this result wish me luck guys. edit 3: i’m at the show alone and ok with it. thanks for the energy and all.
depression,ptsd,1337,"my 17 year old son committed suicide six months ago. it was frustrating for me to read the top thread here today. people did care. his friends cared. his dad, me and his two brothers cared. we supported him. we got him help. we listened. we hugged him a lot. i spent hours and hours in conversation with him. it wasn't a burden. he had a unique perspective and was wise beyond his years. he was never seen as a burden. we didn't patronize him. we didn't tell him stupid nonsense. we did our best to understand. when he was having a bad stly because we miss him so much but also our resulting trauma. even so, i hold no anger towards him. i still cry every day. so much of who i was, was tied to being his mom. i'm at sea as to what meaning and purpose i now have... anyway, i wrote this to mark the anniversary of the last time i looked into his beautiful blue eyes only to see the spark that made him a compassionate, intelligent, loving soul was gone. also, to dispel the idea that all suicides happen to people who were not loved and/or supported. thank you for reading."
ptsd,anxiety,1344,i've started to use cbd oil to manage my anxiety and i feel like a person again. i have energy to both accept any negative feelings i have and still put out a positivity to other people. which is something i struggle with when my anxiety is fully active since it pulls me down and it's difficult for me not to come off nasty when all my energy is spent fighting anxious thoughts and coping with the feelings it creates. i have an easier time talking myself down from my anxious thoughts and can function better in public in general. i can focus when i read and not forget things because i don't have my brain going a mile a minute. this stuff makes me feel like my life has changed drastically. i'm so grateful it exists.
anxiety,adhd,1347,"i mean, it’s pretty catch-all, hitting every note from personal catastrophic failure to an impending apocalypse. “well, it’d suck real bad if [blank] happened, but there’s always a rock to smash your own head in with!”"
adhd,anxiety,1354,"any time i manage to get to the doctor and get my prescription filled before i run out of pills i have this sense like i just dodged this enormous freight train of life mangling destruction. the pharmacy i use is attached to a grocery store so for some reason the i imagine the train dressed like strange danger and its waiting for me in the cookies isle. not much else to say, just felt like sharing."
bipolar,anxiety,1356,she's still an infant and i'm already worried that she knows that mommy is going through the motions some days. i try to keep doing our regular activities but it is so hard to smile and look and act enthusiastic. i'm just so tired and sad and i'm not sure i'm giving her what she needs. i'd love to hear your advice and experiences.
bipolar,anxiety,1370,"just feeling lonely lately, and haven't had any friends with this shared experience. i'm in my early twenties but am totally cool with friends from all walks of life. let's get dinner or drinks!"
depression,bipolar,1387,"i'm an 18(m) who has sporadic depressive episodes. i've told some of my friends both indirectly and explicitly. and i always regret it. i hate the way they feel like they are treading on thin ice around me, but then i clearly desire attention if i told them in the first place. i've tried saying it to close friends (mostly when drunk) and also tried using fairly obvious forms of art as well. whatever i do, whoever i talk to, i wish i just stayed on my own. probably going to end up regretting this aswell."
anxiety,depression,1391,"i think about death all the time. everything i do at this point i ask myself why? it won't matter when i'm dead. i keep thinking how i could die tonight, to tomorrow or in my 20's or in my 40's or just go into cardiac arrest before i finish posting this. what if i'm dead before this year ends? what if i'm dead before i meet a girl, or have kids, or hell what if i die before the next time i get to eat a steak or smoke a cigar. does anyone else have this? if so how do you cope? thanks. and sorry if i rambled."
bipolar,ptsd,1392,"do any of you have or had trouble taking responsibility for things? i'm 30 years old and feeling like i'm just now understanding my part in all the bad (and good) parts of my life. i recently realized how i treated my exes and the head games i played. i always thought ""head games"" we're intentional and this discovery has helped me forgive others because i don't think some of them meant to either. my last relationship had a lot of m i'm not diagnosed, i believe i have boarder line personality disorder. both of my more recent exes have told me i am abusive in my own ways (usually emotionally distant when needed but full on dependent during my own constant crises.) it's a damn shame i put so many men through hell without even taking their emotions seriously. anyway, those who share their problems with the blame game: do you have any suggestions? books? anything?"
bipolar,adhd,1396,medication has never worked for me. years of trial and error with different meds and different dosages has left me with no hope. i wonder what it’s like to have a brain that actually wants to live.
adhd,anxiety,1404,thank you to this [wonderful who went waaaay out of their way to try and hurt my feelings but ended up turning a bad day into a good one because it reminded me that some people have it worse. there are people out there who only feel good when they make others feel bad and those are the people to feel truly sorry for. i'm so flattered that they saw me as a target :)
ptsd,anxiety,1405,i'm sorry i can't think straight now and i'm panicking and shaking and i can't quit crying like a goddamn baby. i just looked up this sub now never been here before. my husband is always sneaking up on me and i guess it's an accident but i can't handle it. i had just screamed myself awake for the third time tonight/ this morning (and he knew it) when he entered a room right behind me while i had my back turned a split second and i turned and screamed moreking progress and the cops don't know where he is. i'm seriously thinking of putting bells on my husband or making a rule he has to call and get a response before entering a room. but dammit that sounds so disfunctional and i think he'd forget anyway but what do i do????? i've told him to sing or hum or talk to the cats as he moves through the house so i can hear him but most often he never does. what can i do? please help. edit: cause i didn't make sense
bipolar,adhd,1410,i don’t know if this is a common symptom with other people but i swear sometimes i feel like i mix up my words and i can’t talk right with my medication. does anyone else experience this?
adhd,anxiety,1412,"every time i get into an argument/ debate i’m either a second away from crying or a second away from an angry outburst. it’s so hard to keep my cool and as a result... i learned to stop talking/ people please/ avoid the topic whenever things got heated. it’s a bad habit. i know this. because it’s a bad habit i decided recently to slowly start facing my fear of arguments/disagreements and the pain is just coming right back. it’s overwhelming. every single attack feels personal. it is so hard to keep my cool, and when i do? i end up feeling like shit for the rest of the day because i feel like i’ve been rejected. everytime i feel rejected i suddenly think everyone is going to abandon me, and i get stuck in that feeling. i’m learning slowly and taking my time... but god does this shit suck!"
depression,anxiety,1413,"my best friend visited my city last weekend. i found out from a facebook post about how great it was seeing all his friends. 'had a great weekend thanks to all my london friends, see everyone in a few months!' shit man. when i get married he'll be my best man, and he didn't even think to text when he spent a weekend in my city."
ptsd,anxiety,1416,"the most i'm granted is the sick, gut churning nausea that nearly comes up but i force myself to swallow. i either feel sick, or nothing. i never truly sleep. and i wake up wishing i wouldn't. just needed to vent. thanks for listening."
bipolar,anxiety,1417,i've been struggling to rationalize myself right now. i have thoughts to hurt or kill myself. or walk for hundreds of miles. that my family and friends hate me that they are judging me and laughing behind my back. i feel like i constantly have to reassure myself that these perceptions aren't real. i have coursework i'm doing for an online course i really want to pass. i don't want to fail.fail.fail.fail.fail. i don't know how to control this my speech is being affected by this either too fast or slow and slurred. this anxiety has to stop now.
depression,bipolar,1418,"i'm on the long long road to recovery and the past few months have been comparitively really stable and happy for me. i don't cry nearly as often, i'm much more productive, and much more hopeful. but the second i do something wrong or encounter an issue, especially if someone's mad at me, i immediately jump back to thinking about suicide. it sends me into this spiraling panic that i'll never fix myself and be ok, until suicide feels like the way out. my mom was just screaming at me a lot yesterday and i was so close to just ending it right there, even though i know i don't really want to, and i know i'm gonna be in a better place in just over a month (going back to college)."
bipolar,adhd,1420,"my kitchen counters are always full of crap. half unpacked bags of groceries, 12 packs, bread products, clean dishes i didn't finish putting away, receipts, cookies, chips, you get the picture. well today i got the motivation to clean it off. now, i didn't clean clean the kitchen. my stove still has food stuck to it, floors need to be swept, sink is dirty, but i put all clean dishes away and sorted most of the clutter. that's a supom after i do some more grading. i did some grading today. is it the higher remeron dose kicking in? is it the tms working? is it the fact that i started taking a multivitamin, vitamin d, and b12? do i really care what it is? here it is, the middle of the night, i took the max dose of atarax/vistaril, and i'm still awake. shit. i would clean but i'm dizzy from the sleep meds. this is reminding me of when i was diagnosed before meds."
none,anxiety,1421,i heard the expression before and seems kinda understandable like it's am onomatopoeia or like it really has the feeling it tries to mean... it's like a shivery cringey thing as far as how i understand... could you please correct me if i'm wrong?
none,anxiety,1425,"my mother has had joint pain for quite sometime, and now it has escalated to a very different level where she can't even walk and she has been on the bed for past 6 months. i'm from a small towm called jamshedpur/ tatanagar and we have gone to almost every doctor and tried all their methods but no improvement has shown, infact by taking soo many high power medicinn really help her unlike the doctor's in my city.. so what places/hospital/finance schemes are my option? if the treatment to it is high we cannot afford it.... what to do guys. i'm really desperate and really i cannot see my mother suffer every minute of everyday... i tried to say this as openly as possible but i know i don't know the best words to describe it...."
anxiety,adhd,1426,"i'm having a really weird time right now. i'm going to preface this by saying i make significantly more than a lot of people, but i'm just learning to be responsible with it as of recently. in trying to save towards my goals (studying / teaching in japan) i found that it'd take me about 6 years to save up what'd it'd cost to do it. it's a lowish amount, about 20k, but i learned that my ceo males that in an hour the other day and it's been eating at me. i feel horrible because i just can't get the thought of my dreams and aspirations would take someone else an hour to achieve. just... yeah. sorry to rant. i'm down tonight. going to apply for a few more part time jobs. i hate being impatient like this."
depression,anxiety,1428,"you can cuss me out with insults, you can treat me like a subhuman, you can spit in my face, whatever. but please, please don't ignore me. i want my existence to be acknowledged. i want to be sure that i'm not just an invisible pair of eyes roaming around, witnessing everything happening without anybody noticing i'm there, like i'm an outsider looking in. please don't make me feel any more isolated than i already do, like i have no friends who genuinely care about me. i know i suck, and i know i fuck everything up frequently, and you're welcome to hurl expletives at me for it. i deserve it. but whatever you do, i'm begging you, *please* don't act like i'm not there at all."
ptsd,bipolar,1429,i've seen three different doctors and none of them will give me my meds. i'm literally getting to the point i will just buy the pills off the internet and risk going to prison just to function. they keep trying to tell me there are other meds that help that aren't addictive. why do they keep telling me this fucking lie and why the fuck do they believe it!!! i guess i'll just drink to function because that's what these people fucking want. i want to strangle these fucking doctors.
ptsd,anxiety,1434,"i know it's only september but i'm already feeling it, especially with halloween advertising everywhere already. usually go see in-laws but don't know if i can handle that at all this year...."
anxiety,depression,1438,i had a little numbness on my left side of my chest now im kinda bugging out while at work. and i cant stop thinking about it just want to know if thats normal for anyone. edit thank you all for your responses glad to know im not the only one feeling this way. i hope that you all can feel a little better.
none,anxiety,1439,"yesterday, after finishing my office work i left for home in my car. on the way i saw my neighbour walking on the footpath. i offered him a lift. he politely refused saying he is in a hurry."
anxiety,depression,1442,"so the title sums it up. i'm almost 28, all my friends are engaged, married or have a clatter of children. i have never even had a boyfriend in my life. i've had ""friend with benefits"" who in reality were not friends and have not benefitted me. i can see now i was used a practice girl before they moved onto women they actually care about. i have social anxiety and hate myself so expect others to hate me too. things like eye contact are very difficult. i use alcohol as a tool to try and be fun but it never really works out. not e first time in my life, he dumped me before i got that far. i'm not angry, i don't blame him, he just didn't feel the same way i do. it's left me absolutely broken. i believe im not good enough for anyone and don't see the point in going on anymore. i just go through the motions every day without feeling anything. i am on meds and see a doctor regularly but nothing helps. i tried counselling and could not talk. i have a history involving suicide and sexual assault and so trust is hard for me. i don't know where to go from here."
bipolar,anxiety,1443,things aren’t even that bad for me right now. last week was way worse. i’m doing okay at work keeping up with my to do list. i’m getting along with the family. for some reason i feel like i want to go to the hospital to get away from life. this is a feeling i’ve had many times. i always remind myself how much more comfortable my bed is in those moments. does anyone else have those thoughts?
ptsd,depression,1446,"almost pulled out of the gas station and hit someone. i didn't and stopped just in time. the driver gets out and starts yelling at me and i said i'm sorry. it was an honest mistake. i wasn't cutting him off or anything. now, i'm yelling and telling him to go, but he wont. he blocked me in. so i just lay't see it going well... i'm just not strong enough for this world. it's even just the little things. someone's tone of voice, body language or a way someone words something. im tired of walking around d on egg shells and taking all my strength to try to live a normal life. it's all just weighing me down."
bipolar,none,1447,"[my last so i asked for some useful website ideas i could build for our community here and i got a few awesome replies that i’ve taken under consideration. my main goal here is to build something that people (especially newcomers) will actually use. **i want it to be a place of happy, positive and organized information.** /u/fitsofthefather suggested building a section of medication and treatment related info that’s backed by research and studies. i want to hold off on that fidence boosting scripts that you can recite to yourself in times of need. it seems like a lot, but it’ll fit into one website. my only question is would it benefit this community and do you see it being useful? if so, i will need a few people to consult regarding information for the website and if anyone wants a place to blog you’re welcome to blog here! everything will be anonymous unless you want otherwise. thanks everyone. edit: thanks so much to /u/tosher23 for the gold!"
bipolar,anxiety,1448,"i was offered a full-time job recently and turned it down due to mental health concerns. time has passed, i've had time to consider things further, and my circumstances regarding treatment and therapy have changed. the hr rep who called me said that, if i change my mind about the position, all i have to do is reapply. openings are frequent. today i got notice of another opening and reapplied. i feel confident about taking this on at this point in my life. yes, a crap ton of stuff is going against me. but i feel like i can do this. for once, i'm taking that chance. as my best friend says, watch this space. it's about to get interesting."
depression,anxiety,1456,"you want certian people to always be there for you but they just can't be. they're busy and have their own lives. or maybe they just don't understand how much you're going through, or maybe they don't care too much. i don't know. i get really attached to people at times and constantly wish to be around them and talk to them. i just wish i had a best friend i guess. someone who constantly checked up on me and actually maybe showed concern for my well being. i just want to spend time with someone my age who actually also wants to hangout with me, and not just me wanting to hangout with them."

bipolar,depression,1473,"i was recently pming with someone about relationships, heartbreak, and feeling broken and picked up on a shared sentiment. that our mental illnesses made us less deserving of love from healthy people. which my rational mind tells me is total bullshit, but it's still a sentiment i have to put effort into rejecting. it's no secret i've been investing serious time into online dating, but i think it's progress on my part that most of the time i don't feel like my mental illness disqualifies me from relationships with healthy people. i still feel like i'll be better understood by people who experience depression and whatnot and like my issues will be less of a burden to someone with their own struggles for me to give back to, but as i was thinking abouto more broken than any ""normie."" *how many of you have struggled to feel like it's okay to have relationships with healthy people, and of those of you who have, what if anything has helped you chip away at that feeling?* as broken as i've felt and as flawed as i've been, i've never been broken and i've never stopped being worth loving. there have been things about me that have made it harder to love me, like my former bmi of nearly 40 as a barrier to that kind of attracted attention, but even then i was sometimes shown that kind of love. **however broken you may feel and however unlovable you may feel, you are most certainly mistaken. you are complete and just as flawed as everyone else and worthy of love, however hard it may be to find that love.**"
bipolar,adhd,1475,"lately i've been having this issue with how time passes. i don't seem to feel it pass. like it's ten thirty pm for me right now, and i don't feel like a day has passed. i haven't been doing anything absorbing where i haven't noticed time, it just feels like time doesn't happen. it's hard to explain. like i can set a timer for ten minutes and do nothing for those ten minutes, but have no feeling of waiting for ten minutes. it just goes off and i don't feel like that time has elapsed between setting it and the alarm. it's kind of a problem. i don't seem to realize that i'm wasting as much as i am because time doesn't register at all. has anyone else experienced this? is there anything i can do?"
depression,anxiety,1478,"it is such a cruel catch-22, how from within this condition of intense isolation, dread, and dysfunction, the nicest thing would be to have people around to talk to and be close to -- yet being afflicted by those things makes you an unattractive person to be around, and incapable of seeking out and making friends."
