bipolar,depression,2,"it's my 31st birthday i didn't care to do anything this year. the only reason i bought a cake is because i have a six year old. the only reason i'm posting is because... those younger than me: you'll be 31 one day, too. it gets better. you're worth every minute more of your life. i odied at 16 and struggled with suicidal ideations all throughout my twenties. i have an awesome kid. i decided to ask my fwb to be my bf yesterday and he said yes (wtf.) i am finally getting self discipline down and writing my books. i couldn't even imagine this all before. i've had the ups and downs but today, i am 31, and you'll get here one day, too."
ptsd,depression,13,"has any one found themselves isolated and lonely because they have trouble connecting to ppl? i only feel comfortable communicating with people who have some sort of serious mental health issue themselves as well, or are professionals in the field, thus very understanding. i am so tired of being lonely and limited in my abilities to make connections with people."
bipolar,none,19,"an ode to the dirge it's happening again. time has slowed by the tiniest of fractions all the infinite of paths have become slightly less infinite, and slightly less impossible impossibility is eroding...again yesterday's tasks, which seemed so heavy, so futile, so devoid of hope are now infused with the knowledge that all tasks are as light as you make them, as important as you deem them, and hoping that this feeling can stay it's happening again. time is reminding me that it can't cease to exist the click of time's tongue can change it's tone depending on how i choose to unwrap it's gifts like friendship, it can never leave you, it can never speed up, iut at our nothingness my ego claims the well-known eyes are kinder with their gaze, but it knows better they know better i know better. it's happening again. the arena of my mind changes with each breath, with each thought from challenge to shelter to prison to dead end my arena transforms until it doesn't until it's a step behind until it's steps behind it's happening again. my mind cannot keep up with my arena my arena will not keep up with my mind the clock ticks slower now until it doesn't. time is up. the focus is narrowed. the narrowed is focused. this is all gibberish nonsense...time has changed it all. impossibility is growing. it's happened again."
bipolar,anxiety,20,"""1) nothing makes you happy/all you do is complain/2) everytime we talk, there's conflict, so i'm anxious whenever we speak/ 3) every time you talk, you complain."" i'm afraid of being this unhappy person who pushes people away. anyone hear else? 3 long stories; tldr at the bottom. so in the title, within quotation marks, are what i've heard from people i spent the most time with. 1) my mom, 2) a now-ex boyfriend, and 3) a former friend. 1) my mom kinda blew up in the parking lot of a hospital. the doctor said i didn't need a cough pill for my infection, and would be fine with only the prescription she gave me, and then my mom asked if she could prescribe me with a cough syrup. the doctor agreed to prescribe a strong cough syrup, and i asked if i don't need a cough pill, ""do i need cough syrup?"" the doctor said no, but said ""the medicines won't react with one another,"" and ""if you want a cough syrup, i can prescribe one."" *but i don't.* my cough won't go away (respitory infection) until the steroids kick in, but it will go away. i don't like taking meds i don't need. i'm defensive about this, because every time i have respitory issues, my mom asks the doc for a cough syrup ""for my own good"" and i feel like shit bc it's got some depressive drug in it, and i feel ultra sluggish the morning after i take it. i don't need it so i'm adverse to taking it. my mom says it's ridiculous that i have a cough and won't take a cough syrup, when no cough syrup was prescribed or suggested. the steroids will take it's course. but mothers will be mothers. i just hate taking drugs i don't actually need. (and i'm 18 so i'd think the doctor would have asked me first. guess not.) anyway she called me ungrateful and wouldn't let me speak and i dunno. it hit me. she said: ""i'm better off dead than i am alive to you, because nothing i do as your mother makes you happy."" i wanted to shoot myself in the mouth right there and then, ngl. i know that isn't the (logical) answer to this, but she isn't the only one who's said stuff like this. 2) my ldr boyfriend of two years broke up with me last night. he says he doesn't feel like he can talk to me, because he says offhanded things, and for a while, i didn't address them until months later (which is toxic). and now he feels that he'll fuck up no matter what he does, so what's the point. in the past i've addressed things as they came up and he either made fun of me, got super defensive, or asked ""so what's the problem?"". for example: he didn't speak to me for long periods of time. for like. a year. cancelled majority of skype dates at the last second. i said that i knew he has other obligations, but that still felt a bit emotionally neglected. (being left on read for days and sometimes weeks, not hearing from him for months, reading an ""i love you, too"" from him was rare. i felt like he didn't like me.) but he said that i had no reason to believe that. he had a roommate who made me cry, and he didn't defend me. even if i say that i didn't appreciate a comment, he would just join him. of course, he didn't mean to be rude, and of course he didn't mean to overlook my crying, didn't mean to misunderstand me. but he refused to buy earbuds because of his ""indispoable income"" (even if he went out to drink once a month). which gave his roommate ammo to be a bully. so i mailed my then-bf earbuds and he lost them. it felt as if he didn't put any effort into the relationship, and was justifying himself. when i asked if he wanted to break up, he sounded surprised and confused as to why. said that he loves me. i wasn't angry, just hurt and confused with all the mixed messages. but i said i believed him and ignored my gut. plus, on holidays, he drives six hundred miles in one go to visit me (and his family. so contrary to what he says, i'm not the only reason he comes to the city i live in.) but he said ""you think i wanna see my family? barely anyone there wants to see me. i'md avoiding me, too. avoiding everyone. got in a real bad funk. said uncalled for comments to me and to other people. i understand how depression can be; but that doesn't excuse her from being mean. from playing rough and with scissors (as a seventeen year old). from going out of her way to patronize people. but she put on her snapchat story her suicidal thoughts, talking about how everyone she knows is against her. so i swiped up, let her know that i apologize if i wronged her, and that i want her to be okay. that i don't think anyone is against her. that i am here if she needs to talk. she said that i can't make her pity me, and i was baffled. that she doesn't have the energy for my bullshit. (yikes.) that i shouldn't play nice if i don't feel nicely about a person. (still don't know what's she was talking about but it was childish. but still yikes.) and then she said all i do is complain about my family problems and boyfriend and do nothing to fix it. (that was when i said ""good to know,"" and blocked her. hehe.) it's so funny that she *asked me* what's wrong, didn't accept ""nothing"" for an answer, and then secretly hated when i was open and honest. i thought she was my friend. but i guess only therapists are meant to hear your problems. anyway. i digress. days after i blocked her, she came around me in person. went out of her way to sit next to me. acted fearful, as if i would reject her. took every single chance she got to be overly nice. for example: i was presenting and the class (of 13 people) was talking over me. she stood up, cupped both hands over her mouth, and projected: ""everyone! chris is talking! it is important to hear what they say, so that they can finish their presentation!"" sat down, then grinned at me. the class had the same weirded-out expression as i did. like. ugh. that was so artificial that it hurt me. i have a floridan friend who i tell some of these situations with, and he says it sounds like the other person has some unsolved problems of their own. my therapist said the same thing about all three scenarios. that nothing i complain about is like. ""i'm so sad my dad got me a blue car. i wanted a red one."" y'know? like the problems that bother me are literally ""so i'm homeless and don't know where i'm sleeping tonight "" or ""i got 27 spider bites in my sleep"" or ""my mom is threatening to kick me out and i'm an unemployed student"" or something that can't be given advice, because it's totally out of anyone's control. like when my car got totalled and i kept having flashbacks about the crash throughout the day. i couldn't sleep at night. for weeks. or when three of my classmates died. or when i was in a sexually abusive relationship for six months, got assaulted everyday on school grounds, and didn't tell anyone for eight months. i have flashbacks and awful dreams about *that* one to this day. but i don't say anything until someone asks me what's wrong. and even if they do, i'm reluctant to say so. bc none of this can be hugged better. it's heavy. it's uncomfortable and nobody wants to hear it. those are the only things that get to me. those are the things i go to therapy for. but my therapist doesn't believe in dwelling on (talking about) past traumas and griefs. i don't know what anyone wants me to do anymore. do i just let go of *everything*? i do not exagerrate; these things happened in the same twelve months. i'm not trying to excuse my complaints, but, yikes. i don't know what to make of any of this. anyway. tldr: nobody i open up to stick around. are all of these situations like. situations where both parties have made acceptable mistakes in handling their situation? or am i this unhappy person who makes people miserable because i complain so much? am i ungrateful? am i being crazy for saying the things i do? does anyone else hear statements like these from people who see you the most? it's times like these that makes self destructive behavior so easy."
ptsd,depression,26,binge eating i eat my feelings. sometimes it's worse than others. at the moment i'm going through a bad patch and i cant stop the feeling of needing to eat. does anyone else go through this? i just want to feel less alone
anxiety,depression,32,"does anyone else find suicide comforting in the, “well, if it gets worse i can always kill myself” kind of way? i mean, it’s pretty catch-all, hitting every note from personal catastrophic failure to an impending apocalypse. “well, it’d suck real bad if [blank] happened, but there’s always a rock to smash your own head in with!”"
bipolar,ptsd,33,"social media? facebook seriously stresses me out. does anyone else struggle with social media? i have a hard time staying connected to friends and family because the things people post can be serious triggers for me. it doesn't matter if i'm upcycling or downcycling, something is bound to either agitate or depress me. sometimes i go on binges of unfollowing people. that doesn't help because then i don't have those connections and my feed fills up with promotede relationships. i have my immediate family, and a couple of close friends (that's funny. i haven't seen them in literally a year and a half) but everyone else is an acquaintance at best. i don't even talk to my mother unless i have to, and that's after we've mended our relationship (as much as possible at this point). i'm not asking for advice, i just want to know that i'm not alone in feeling like this. do others have the same experiences? can you share some?"
adhd,anxiety,38,"big middle finger to my pre med advisor and chemistry teacher who told me i wouldnt amount to anything because i couldnt pay attention in her course!! it's been five years but i just woke up from a nap re living the moment i was in her office when she told me. best advice she ever gave me was to leave pre med, which i did immediately after the meeting. never had to deal with her again but i still want to rub my resume in her face so she can see how very wrong she was and how far i went without her breathing down my neck."
bipolar,ptsd,48,"therapy during episodes. what do you do and is it helpful? so, how do handle therapy during episodes? last time i tried therapy i was in a mixed episode like the whole time, and you really could not convince me i was anything but the worst kind of person no matter what. cbt was useless, and i couldn't participate in mindfulness stuff either. it made me feel like i wasn't trying hard enough or therapy wasn't useful. i think i could make more progress outside of an episode. but, what kind of things do you do in therapy during one, and do you find it helpful at that time? i am going to try therapy again, and might need to discuss with my therapist at the start, like how i might have to adjust what we do depending on that."
adhd,anxiety,52,"so this is probably why we end up super awake at night and hate mornings we all hate waking up and end up getting super alert at night, right? turns out that norephinephrine (one of the major things we are short on because it needs dopamine to make) is probably part of that. it is the thing that helps us become alert, increases steadily through the day,d make us sleep when it should, *and* norephinephrine helps regulate blood sugar levels, so we're more likely to be hypoglycemic zombies when we wake up in the morning, so we're screwed from multiple directions. ~~yes i have been geeking out researching neurotransmitters, why do you ask? don't worry, i'll have found a new fixation in a few more days :d~~"
adhd,bipolar,56,"i accidentally took my meds at 10:00 at night. it's now 2:40 so tonight i was setting out my meds for tomorrow morning on my napkin while drinking a cup of water and i..... you guessed it...... took my meds. i tried to fall asleep fast so then i could sleep it off but that didn't work so here i am at like 2:40 on a monday morning. on the bright side i was able to write 1,000 words for an english paper i have due later this week. so yeah.... i have to wake up in 3 hours and 20 minutes and i am nowhere near tired. &amp;#x200b; tl;dr don't drink anything while setting out your meds my guy"
adhd,depression,72,"wasted days am i the only one that waste days effortlessly? like, i can plan a whole day but never do anything. i cycle through snap, ig, and youtube and get nothing done. when i do get urges to do something it’s 2/3 am but that would waste my mornings. so what do i do? i legit can’t get anything done and i hate it. people i care about look down on me and i feel worthless. i know people move at different paces to reach like goals but i don’t feel like i’m moving if i do absolutely nothing."
bipolar,depression,77,"first try at spoken word writing... last week i wore my hair up everyday to work. not because i particularly like the way it looks, but because i couldn’t will myself the effort to take a shower for 5 days. wearing my “depression” hoodie that is 3 sizes too big, just so i can ignore my weight issue and have it’s dog hair covered fabric drape around my already dirty pajama shirt that i wore the last 4 nights. being this kind of sad is funny that way even something as mundane and rudimentary as doing my lke a ball of glitter about to explode taking shots at the bar with my friends and oversharing too much with too many people this happiness turns agitated and irritable every small inconvenience feels like i might just turn green, sprout some brown shorts and call myself hulk like a rubber band that is twisting tighter and tighter until it snaps. and cuts my arm with an exacto knife and down i fall again… when people ask me how i am they should just ask me who i am today and what does my laundry look like"
bipolar,anxiety,78,"i slipped hi all, this is very embarrassing but 6 months ago i stopped my meds and stopped seeing my psychiatrist without warning and without saying anything. at the time i was increasing my usuage of marijuana and i felt that i was given the wrong diagnosis. i was on seroquel wellbutrin and depakote. i stopped myself gradually without doctor supervision. since then nothing has got better. my anger and anxiety increased. my suspiciousness, delusions, and paranoia are returning. ive been sort of suicidal and haven't been able to get out of bed or leave my house. all i do is smoke weed - which i feel is a half assed attempt to self medicate (i've gotten really good at feeding myself excuses). does anyone have any experiences returning to treatment. i know i'm not going to be heavily judged for returning but something is stopping me (possible to rudeness of leaving treatment last time) should i get a 2nd opinion? what should i do i can't live like this anymore."
adhd,anxiety,87,"got my prescription filled any time i manage to get to the doctor and get my prescription filled before i run out of pills i have this sense like i just dodged this enormous freight train of life mangling destruction. the pharmacy i use is attached to a grocery store so for some reason the i imagine the train dressed like strange danger and its waiting for me in the cookies isle. not much else to say, just felt like sharing."

(this is not an advertisement, juh me so it's like my own private showing. so maybe if you're like me and love movies, a subscription service may be the thing to help you leave the house. amc theaters also has a subscription service for $20 a month if you can afford that. (this is in the us). sinema has plans starting at $4.99 a month. if you love movies and want to have a motivation to leave the house once in a while, this may be a good idea for you."
adhd,none,226,"people are jealous of my accommodations, they don’t understand how deprecating it can be. people are like “oh you get extra time on the test? the math teacher makes you do only half the homework? so lucky!!” no. it makes me feel special. i don’t want to be special. to be so bad at something that you’re an exception to the rules? it makes you feel like shit."

adhd,anxiety,238,not wanting to be a problem sometimes makes things worse. was anyone else reminded of what a burden and a distraction they were to the point that now they go to moronic lengths not to inconvenience anyone? i often do this and it always makes things worse. any coping strategies?
none,anxiety,241,"whats a nicer way to say ""you shouldnt worry about my marks, just focus on your own"" maybe this way of saying it is fine, but when people ask around and compare test scores, i genuinely believe and want to tell people that they shouldn't focus on what other people scored but focus on themselves and their own work. i don't want to sound too formal or even rude since i am a student. so how should i reply to people asking whatever test mark i received?"

adhd,anxiety,253,"lmao i just remembered why i don't ask question in class anymore so i had this professor who always used to say ""never be afraid to make me repeat myself. i'll repeat as many times as necessary"". he used to say it so much that i really did think he'd be cool with it, cause i did want him to repeat a lot of times because i wasn't able to pay attention and tended to zone-out while he was teaching. so i started asking him to repeat himself, a few times in the entire class, until he told me not do it anymore cause he thought i was a troll. he also then stopped saying anyone could repeat him."

bipolar,anxiety,278,"was diagnosed yesterday as type ii, and now things make sense, but are also scary? so i have known for a long time i have suffered from depression and anxiety. i mean if you check my posts history you can see that. i find myself frequently depressed, to the point of wanting to just end things (however won't for a myriad of reasons). i also find myself anxious beyond belief about certain things. i was told for years that i had both depression and anxiety. nothing more, nothing less. i have had manic episodes, and when i am on go, i am on go, but i am good at looking stoic and hologist has never sat me down and given me exams or anything but has suggested it for years. my therapist even was on the boarder about it for a while. i am sure my mom has it too, albeit far more showing? so yeah, here we are! rather here i am in my early 30s and finally things click. however, it is scary. like i don't know what comes next? will this diagnosis impact my life negatively and adversely? will i have to disclose it, or hide it from my job? i don't know. it is ironically depressing in of it self. but we shall see what the future holds. anyway, thanks for reading!"

depression,anxiety,306,"anyone get annoyed by the people that 'advocate' talking about mental health but never practice what they preach? i'm talking about the kind of people who'd say ""talk to someone"" but would happily ignore you when trying to talk about it to them. this leads to feeling annoyed at yourself for bothering them and then bottling everything up and not talking to anyone about it."

ptsd,anxiety,333,cbd oil feels like a miracle i've started to use cbd oil to manage my anxiety and i feel like a person again. i have energy to both accept any negative feelings i have and still put out a positivity to other people. which is something i struggle with when my anxiety is fully active since it pulls me down and it's difficult for me not to come off nasty when all my energy is spent fighting anxious thoughts and coping with the feelings it creates. i have an easier time talking myself down from my anxious thoughts and can function better in public in general. i can focus when i read and not forget things because i don't have my brain going a mile a minute. this stuff makes me feel like my life has changed drastically. i'm so grateful it exists.

depression,bipolar,483,"if you feel shitty, help someone else not feel shitty. kinda shitty advice. but i'll start with some backstory. i'm on mobile so forgive me. (this will be kinda rambly) i was diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety disorder after i checked into a psychiatric hospital a few years back, but i always felt as i grew up that something was wrong. when i went to go meet my biological mother (who is very bipolar) when i was 18 things started to click with me that i needed to figure out a way to find meaning. it didn't help that my step-mom was an abusive cunt. so overall i kinda suck at being a person.(still do) anyways, i've struggled with constantly feeling down, and also feeling a whole lotta shit i didn't really understand. because of this i turned to weed and alcohol when i was 15. went through a few phases of drinking hard, but really weed was my poison of choice(still dont think it's bad but that's for another sub). again anyways because of the plant i kinda regained a sense of what it meant to be a healthy funcnt know how we'll pay the rent, things get complicated with family, with work, with life. and all of it together makes me wanna opt out. but then i think of leaving him by himself to deal with it himself and what a living hell that would be. even if i cant do much, ill do what i can till i can't. because if i dont that would make me sadder than anything i can ever encounter in my life. my point is that out there there are strong, amazing, incredibly intelligent and driven people, who do this shit alone. while feeling everything. and its heart breaking. my dad spent his life trying to make me feel welcome when every fiber of my being says i don't belong on this earth. the least i can do is gtfo bed and try to do something. even if my battle that day is just to brush my teeth. so that he can see a good looking smile that he made. to make him feel just a little better. that's my part, my mission. thats what gets me up. there are people that can use your help, and you owe it to them. but that s just my opinion."

adhd,bipolar,805,"31 years old. just started taking ritalin 4 days ago. my lsat score jumped 15 points overnight, and i'm now competitive at the best schools in country. i'm over the moon excited right now. crying. i took a practice lsat this morning after starting ritalin on saturday. i went from a score of 157 (~70th percentile) to 172 (~99th percentile) because i took a pill. that puts me squarely within striking distance of harvard, yale, stanford and columbia. i think with a few weeks practice, i could be testing at 175+, putting me above the median scores for all of those schools. getting this diagnosis is like waking up from a miserable dream. i've known so long i was very capable, but i just didn't seem to be able to get the power to the road. i started to think i was just delusional, and that this feeling that i could be doing so much more was just a sign of entitlement and arrogance. sons people have trouble fulfilling their potential, and it's unraveled this insipid american myth that i had grown up believing that people get what they deserve, that hard work conquers all. if had been born 50 years ago, i'd probably be on track to drug abuse and an early death. i've become much more sympathetic to systemic injustice and inequality and more forgiving of everyone around me. my heart has grown exponentially through all of this. maybe now i'll be able to put that goodness to good use. adhd doesn't mean you're stupid. and it's so fucking real. anyone who tells you otherwise is ignorant or a moron or both. fuck 'em. you're all amazing here. the fact that any of you are alive and haven't given up makes you heroes in my book. and let this be a reminder to get more help if you're feeling like you can't manage. it's not your fault. there is help out there. god bless."

adhd,anxiety,1243,"what learned helplessness is like just in case anyone isn't aware of what learned helplessness feels like, and as a warning to people not to keep trying the same thing over and over, i've written the following. i will use the term ""brain"" to refer to the unconscious, impulsive parts of the brain, the parts that aren't ""you"", and ""you"" to refer to your conscious experience and rational brain. (disclaimer, this is only my experience, i don't know what other people's experiences are.) --- imagine walking around, going through life, except you don't decide what you do. your brain decides everything for you and you have no say. it wants to play video games, so you play video games. that isn't to say you don't fight it, but on those occasions that you do you either are simply unable to do anything, or every frustration with yourself for every past failure floods upon you, washing your willpower away in a tidal wave of anxiety. you quickly learn the only way to fight is to not fight at all. --- now, imagine somebody calmly tells you, ""i know it's hard, but you really need to just get up and do it. i have no magic bullet unfortunately."" this is nice, they know that you have a hard time ""just doing it"" but at this point there's no way around it, it just needs to be done. you wholeheartedly agree with them, and feel like the ultimate solution _is_ to ""just do it"". your brain however immediately reminds you how ""it's never worked before, so why will it work now?"" this isn't just a small voice, it is backed by the combined anxiety of every failure and inadequacy you have ever had. --- i'll attempt to explain what lies behind this sense of hopelessness: this sense of hopelessness, in its simplest form, is the feeling that ""it's never worked, so why would it change?"" however, it goes deeper than that. the following is the main thought process: - according to other people you just need to try hard enough to solve the problem - you feel ""i just don't care anymore"" ( ditto ) - ""i hate myself"" (when i metaphorically close my eyes, cover my ears, and run from what i need to do yelling ""lalalalalalalala"", also when i am sitting doing something i enjoy and remember what i'm supposed to be doing) - ""i just can't."" (when i try to calm myself or when i'm lying in a fetal position on the bed, spiraling deeper into depression) - ""i just want the world to go away"" (this feeling makes me realize why some people kill themselves. i fortunately just retreat to my bed or some form of entertainment that allows my brain to shut off temporarily) --- i'm not saying this is permanent problem, or that there aren't any solutions, just that it's incredibly difficult, more difficult than i feel most anyone can imagine. it's the torture of hopelessness, with the frustration of fully knowing with your rational brain that hope itself is all that is needed to solve the problem, yet finding that hope hopelessly far away. please, everyone. think before you tell someone to ""just try."" they may have forgotten how to. --- edit: some people may say that you just need to build in systems, and i agree that that is a good solution, but at least for me, i've tried so many of my own systems that even trying to talk with it causes my brain to lock up with anxiety. likely because it forces me to confront all my past failures, which further discourages me from trying. i'd still love to hear any advice people have though. --- tl;dr; learned helplessness isn't thinking you are helpless, it is feeling that you've forgotten how to try. if you really wanted to try it would have worked, since people say to just try, so you must not really _want_ to try, so you begin to instead want to want to try. in addition, confronting it in any way brings with it all the anxiety of every past failure, meaning that often, instead of doing something you often fail to do you just close your eyes and hope it'll go away."

adhd,depression,1339,"i cleaned my room and holy shit! sorry, this is long. so, just like the title says, i cleaned my room yesterday. i mean, i really cleaned it. it was disorganized and always messy and it had been driving me nuts for probably a year. i made a deal with my husband that every saturday we would choose one area of the house and purge it and really scrub it. we've lived in our house for 6years and we neaten it here and there, clean it up better when company comes, but we've never really gone room by room and sorted everything and purged all the old stuff and scrubbed the corners and walls and stuff. so this is pretty embarrassing, but i normally use natural cleaners for everything except the toilet and i've never really scrubbed everything hard- just surface cleaning here and there to get it a step above unsanitary and gross. yesterday i broke out the big guns and used an entire brand new can of scrubbing bubbles just on my makeup counter and toilet/shower area (our house was built in the 70's and our sink is in our bedroom opposite another counter vanity for make up, and the toilet and shower are in a tiny little room with a pocket door). you guys, i dusted everything, scrubbed the window frames, washed the windows, cleaned our lampshades inside and out including the bulbs. i scrubbed all the baseboards, washed and reorganized my medicine cabinet shelves e're each tackling their bedrooms. little by little we're going to make our way through the whole house and de-clutter and organize it. it's such a daunting task, but just knowing how good it feels to get it done is huge motivation! i'm also trying to not berate myself for letting it get so bad. cleaning is probably my least favorite activity ever, but i feel so good when things are picked up and cleaned. i know it's better for my mental health and feeling in control, too. more motivation to get rid of a lot of extra crap taking up room in my life! tl;dr-cleaned my room and it was much worse than i'd realized. motivated to keep the momentum going and get the rest of the house in order. edit:: i thought i should give an update! it has been three weeks and my room is still clean! i can't even believe it, but it is!!! dh and i both also clean all three of our kids rooms and i cleared up a lot of launfry today. i can't even begin to tell you how motivating it is to get this done. i think i've reached a point where i actually want to clean things up because of how nice it feels! we still have some pretty major sections of the house to work our way through and it will be a chore to get the kids to be more cognizant of their rooms, but after three saturdays of committing to this it feels like i'm almost at the stage of making it a new normal! *happy dance!*"

adhd,none,1423,"13 hours later, got 100% on math test. been having a terribly hard time with this math class and on my last module for the semester and i have 2 weeks to complete it. i sat down yesterday and grinded my pen against my notebook studying retaking the pretest over and over i think i have 25 attempts down right now, making sure i understood the problems and formulas. took both of my adderall yesterday and put 1 song on repeat for 2 hours then despite my add. i just thought i would share a bit of success on my end and hopefully give a bit of hope to others here. i know the struggle of getting sucked into distraction and not wanting to do homework or anything mentally taxing. even though it required a ton of discipline, i got it to work. i hope you guys have a good week, we all deserve what we want, even if it does require us to work a bit harder than others. you guys are awesome!"
adhd,bipolar,1425,"i just want to say thank you to all of the subscribers of this subreddit. as emotional as it sounds, i never felt understood until i found you guys. seriously. i never realized other people struggled with as many of the same things that i struggle with. finding this community helped me realize that i'm not alone, and helped me better understand my mental illness. i am so grateful."
adhd,depression,1428,"i wish i could just grab all of you and move to another planet i see your, our, struggle. evolution made us this way for a reason. we have a purpose. but it's really fucking hard to find that in this fucked up modern society. imagine. lots of nature(yes the planet has nature). a brand new start. let everyone be free from the wrong kind of responsibilty. let everyone gravitate towards their natural talents and skills, let people be passionate. no schedule. no shaming of bad structure or organisation. ok maybe bring a handful of neurotypicals for the paperwork. yeah i'm in total denial of the world we actually live in. too painful to face the truth."
bipolar,ptsd,1431,"what do you wish you could have told your newly diagnosed self? travel back in time to when you first received your diagnosis. what would you tell your former self about the disease, coping mechanisms, relationships (romantic and not), therapy, etc. what do you wish you had known? what do you wish someone had told you?"
adhd,depression,1432,"tonight i got ready for tomorrow morning i'll try to keep it short for you guys and myself, but i wanted to share my accomplishment with somebody who would get it. tonight i didn't play just ""1 more"" round of overwatch, tonight i didn't watch ""just 1 more episode before going to bed"", and i didn't just say ""i hope i actually get up and get ready on time tomorrow."" tonight, i shut everything off, i brushed my teeth, took my contacts out, and laid out my clothes for tomorrow. hell yeah. i'm off reddit for the night after submitting this, but thanks for reading."
bipolar,depression,1443,"finally put a couple good days together - this sub has really helped i just want to thank all the great people out there i have “met” the past few days. i felt such a sense of loneliness, and this sub has given me renewed self worth. i have positive influences in my life, but never had people to talk to who live with this diagnosis. reading your posts, replying to them, getting feedback, gaining understanding, etc. i hope this string of good days continues. i hope the rest of you out there are putting some good days together as well, and if you are not, know you have a friend who is ready to listen. thanks again!"
bipolar,adhd,1449,"wooooo i did it! so i have been working my ass off the past 2 1/2 years to get my head back together and take a bunch of classes i needed for education endorsements so i could get into masters in teaching program. i just found out i got into the program!!! wooo i'm going to grad school! 3 years ago i could barely get out of bed, this spring i'll be learning to teach at an excellent school and i just felt like sharing with people who would get how big of a deal this is to me. i am so happy."
depression,adhd,1452,"i showered today. it took almost 2 hours to get out of bed, and i cried the whole time i was in there, but i showered. i actually washed my hair and stuff too. super late edit: thank you to everyone who responded. i am still doing ok- my hometown had some nasty storms and it knocked out the internet for quite some time. we had power, just a backlog of people demanding expedient customer service from america's worst customer service provider/cable &amp; internet provider (you kno, but there have been a few days that, now that spring has sprung, i decided to give myself a project. i will be upgrading my back yard into a beautiful garden. the flowers and the sun, i think, will do me a lot of good. on good days i can work outside and on bad days i can browse pintrest and reddit for new ideas. this is the most excited, the most anything i've been in a long time. and it started with your support and a simple shower. you're all so wonderful, thank you so much."
depression,bipolar,1456,"why is everything so fucking hard now that i've struggles with this bullshit for 7 years, i've come to the realisation that literally no one cares no one is genuinely there for you. everyone will claim to be there for you and beg you to open up to them because they want to be the hero who 'saves' you from your mental illness, but they're thinking of a glamourised, coming of age mental illness no one wants to deal with the reality - not getting out of bed for 3 days straight and then finally getting up and not showering or brushing your teeth because you don't have the energy to. deleting your social medias and ignoring texts for days on end because you just can't quite bring yourself to talk to people. going through days of mania followed by weeks of lowness and having people expect you to be okay because of those few days of mania everyone wants to be there for you until you actually show symptoms"
bipolar,ptsd,1471,do you guys get nightmares? i had the worst one of my life tonight. i was psychotic and had a flashback to my attempt. multiple times. my hand was talking to me and telling me bad things. i have 3-4 nightmares a week and they aren't getting better. i don't know why this is happening.
ptsd,depression,1482,"i hate everything i hate this disorder, i hate the people who did this to me, i hate the holidays, i hate knowing that no one is ever really going to actually care. when it comes down to it they just really don't. if i have to be so fucking lonely with this pain then i would rather just actually be alone then. i hate all of this."
