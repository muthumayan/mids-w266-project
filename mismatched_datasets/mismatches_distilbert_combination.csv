adhd,anxiety,125,"people sceptical of my diagnosis because i'm ""successful"" apologies for long post / first post awkwardness. i was diagnosed about a month ago after going to several doctors about my struggles. the first doctor dismissed me because ""i didn't fail in school"". the second said i was just distracted by my own anxiety. finally went to a psychiatrist who clocked add right away, paired with generalised anxiety disorder. the reactions of friends and family have been sceptical at best, and their main comment is ""but you've always done so well."" yes, from the outside i'm not a failure: * passed school * got a four year degree * got a job and got promoted * now self employed as a consultant the truth is, even though i was so desperate for a d **does everyone get an identity crisis when they get diagnosed?** do you find you have to retell your life story to people - with the ugly parts you never shared before - so that they get it? i also feel a little cheated because i'm 28 and have spent a lot of my adult life reading self-help books, trying to accept and love myself as i am. only to discover that things i've fought so hard to love about myself (like being overweight) are a legit by-product of messed up chemistry in my brain (i'm now losing weight effortlessly since starting concerta, because i'm not impulsively eating &amp; obsessing about food.) **tl;dr recently diagnosed, people don't believe me because i've never let myself fail in public. anyone else like this?**"
bipolar,adhd,133,"thanks dad, it's always nice to be reminded i'm a failure. [rant] [long] i gotta vent. dad, you've been giving mixed compliments for the past week. backhanded praise and shit. ""i don't care if you fail, i care if you try."" too fucking bad dad, i care more if i fail than if i try, and i get that that doesn't get me anywhere; it feels pretty shitty to be reminded my ridiculous rejection sensitivity makes me a terrible person. fine, impedes my success. you didn't call me a terrible person. but that's what i'm getting at. the rejection sensitivity. what amounted to ""your not trying for the sake of avoiding getting hurt disappoints and irritates me"" turned into ""you're a terrible person."" or maybe i took it to mean ""you're broken."" i often think i am. how do you think it feels when i submit 10 job applications and my brain does the same thing about not hearing back? how do you think it feels to be constantly looking at jobs trying to balance what i'm qualified for, what won't be soul-crushingly mind-numbing, and what will actually move me forward in life? and then after beating myself up to get myself to start and continue that process, getting discouraged either not hearing back or hearing i didn't get the job. and then there of performing work and am now telling myself ""you're gonna be the lazy drug using social security beneficiary nobody wants to get their money"" while i tell myself i don't deserve it because i feel like a liar. but you know what? it may hurt, **but i take it on for you**. because i acknowledge my debilitating fear of trying on the job front and would rather take on shame than let my failure to launch weigh you down. when i was growing up, i used to tell myself ""no one can hurt you more than your own family."" i think that's still true for me today. thanks dad. *do you know why i changed therapists after you got your cancer diagnosis?* **i wanted to make sure you'd be proud of me before you died.** i sure as hell don't feel like you are right now. tl;dr: my dad hurt me and pissed me off by telling me he doesn't feel like i try and expressing frustration at how much time i put into videogames (where i can at least feel successful at **something**) when i spent less time on videogames today than half of what i spend most days in general. seriously, videogaming and weight loss are the only two things i've succeeded at since graduation. maybe not dying, too, but i don't think that should count. good to know i'm a disappointment."
ptsd,bipolar,134,"i hate it when people treat it like i‚Äôm having a tantrum it‚Äôs so invalidating and patronizing. i‚Äôm a goddamn adult i have a job and pay taxes, if i don‚Äôt want to hear you say his name or talk about him so casually when you don‚Äôt think i‚Äôm listening then buck the fuck up and learn a little respect."

anxiety,depression,651,"i'm pathetic... i'm 25, no friends, living with my parents, struggling to finish school - i feel like i don't have any coping mechanisms anymore? anyone been here at my age? the older i get, the worse i seem to be at, i don't know, functioning in general. i used to be really sociable, have plenty of friends, i did well in school, had hobbies and interests - i was weird, but enough people liked me that i didn't think about it. after high school it was like the blinders were taken off and i started to see all these things about myself that i really, really hated. i started struggling a lot in social situations, i flunked out of a really good university, i couldn't hold a job, i gradually lost contact with my friends... i was a mess. don't see how to salvage any of that from what i've let myself become. i think a big part of my problems is that i'm so used to trying and failing that i'm afraid that's the only outcome if i try again. i look at myself and think ""i've given up,"" because i have. i don't want to! but i don't know how to make life work for me anymore. i don't know how to connect with people. i go out somewhere and it's impossible to think or talk clearly through the static in my head that makes me nauseous and stutter and my heart pound. what kind of a life is one where you can't even talk to someone without turning into an idiot or crying after? i can't function like this. i'll never be able to work like this. has anyone overcome a similar situation?"

anxiety,depression,697,"does anyone else hate the phrase ""man up or toughen up""? like i hate it for two reasons because first of all it either emasculating or infantilising. and second it implies that im not doing my best or at the least not trying or sometimes it comes off as someone making light of my feelings."
ptsd,anxiety,709,"feeling like there is a sign on my face that says ""vulnerable"" on hard days, like today, it is hard to go out and talk to people, or even trust them per se. it's hard to explain, but i've had difficulties setting boundaries in the past that resulted in trauma. it's hard for me to be direct on bad days, for example, because i experience a lot of anxiety. today, i had to go to the mechanic to get a quick check up. i was already feeling nervous, and got a weird vibe from the mechanic. he started to ask me personal questions, like where i came from (just moved from another city), my job, etc. perfectly fine, but i wasn't overly friendly because my needs were that i wanted it to be over soon. afterward, he proceeded to give me unwarranted advice about my life, (""don't let people hurt you here"" he said), ask me more about my personal life, then tried to fill up my car tires and other things without asking.  afterward, and this was weird. it made me feel like i couldn't stand up for myself. even though i did by telling him i needed to go, i feel guilty now. this is the same feeling i had in the past when i felt like people used this guilt to coerce me into sex. it's hard because in a way it is my fault for not having better boundaries. i just want to feel safe when i go out, but the world is not safe. for ptsd folks, it feels even less so. tl/dr - what do you do to protect yourself against unwarranted advances, toxicity, things like that? especially as a vulnerable woman who is still learning assertiveness. edit: so i looked at yelp reviews and they confirmed my feelings. here are some: ""owner preys on the innocent."" ""owner is a disrespectful grump."" ""so rude."" ""be careful."" ""stay away."" things like that. i think i validated myself, but still need to stop blaming myself for the creepy behaviors of others."

adhd,depression,1075,"what learned helplessness is like just in case anyone isn't aware of what learned helplessness feels like, and as a warning to people not to keep trying the same thing over and over, i've written the following. i will use the term ""brain"" to refer to the unconscious, impulsive parts of the brain, the parts that aren't ""you"", and ""you"" to refer to your conscious experience and rational brain. (disclaimer, this is only my experience, i don't know what other people's experiences are.) --- imagine walking around, going through life, except you don't decide what you do. your brain decides everything for you and you have no say. it wants to play video games, so you play video games. that isn't to say you don't fight it, but on those occasions that you do you either are simply unable to do anything, or every frustration with yourself for every past failure floods upon you, washing your willpower away in a tidal wave of anxiety. you quickly learn the only way to fight is to not fight at all. --- now, imagine somebody calmly tells you, ""i know it's hard, but you really need to just get up and do it. i have no magic bullet unfortunately."" this is nice, they know that you have a hard time ""just doing it"" but at this point there's no way around it, it just needs to be done. you wholeheartedly agree with them, and feel like the ultimate solution _is_ to ""just do it"". your brain however immediately reminds you how ""it's never worked before, so why will it work now?"" this isn't just a small voice, it is backed by the combined anxiety of every failure and inadequacy you have ever had. --- i'll attempt to explain what lies behind this sense of hopelessness: this sense of hopelessness, in its simplest form, is the feeling that ""it's never worked, so why would it change?"" however, it goes deeper than that. the following is the main thought process: - according to other people you just need to try hard enough to solve the problem - you feel ""i just don't care anymore"" ( ditto ) - ""i hate myself"" (when i metaphorically close my eyes, cover my ears, and run from what i need to do yelling ""lalalalalalalala"", also when i am sitting doing something i enjoy and remember what i'm supposed to be doing) - ""i just can't."" (when i try to calm myself or when i'm lying in a fetal position on the bed, spiraling deeper into depression) - ""i just want the world to go away"" (this feeling makes me realize why some people kill themselves. i fortunately just retreat to my bed or some form of entertainment that allows my brain to shut off temporarily) --- i'm not saying this is permanent problem, or that there aren't any solutions, just that it's incredibly difficult, more difficult than i feel most anyone can imagine. it's the torture of hopelessness, with the frustration of fully knowing with your rational brain that hope itself is all that is needed to solve the problem, yet finding that hope hopelessly far away. please, everyone. think before you tell someone to ""just try."" they may have forgotten how to. --- edit: some people may say that you just need to build in systems, and i agree that that is a good solution, but at least for me, i've tried so many of my own systems that even trying to talk with it causes my brain to lock up with anxiety. likely because it forces me to confront all my past failures, which further discourages me from trying. i'd still love to hear any advice people have though. --- tl;dr; learned helplessness isn't thinking you are helpless, it is feeling that you've forgotten how to try. if you really wanted to try it would have worked, since people say to just try, so you must not really _want_ to try, so you begin to instead want to want to try. in addition, confronting it in any way brings with it all the anxiety of every past failure, meaning that often, instead of doing something you often fail to do you just close your eyes and hope it'll go away."

bipolar,anxiety,1205,"""1) nothing makes you happy/all you do is complain/2) everytime we talk, there's conflict, so i'm anxious whenever we speak/ 3) every time you talk, you complain."" i'm afraid of being this unhappy person who pushes people away. anyone hear else? 3 long stories; tldr at the bottom. so in the title, within quotation marks, are what i've heard from people i spent the most time with. 1) my mom, 2) a now-ex boyfriend, and 3) a former friend. 1) my mom kinda blew up in the parking lot of a hospital. the doctor said i didn't need a cough pill for my infection, and would be fine with only the prescription she gave me, and then my mom asked if she could prescribe me with a cough syrup. the doctor agreed to prescribe a strong cough syrup, and i asked if i don't need a cough pill, ""do i need cough syrup?"" the doctor said no, but said ""the medicines won't react with one another,"" and ""if you want a cough syrup, i can prescribe one."" *but i don't.* my cough won't go away (respitory infection) until the steroids kick in, but it will go away. i don't like taking meds i don't need. i'm defensive about this, because every time i have respitory issues, my mom asks the doc for a cough syrup ""for my own good"" and i feel like shit bc it's got some depressive drug in it, and i feel ultra sluggish the morning after i take it. i don't need it so i'm adverse to taking it. my mom says it's ridiculous that i have a cough and won't take a cough syrup, when no cough syrup was prescribed or suggested. the steroids will take it's course. but mothers will be mothers. i just hate taking drugs i don't actually need. (and i'm 18 so i'd think the doctor would have asked me first. guess not.) anyway she called me ungrateful and wouldn't let me speak and i dunno. it hit me. she said: ""i'm better off dead than i am alive to you, because nothing i do as your mother makes you happy."" i wanted to shoot myself in the mouth right there and then, ngl. i know that isn't the (logical) answer to this, but she isn't the only one who's said stuff like this. 2) my ldr boyfriend of two years broke up with me last night. he says he doesn't feel like he can talk to me, because he says offhanded things, and for a while, i didn't address them until months later (which is toxic). and now he feels that he'll fuck up no matter what he does, so what's the point. in the past i've addressed things as they came up and he either made fun of me, got super defensive, or asked ""so what's the problem?"". for example: he didn't speak to me for long periods of time. for like. a year. cancelled majority of skype dates at the last second. i said that i knew he has other obligations, but that still felt a bit emotionally neglected. (being left on read for days and sometimes weeks, not hearing from him for months, reading an ""i love you, too"" from him was rare. i felt like he didn't like me.) but he said that i had no reason to believe that. he had a roommate who made me cry, and he didn't defend me. even if i say that i didn't appreciate a comment, he would just join him. of course, he didn't mean to be rude, and of course he didn't mean to overlook my crying, didn't mean to misunderstand me. but he refused to buy earbuds because of his ""indispoable income"" (even if he went out to drink once a month). which gave his roommate ammo to be a bully. so i mailed my then-bf earbuds and he lost them. it felt as if he didn't put any effort into the relationship, and was justifying himself. when i asked if he wanted to break up, he sounded surprised and confused as to why. said that he loves me. i wasn't angry, just hurt and confused with all the mixed messages. but i said i believed him and ignored my gut. plus, on holidays, he drives six hundred miles in one go to visit me (and his family. so contrary to what he says, i'm not the only reason he comes to the city i live in.) but he said ""you think i wanna see my family? barely anyone there wants to see me. i'md avoiding me, too. avoiding everyone. got in a real bad funk. said uncalled for comments to me and to other people. i understand how depression can be; but that doesn't excuse her from being mean. from playing rough and with scissors (as a seventeen year old). from going out of her way to patronize people. but she put on her snapchat story her suicidal thoughts, talking about how everyone she knows is against her. so i swiped up, let her know that i apologize if i wronged her, and that i want her to be okay. that i don't think anyone is against her. that i am here if she needs to talk. she said that i can't make her pity me, and i was baffled. that she doesn't have the energy for my bullshit. (yikes.) that i shouldn't play nice if i don't feel nicely about a person. (still don't know what's she was talking about but it was childish. but still yikes.) and then she said all i do is complain about my family problems and boyfriend and do nothing to fix it. (that was when i said ""good to know,"" and blocked her. hehe.) it's so funny that she *asked me* what's wrong, didn't accept ""nothing"" for an answer, and then secretly hated when i was open and honest. i thought she was my friend. but i guess only therapists are meant to hear your problems. anyway. i digress. days after i blocked her, she came around me in person. went out of her way to sit next to me. acted fearful, as if i would reject her. took every single chance she got to be overly nice. for example: i was presenting and the class (of 13 people) was talking over me. she stood up, cupped both hands over her mouth, and projected: ""everyone! chris is talking! it is important to hear what they say, so that they can finish their presentation!"" sat down, then grinned at me. the class had the same weirded-out expression as i did. like. ugh. that was so artificial that it hurt me. i have a floridan friend who i tell some of these situations with, and he says it sounds like the other person has some unsolved problems of their own. my therapist said the same thing about all three scenarios. that nothing i complain about is like. ""i'm so sad my dad got me a blue car. i wanted a red one."" y'know? like the problems that bother me are literally ""so i'm homeless and don't know where i'm sleeping tonight "" or ""i got 27 spider bites in my sleep"" or ""my mom is threatening to kick me out and i'm an unemployed student"" or something that can't be given advice, because it's totally out of anyone's control. like when my car got totalled and i kept having flashbacks about the crash throughout the day. i couldn't sleep at night. for weeks. or when three of my classmates died. or when i was in a sexually abusive relationship for six months, got assaulted everyday on school grounds, and didn't tell anyone for eight months. i have flashbacks and awful dreams about *that* one to this day. but i don't say anything until someone asks me what's wrong. and even if they do, i'm reluctant to say so. bc none of this can be hugged better. it's heavy. it's uncomfortable and nobody wants to hear it. those are the only things that get to me. those are the things i go to therapy for. but my therapist doesn't believe in dwelling on (talking about) past traumas and griefs. i don't know what anyone wants me to do anymore. do i just let go of *everything*? i do not exagerrate; these things happened in the same twelve months. i'm not trying to excuse my complaints, but, yikes. i don't know what to make of any of this. anyway. tldr: nobody i open up to stick around. are all of these situations like. situations where both parties have made acceptable mistakes in handling their situation? or am i this unhappy person who makes people miserable because i complain so much? am i ungrateful? am i being crazy for saying the things i do? does anyone else hear statements like these from people who see you the most? it's times like these that makes self destructive behavior so easy."

depression,bipolar,1427,"if you feel shitty, help someone else not feel shitty. kinda shitty advice. but i'll start with some backstory. i'm on mobile so forgive me. (this will be kinda rambly) i was diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety disorder after i checked into a psychiatric hospital a few years back, but i always felt as i grew up that something was wrong. when i went to go meet my biological mother (who is very bipolar) when i was 18 things started to click with me that i needed to figure out a way to find meaning. it didn't help that my step-mom was an abusive cunt. so overall i kinda suck at being a person.(still do) anyways, i've struggled with constantly feeling down, and also feeling a whole lotta shit i didn't really understand. because of this i turned to weed and alcohol when i was 15. went through a few phases of drinking hard, but really weed was my poison of choice(still dont think it's bad but that's for another sub). again anyways because of the plant i kinda regained a sense of what it meant to be a healthy funcnt know how we'll pay the rent, things get complicated with family, with work, with life. and all of it together makes me wanna opt out. but then i think of leaving him by himself to deal with it himself and what a living hell that would be. even if i cant do much, ill do what i can till i can't. because if i dont that would make me sadder than anything i can ever encounter in my life. my point is that out there there are strong, amazing, incredibly intelligent and driven people, who do this shit alone. while feeling everything. and its heart breaking. my dad spent his life trying to make me feel welcome when every fiber of my being says i don't belong on this earth. the least i can do is gtfo bed and try to do something. even if my battle that day is just to brush my teeth. so that he can see a good looking smile that he made. to make him feel just a little better. that's my part, my mission. thats what gets me up. there are people that can use your help, and you owe it to them. but that s just my opinion."

depression,bipolar,1429,"why being high-functioning sucks ass don‚Äôt get me wrong , i‚Äôm very grateful that i can take care of myself , but i‚Äôm still depressed so i think i get at least some leeway to be pissed about this . what i hate is that when you‚Äôre high functioning you don‚Äôt have an illness to fall back on . it‚Äôs like when arthur fleck says ‚Äúthe worst part about having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don‚Äôt‚Äù . that‚Äôs extremely true in all cases but that‚Äôs how i feel right now as a high functioning . when you‚Äôre not high functioning people see that you‚Äôre not okay aat‚Äôs the thing . i‚Äôve been depressed for the last four years , but i‚Äôm high functioning so is it really valid ? when you don‚Äôt feel like cleaning or doing your laundry you‚Äôre dirty . when you can‚Äôt bring yourself to pick up after yourself you‚Äôre dirty . and why‚Äôs that ? because nothing is wrong with you and there‚Äôs no reason for you to be doing this . they don‚Äôt understand depression and it shows . it‚Äôs just annoying when you have to be normal like everyone else even though you constantly struggle and nobody sees that . it‚Äôs like if it isn‚Äôt tangible it just isn‚Äôt true !"
bipolar,depression,1430,being attracted to your therapist is weird it‚Äôs only because he‚Äôs a decent looking dude who‚Äôs fulfilling my current emotional needs by being supportive and understanding. since that‚Äôs his job haha. it‚Äôs like beer goggles but with depression.
bipolar,depression,1441,"financially fucked and lost my safety net. how is suicide not the answer? i wrote a post on here a bit ago about the troubles i was having with my mom and my situation has gotten a lot worse. i owe her a lot of money, they were paying for my car, phone, and treatment. basically ey worst case scenario and the only plan i ever had for it was finally going through with killing myself. even at my most stable, that was always the plan. so now i'm here. the worst has finally happened. i'm trying to find reasons not to go through with my plan and can't find any."
anxiety,ptsd,1457,"my name is kyle im suffering from serious trauma from my past. my father beat me and molested me. he also kissed me on the lips and demeaned me treating me like a girl. every time he looked at me, itd make me feel belittled and raped. my housemate has the same insecure belittling qualities my father has. i was also beaten and emotionally manipulated by an abusive mother who beat me with a stick, only yelled and never spoke, used me to polish her ego, used me to shame my father, shamed me, embarrassed and belittled me by objectifying me and herselfwn shit, call me fat and autistic, and just release his anger any chance he could in any way he could find using me. i need to get away from all this abuse. i want to love myself for who i am and comfort myself and be there for myself and love being me. i want my life back from all the abuse. i want to absolutely own my life. right now i need comfort and love and compassion and empathy for the little boy who was first beaten by his parents and left alone feeling abused and abandoned too young to do anything about it. its okay kyle. im here for you."
bipolar,depression,1459,"first try at spoken word writing... last week i wore my hair up everyday to work. not because i particularly like the way it looks, but because i couldn‚Äôt will myself the effort to take a shower for 5 days. wearing my ‚Äúdepression‚Äù hoodie that is 3 sizes too big, just so i can ignore my weight issue and have it‚Äôs dog hair covered fabric drape around my already dirty pajama shirt that i wore the last 4 nights. being this kind of sad is funny that way even something as mundane and rudimentary as doing my lke a ball of glitter about to explode taking shots at the bar with my friends and oversharing too much with too many people this happiness turns agitated and irritable every small inconvenience feels like i might just turn green, sprout some brown shorts and call myself hulk like a rubber band that is twisting tighter and tighter until it snaps. and cuts my arm with an exacto knife and down i fall again‚Ä¶ when people ask me how i am they should just ask me who i am today and what does my laundry look like"
adhd,anxiety,1463,"tonight i got ready for tomorrow morning i'll try to keep it short for you guys and myself, but i wanted to share my accomplishment with somebody who would get it. tonigff, i brushed my teeth, took my contacts out, and laid out my clothes for tomorrow. hell yeah. i'm off reddit for the night after submitting this, but thanks for reading."
ptsd,depression,1466,"i visited a psychiatrist today for the first time. this was my first time to share my story with other people. i was quite seriously addicted to taking drugs as self-mll in the making of decision to see psychiatrist, go for it. i feel like for the first time in my life, i took a step to change my life. (sorry if my english is bad...)"
