bipolar,depression,0,"i didn't care to do anything this year. the only reason i bought a cake is because i have a six year old. the only reason i'm posting is because... those younger than me: you'll be 31 one day, too. it gets better. you're worth every minute more of your life. i odied at 16 and struggled with suicidal ideations all throughout my twenties. i have an awesome kid. i decided to ask my fwb to be my bf yesterday and he said yes (wtf.) i am finally getting self discipline down and writing my books. i couldn't even imagine this all before. i've had the ups and downs but today, i am 31, and you'll get here one day, too."
anxiety,depression,4,"i feel like i've become a shit ton better as a person, but there are those nights that make me relive all those bad moments and i beat myself up so much that i get seriously messed up. what i wouldn't give to go back and do it all over the right way again..that way, i might've made better friends who would've lasted through maybe? or maybe these experiences, they've made me better as a person? they've shaped me? i dont know at this point."
none,adhd,7,"so i don't know where else to vent this frustration so i figure you guys will appreciate it here. i just spent the last half hour watching the ticketmaster page for bon iver's december 10th concert at the hammerstein in nyc. as soon as the timer ran out it went to a loading page and it felt like it was taking too long so i refreshed after about 10 seconds. it immediately loaded the ticket page with a quantity of 2 standard tickets in the best available section, which is what i wanted (it's ga on the floor). i hit search and had to do the security check *twice* (i selected all the fucking street numbers goddamnit) and then the page loaded and said there were no more tickets. there was a maximum of 30-45 seconds between when the tickets went on sale and when i got through the security check. buying tickets is nonsense and has to be fixed."
bipolar,adhd,10,"so last time i saw them they flat out said they don't trust me to take my meds and that even though i said i would, they don't believe me. then they told me i'm a liar because i've gone off meds before and told no one. first, yes i did go off my meds before for a lot of reasons but i always ended up getting back on them. this time i stopped for a stupid reason and i acknowledgeto take my meds without even asking why i stop them in the first place. they said they will cancel my prescription if the blood test results are low and they are not concerned that i'll be without meds. they were like, go to your gp if you like but i'll leave her a note. so i can't even go to my gp. tl;dr: i can't trust my own team anymore and i don't know where to go from here."
depression,anxiety,15,i feel like shit mentally and physically and i'm terrified :( and all at the time when i have received horrible news.. edit: thank you everybody who has commented and whoever else might want to share their experience. every single one of you has alleviated my depressive thoughts and anxiety. thank you. i hope this post has done the same for some of you aswell.
anxiety,ptsd,17,"i quit my job today. it was fucking terrible. not quitting, but being there. from september, i've had the worst time working there and trying my best for an abusive relationship. it took every fiber of my being to go through with it, but i feel like i've shed a ten ton husk. long time lurker, but i had to make an account to post this."
none,bipolar,21,i'm flying from dallas to hong kong in january and it's 17 hours. i've flown 12-13 hour flights before and they really mess with me. so i'm wondering - what are your tips for not going crazy on such a long flight? ps: i'm terrible at sleeping on planes. thinking about taking some sleepy meds to see if it'll help
depression,bipolar,22,"i'm on the long long road to recovery and the past few months have been comparitively really stable and happy for me. i don't cry nearly as often, i'm much more productive, and much more hopeful. but the second i do something wrong or encounter an issue, especially if someone's mad at me, i immediately jump back to thinking about suicide. it sends me into this spiraling panic that i'll never fix myself and be ok, until suicide feels like the way out. my mom was just screaming at me a lot yesterday and i was so close to just ending it right there, even though i know i don't really want to, and i know i'm gonna be in a better place in just over a month (going back to college)."
adhd,bipolar,26,"we all hate waking up and end up getting super alert at night, right? turns out that norephinephrine (one of the major things we are short on because it needs dopamine to make) is probably part of that. it is the thing that helps us become alert, increases steadily through the day, then resets when we sleep. so we wake up, are supet should, *and* norephinephrine helps regulate blood sugar levels, so we're more likely to be hypoglycemic zombies when we wake up in the morning, so we're screwed from multiple directions. ~~yes i have been geeking out researching neurotransmitters, why do you ask? don't worry, i'll have found a new fixation in a few more days :d~~"
adhd,depression,29,"i'm genuinely ecstatic! i never thought that i'd manage to come this far after my bout with depression last year but here we are! depression-free, and just full of boundless, controlled energy. but getting this job truly is by far, one of my greatest accomplishments to date. i never, *ever* thought i'd be at all considered for a job when put up against even ten people, let alone five thousand. the feeling of pride i have in myself is something i don't think i've felt before. to some extent i've always had a great deal of apathy when it came to personal fulfilment. that's why i want to thank you guys for your support, you're the reason i chose to get medicated. i hope now, i can help others achieve their goals too, as part of the collective community! tl;dr: got a job at a prestigious company at age 18. never thought i'd make it."
anxiety,ptsd,33,"i took the first step. i’ve been struggling so much for the past few months. it’s gotten to the point that i’m barely sleeping and when i do, i have insane nightmares. a couple weeks ago i booked a therapy appointment and it was today. i stood outside the building and came very close to just leaving because the idea of opening up about what i’m strug; if you’re wondering if you should start looking for a therapist, do it. if you’ve found a therapist that seems interesting but you’re not sure if you should reach out, do it. if you’ve made an appointment but you’re not sure if you should attend, attend it. and if you’re standing outside wondering if you should go in, go in. it will help, i promise."
adhd,ptsd,42,"you know how sometimes you'll just remember something in the past you did and cringe at yourself and its like, kinda physically painful? that's the feeling i'm talking about. for most people it just kinda comes and goes and they are fine bearing it for a moment, however i seem to either be hypersensitive to the feeling or just really bad at regulating it (probably a bit of both tbh), as half the time ""i wanna punch myself"" doesn't stop at just being a descriptor of how and feel and ends up being a bit of how i cope with it til it passes :/ i'll end up hitting myself on my leg or arm or something or punching a nearby wall as a way to relieve the tension, never hard enough to leave a lasting mark but often enough to be worrisome. i know it's not healthy but i don't know what else to do cuz the feeling is otherwise ui'll end up having a panic attack, yet i pretty much never actively avoid possible triggers and even signed up for my school's improv and dance clubs completely out of my own freewill (actually participating, however, is a different matter). basically, never happens to me lol. does anyone have any advice on better ways to cope with the cringe feelings, or with just emotional regulation in general? i'm on ritalin ir rn and while it does seem to help a bit, the problem is still very present, especially later in the evening or at night where i'm more tired and the meds have worn off. **tl;dr i have general emotional regulation problems and specifically always end up coping with ""cringe"" feelings with self harm. does anyone have advice on healthier ways to cope or other general help with emotional regulation?** thanks!"
depression,adhd,46,"i found $52 total from inside drawers, behind furniture, etc... i'm going to buy my mom and girlfriend something with it. it feels very nice to have a clean room."
anxiety,depression,48,"for example, my parents are going away for a week later this year. i don't want to be at home alone, but i can't sleep out of my house, i haven't slept out in at least 10 years. i asked a friend if they would mind sleeping over and they were like ""sure! i'd be glad to"". i was like, what, they just agreed like that??? they're so cool with sleeping out???? what???? aren't they going to miss their bed? and pets? and family? so weird to me."
depression,anxiety,52,"when you have depression or anxiety aging feels 10 times worse. i’m 21 and i feel incredibly old already. i suppose the worst part is that when you are a kid in highschool people always say that life “gets better” and of course the media really hypes up your early 20s as the best time in your life. i am very socially isolated with no friends. all i do is attend community college and feel like a failure... yet this is the so called “prime of my life?!” i find it depressing that my physical peak is coming and going so quick. i feel like i have no control over time - i constantly worry about how fast it’s passing and i’m not afraid to make life changes due to anxiety. i know , life doesn’t end when you turn 30. but for someone like me who probably never will get married or have kids aging seems hopeless. my body will decompose all while i get forgotten about by the world. hell, being lonely at 21 sucks enough i can’t imagine being lonely and isolated at 40+ ."
bipolar,adhd,53,"i’m trying to stay awake to go get my boyfriend from the airport. after i realized he was going to get in waaaay later than my bedtime of 9:30, and lamented about this with my aunt. she and i concocted a plan: i’d to drive over to her house, and then she’d give me a ride to the airport to pick up boyfriend, and then he cout about my early bedtime, i’m happy that my meds are working along with my habits. it feels nice to realize that my meds are working and now i can do a bunch of work in therapy, along with petting my cats and stuff. boy, i am tired. i hope this isn’t coming off as braggy, but it felt nice to realize that this is happening."
ptsd,anxiety,56,i've started to use cbd oil to manage my anxiety and i feel like a person again. i have energy to both accept any negative feelings i have and still put out a positivity to other people. which is something i struggle with when my anxiety is fully active since it pulls me down and it's difficult for me not to come off nasty when all my energy is spent fighting anxious thoughts and coping with the feelings it creates. i have an easier time talking myself down from my anxious thoughts and can function better in public in general. i can focus when i read and not forget things because i don't have my brain going a mile a minute. this stuff makes me feel like my life has changed drastically. i'm so grateful it exists.
adhd,none,58,"also i started the bulk of writing it three weeks ago! 25 chemical reactions ran, 9000 words, 80 pages, about 100 graphs created to visualize data, and another 40 illustrations of the reaction pathway. yay"
anxiety,adhd,59,"hey all, i've noticed recently that i've been putting things where they don't belong, or opening cabinets to look for things that i know are in another cabinet. i'm 20. sometimes i'll be walking and i'll have to ask myself ""where am i even walking to?"" then i have to think about what time it is and what day it is and say ""oh, i'm going to english class."" or sometimes i'll be sending a text and something else will happen and i'll put the phone down only to open it up later and realize i never sent the text. appointments slip my mind constantly or i'll remember that i never went somewhere i was supposed to and then think about it and think ""wait, yes i did do that/go there."" it's really scaring the shit out of me. anyone else have these types of memory lapses?"
anxiety,depression,62,"i haven't worked for 3 and half years due to my mental health being so bed that i couldn't face it. i worked in a stressful job but had to quit... my new non stressful, just above minimum wage job starts tomorrow and i am so happy! i don't even care about the money, it's not important at this point. i can't wait to moan about being tired from work and having to make my lunch etc. i am 30 years old and finally my life is getting back on track. please don't ever give up if you're struggling. you will make it out at the other end."
adhd,bipolar,67,i have an issue with balance. i never know when i'm on the path to burnout until i get there because i don't know how to differentiate between pushing through for discipline or pushing myself past my limits. does that make sense? does anyone have advice?
adhd,anxiety,73,"they're both red, so they're totally the same thing, right? uuuuugh. and then i had to do the awkward ""oh no, actually i can't buy that, i'm so sorry"" thing and run away. so embarrassing. and even better, my car is in a parking garage and i'm going to have to call my boyfriend to come bring me money so that i can get it out. super awesome job today, self. sorry, just needed to vent. do neurotypical people really not do this shit all the time? because i feel like i do it way too often."
depression,anxiety,74,i make a lot of mistakes and am very awkward so i end up thinking the words “kill yourself” dozens of times a day. it’s like a reflex at this point. i’m not actually going to kill myself but it’s like some subconscious desire bubbling up from deep down. i’m afraid i’ll start saying it out loud or something
adhd,bipolar,75,"finished my bachelor's after 7 years, 5 years to get my aa untreated and it was extremely hard. got treatment, went back to school, and finished in 2 years while being student of the year for my major. took my 2.0 gpa that i had while received my aa and by the time i completed my ba i had a 3.1 cumulative. this last year has been extremely hard with losing (in this order) my dog, grandma, mother, and cat. i think of my mother every day but i was able to finish last two quarters and graduate on time. everyone of you can do it. don't let people bring you down and don't waste time getting treatment and support. i wouldn't be here now if i didn't get the help i needed. i'm done with dead end jobs, seven years is a long time but i'm glad i did it. you can do it."
bipolar,anxiety,82,"i gotta vent. dad, you've been giving mixed compliments for the past week. backhanded praise and shit. ""i don't care if you fail, i care if you try."" too fucking bad dad, i care more if i fail than if i try, and i get that that doesn't get me anywhere; it feels pretty shitty to be reminded my ridiculous rejection sensitivity makes me a terrible person. fine, impedes my success. you didn't call me a terrible person. but that's what i'm getting at. the rejection sensitivity. what amounted to ""your not trying for the sake of avoiding getting hurt disappoints and irritates me"" turned into ""you're a terrible person."" or maybe i took it to mean ""you're broken."" i often think i am. how do you think it feels when i submit 10 job applications and my brain does the same thing about not hearing back? how do you think it feels to be constantly looking at jobs trying to balance what i'm qualified for, what won't be soul-crushingly mind-numbing, and what will actually move me forward in life? and then after beating myself up to get myself to start and continue that process, getting discouraged either not hearing back or hearing i didn't get the job. and then there's: what if i actually here back? interviews are std am now telling myself ""you're gonna be the lazy drug using social security beneficiary nobody wants to get their money"" while i tell myself i don't deserve it because i feel like a liar. but you know what? it may hurt, **but i take it on for you**. because i acknowledge my debilitating fear of trying on the job front and would rather take on shame than let my failure to launch weigh you down. when i was growing up, i used to tell myself ""no one can hurt you more than your own family."" i think that's still true for me today. thanks dad. *do you know why i changed therapists after you got your cancer diagnosis?* **i wanted to make sure you'd be proud of me before you died.** i sure as hell don't feel like you are right now. tl;dr: my dad hurt me and pissed me off by telling me he doesn't feel like i try and expressing frustration at how much time i put into videogames (where i can at least feel successful at **something**) when i spent less time on videogames today than half of what i spend most days in general. seriously, videogaming and weight loss are the only two things i've succeeded at since graduation. maybe not dying, too, but i don't think that should count. good to know i'm a disappointment."
bipolar,depression,89,just like the title says lose shit and can’t remember shit most of the time just going to motions super hyper to super depressed n seconds don’t know how to talk to nobody can’t express emotions cuz it’s a billion of them hate everyone cry randomly always tired stupid tic from pass meds multiple personalities nobody understands or take the time to understand wat a great fucking life i live :/
ptsd,anxiety,91,"i know it's only september but i'm already feeling it, especially with halloween advertising everywhere already. usually go see in-laws but don't know if i can handle that at all this year...."
bipolar,adhd,95,"but i kept having spoonfuls of honey? i guess that wasn't enough calories how come we don't have much of an appetite when in elevated states? i've heard this happening to others too. although, once i eat something, i remember i'm actually hungry, and want more. but it's easy to forget for a rather long time.."
depression,bipolar,96,"i really let it get out of hand this time folks. i got an email today saying i’m being excluded from my academics (meaning won’t be able to go to class...) because i didn’t pass 2 of my classes. so now, my choices are 1. talk to the dean to see if i qualify for a cancellation of exclusion, 2. get suspended, or 3. drop out of school. this really pte limit. i’m not sure if i’ll be able to take it. i can’t live with my parents again. my dad doesn’t believe in mental illness whatever that means. thinking about this situation makes me hate everything. im so done with life. i don’t know why i even try anymore. i knew i wasn’t cut out for college and i might as well give up and go waitress again"
bipolar,depression,100,"i live in south texas. the weather here is always humid and hot as balls, however we are finally beginning to see some weather changes. it was pouring almost all day yesterday and this morning when i walked out of my apartment to leave for work, it was fresh! fresh and cloudy and so beautiful, but then i started to feel the depression creeping in. for fuck's sake *eyerolls so fucking hard*"
ptsd,anxiety,104,i've had them for several years and i'm passed getting suicidal/etc but it just gets really hard to breath and always ends up disabling me for a good few hours. obviously i know what's happening and that it will pass but i just need advice that will help it pass faster. i have 2 jobs and they are setting me back time wise so much and i'm just really frustrated.
bipolar,anxiety,110,"i can’t sleep because my thoughts are racing, but i’m highly depressed and want to crawl into a hole. i had a few real low days last week and took off work - couldn’t sleep enough! the past 48 hours, though, i feel like i can’t sleep even a solid 20 minutes straight. yet i want to puke and curl up into a ball and just pick my skin excessively. just venting...."
anxiety,ptsd,112,"my anxiety when i first wake up everyday is so strong i struggle to leave my bed. i wake up from a typically sound sleep and get thrown into a shitstorm nearly everyday. i used to have ptsd related nightmares; thankfully those have died down but it sometimes feels like all the anxiety just builds up overnight and needs to get released every morning. i feel plastered to my bed with a racing mind that i can't control. i've tried things like ""you know this will go away in an hour. just ride it out"". i've tried grounding techniques. i've tried different types of weed and different benzos. i'm thinking about doing a small meditation everyday to see how that makes me feel- are there good apps out there i could try?"
bipolar,adhd,113,"i do at times. sometimes i will say ""the splu biders"" or ""tub bath"". reading is fine and easy, not dyslexic at all but the speech is weird. today i forget to take my meds, and found it to be worse than normal (with meds). anyone else experience this?"
anxiety,depression,126,"i think about this a little more than i should... and then i keep saying “you have nothing wrong with you! your parents were right, you’re just faking it for the attention! and then think about that until you cry? bothers me."
ptsd,bipolar,130,"i was a great man for a great many of years, however it had a toll that i never recognized. for 32yrs i was a resuscitation specialist. i was the one that brought back the dead. in the field then in the hospital icu's, and er's. i never went to a debriefing, never saw a psychologist/psychiatrist, i just buried my dead in a vault deep in my mind. now im broken. and lost. my only lucid moments now are moments that ive completely numbed my soul with scotch and weed. i oft wonder if i should take the final leap and end the suffering, the same as a patient with terminal illness who suffers, and the treatment is terminal mso4, via iv. the end comes quietly wrapped in the wisps of a morphine cloud. ..."
anxiety,depression,144,i feel drained and exhausted. every day. even when i exercise. i'm so lonely but no one ever hangs out with me or talks with me. most of my friends left and now i'm back to where i started. :/ i feel guilty to and idk why. i've never experienced this type of sadness before
anxiety,ptsd,146,"my wife passed out from a panic attack yesterday in the theatre while we were watching *a quiet place*. i was so scared and didn't know what to do. about an hour into the movie, there's a scene where someone steps on a nail. it wasn't even very gory, but i guess it triggered some bad memories for her. a few seconds after that scene, my wife's arm started twitching kind of like a seizure. at the same time, she started making sounds like she was snoring or maybe choking. when i looked at her, her head was lolled to the side and her eyes were closed. not realizing what was happening, i nudged her a bit, thinking she had fallen asleep. when her head rolled to the other side and there wasn't any other response my concern sky-rocketed. i took her head in my hands and gently shook her a little bit trying to wake her up. her eyes partially opened, and i could see her pupils were looking up like when you roll your eyes. there was no other response. i tilted her head forward and the ""snoring"" sound stopped, but she was still unconscious. at this point, about half a minute or so had passeder feel safe. i tried to just hold her and comfort her. after about a half hour she was doing better. i felt so helpless when she was unconscious. it's very scary when you suddenly realize your loved one is having a medical emergency. later in the evening, she revealed to me that when she was a teenager, she had an abusive boyfriend that would rape her, cut her with a scalpel, and poke her with needles. sick stuff like that i guess. she wouldn't say much more about it than that. i am angry. not at her, but at the thought some sicko did this to her. and i hurt. i grieve that she has experienced something so traumatic it causes this type of thing. she agreed we will get her into some therapy. she needs healing that i never knew she needed. i also know this isn't about me, but i feel a bit hurt this is just now coming out. we've been married about 5 years, and i never knew this stuff. what else don't i know? i don't know what type of advice i'm looking for. how can i be there for her? how can i help? what do i do if this happens again? did i do the right thing both during and after?"
anxiety,adhd,147,"have just come of my meds last month after managing to travel the world for a year on my own and then staring my first year at university. years ago i physically couldn’t leave the house for months at a time out of fear, now i am a completely new person. you can beat this, no matter how long it takes."
anxiety,depression,151,"i came into this year in a good place after years of wading through shit. i was kicking ass at my job, i have sorted a long term medical problem, i achieved dreams this winter by freeride snowboarding a mountain. i came out as bi / genderfluid to my family and it went well. but this year since then has fucked me up. i haven't touched another human in three months. i've been single for 12 years. i happening again every day recently. i don't want to see any more fucking therapists any more i hate the idea of it. i can't go through reopening all that painful old stuff again i don't want to deal with this bullshit any more. i don't want to burden my family with this, i've put them through enough. fucking 2020. its a good job i don't have a gun because its sure looking like a way to escape recently."
none,adhd,152,"maybe this way of saying it is fine, but when people ask around and compare test scores, i genuinely believe and want to tell people that they shouldn't focus on what other people scored but focus on themselves and their own work. i don't want to sound too formal or even rude since i am a student. so how should i reply to people asking whatever test mark i received?"
bipolar,depression,154,it’s only because he’s a decent looking dude who’s fulfilling my current emotional needs by being supportive and understanding. since that’s his job haha. it’s like beer goggles but with depression.

depression,bipolar,170,"i took a number of ssris during my last depressive episode and wellbutrin xl was the only one that made me flip into ""good days"" on occasion, however, would often slip back into depression after i went to sleep and woke up. i finally got out of my last depressive episode was during a ""good day"" where i got angry about flipping back to depression each time, that i vowed to wake up the next day feeling normal. strangely, it worked! i was feeling good for about 1 1/2 years, off the wellbutrin xl, and life was good. about 5 months ago, i fell back into depression and am taking wellbutrin xl again. hasn't done much but in 5 months, have only flipped into a ""good day"" twice where i feel normal, energized, have my motivation back and feel like my old self. i tried to get angry and vowed to wake up to being feeling good, but sadly, the next morning i was back to a deep depression. has anyone else had this experience?"
anxiety,none,171,"came across news this morning that hip hop celebrity kid cudi checks himself into rehab for depression and suicidal thoughts. he wrote this letter to his fans where anxiety is mentioned. just wanted to say that none of us are alone in our fight with anxiety. here is the letter: ""its been difficult for me to find the words to what im about to share with you because i feel ashamed. ashamed to be a leader and hero to so many while admitting i’ve been living a lie. it took me a while to get to this place of commitment, but it is something i have to do for myself, my family, my best friend/daughter and all of you, my fans. yesterday i checked myself into rehabima get through this. i wont be around to promote much, but the good folks at republic and my manager dennis will inform you about upcoming releases. the music videos, album release date etc. the album is still on the way. promise. i wanted to square away all the business before i got here so i could focus on my recovery. if all goes well ill be out in time for complexcon and ill be lookin forward to seeing you all there for high fives and hugs. love and light to everyone who has love for me and i am sorry if i let anyone down. i really am sorry. ill be back, stronger, better. reborn. i feel like shit, i feel so ashamed. im sorry. i love you, scott mescudi"

depression,adhd,175,it's 1:40pm and i am sitting alone in taco bell eating a shredded chicken burrito and nacho fries. dining room is totally empty. wendy's is normally where i go because the dining room is always more active and feels a bit more cozy vs the sterile decor and hard seats of taco bell but i am getting bored of eating the same thing so figured i'd have some tb instead. not even sure of the point to typing this other than than to share my boredom. outside of errands or making service calls to clients my fast food outings are usually the only time i go out of the house.
none,adhd,181,"i'm feeling very discouraged. i have a fever, sore throat and cold and my bunk mates and i confirmed we have bed bug bites this morning. the hostel confirmed it and now i'm hanging around waiting for my stuff to wash instead of going to malbrok castle. any suggestions on what to do with my bag, purse and electronics? my bag was on my bed and my purse sat there a bit. my electronics also touched it. i didn't find any signs on my bed but i did get bitten. not sure if the washing machine will fit my bag. i have only been on this trip 4 days and while the travelling has been amazing, bed bugs and sick to start off with has been horrible."
bipolar,anxiety,183,things aren’t even that bad for me right now. last week was way worse. i’m doing okay at work keeping up with my to do list. i’m getting along with the family. for some reason i feel like i want to go to the hospital to get away from life. this is a feeling i’ve had many times. i always remind myself how much more comfortable my bed is in those moments. does anyone else have those thoughts?
adhd,anxiety,201,"just in case anyone isn't aware of what learned helplessness feels like, and as a warning to people not to keep trying the same thing over and over, i've written the following. i will use the term ""brain"" to refer to the unconscious, impulsive parts of the brain, the parts that aren't ""you"", and ""you"" to refer to your conscious experience and rational brain. (disclaimer, this is only my experience, i don't know what other people's experiences are.) --- imagine walking around, going through life, except you don't decide what you do. your brain decides everything for you and you have no say. it wants to play video games, so you play video games. that isn't to say you don't fight it, but on those occasions that you do you either are simply unable to do anything, or every frustration with yourself for every past failure floods upon you, washing your willpower away in a tidal wave of anxiety. you quickly learn the only way to fight is to not fight at all. --- now, imagine somebody calmly tells you, ""i know it's hard, but you really need to just get up and do it. i have no magic bullet unfortunately."" this is nice, they know that you have a hard time ""just doing it"" but at this point there's no way around it, it just needs to be done. you wholeheartedly agree with them, and feel like the ultimate solution _is_ to ""just do it"". your brain however immediately reminds you how ""it's never worked before, so why will it work now?"" this isn't just a small voice, it is backed by the combined anxiety of every failure and inadequacy you have ever had. --- i'll attempt to explain what lies behind this sense of hopelessness: this sense of hopelessness, in its simplest form, is the feeling that ""it's never worked, so why would it change?"" however, it goes deeper than that. the following is the main thought process: - according to other people you just need to try hard enough to solve the problem - you feel like you have tried counn't care anymore"" ( ditto ) - ""i hate myself"" (when i metaphorically close my eyes, cover my ears, and run from what i need to do yelling ""lalalalalalalala"", also when i am sitting doing something i enjoy and remember what i'm supposed to be doing) - ""i just can't."" (when i try to calm myself or when i'm lying in a fetal position on the bed, spiraling deeper into depression) - ""i just want the world to go away"" (this feeling makes me realize why some people kill themselves. i fortunately just retreat to my bed or some form of entertainment that allows my brain to shut off temporarily) --- i'm not saying this is permanent problem, or that there aren't any solutions, just that it's incredibly difficult, more difficult than i feel most anyone can imagine. it's the torture of hopelessness, with the frustration of fully knowing with your rational brain that hope itself is all that is needed to solve the problem, yet finding that hope hopelessly far away. please, everyone. think before you tell someone to ""just try."" they may have forgotten how to. --- edit: some people may say that you just need to build in systems, and i agree that that is a good solution, but at least for me, i've tried so many of my own systems that even trying to talk with it causes my brain to lock up with anxiety. likely because it forces me to confront all my past failures, which further discourages me from trying. i'd still love to hear any advice people have though. --- tl;dr; learned helplessness isn't thinking you are helpless, it is feeling that you've forgotten how to try. if you really wanted to try it would have worked, since people say to just try, so you must not really _want_ to try, so you begin to instead want to want to try. in addition, confronting it in any way brings with it all the anxiety of every past failure, meaning that often, instead of doing something you often fail to do you just close your eyes and hope it'll go away."
ptsd,anxiety,204,"so long story short, recently i’ve been noticing i have more stomach troubles. vomiting, diarrhea, etc. yesterday i had another “stomach bug” but i noticed as soon as i was home it started to go away. it started after this guy was too close to me and was being generally creepy. i almost shit myself in a mcdonald’s and threw up as well on my way home. the last time this happened, a man had gotten too close to me and i almost threw up in my car on the way home. does anyone else experience this? is this something i should tell my psychiatrist?"
bipolar,anxiety,206,"yesterday was rough. i broke things off with my ex the day before yesterday due to some toxic and manipulative behavior. he freaked out on me and has been sending me messages on every app possible saying some of the most horrible things imaginable up until yesterday evening when i blocked him on everything possible. we we're dating for 6 years and i feel so fucking dumb. it was obvious he was trying to hurt me and he didn't, but he den i said i didn't want to hang again he tried to blame me for his actions so i blocked him too. i think i'm ok emotionally, but what the fuck? idk why i keep attracting people like this. i just don't understand and i'm so sick of it. i'm a sweet person and i don't feel like i deserve it. anyway, i just wanted to vent about my fucking horrible day yesterday. it was a scary day. as always, you guys are wonderful people and thank you :)"
bipolar,depression,211,"i was recently pming with someone about relationships, heartbreak, and feeling broken and picked up on a shared sentiment. that our mental illnesses made us less deserving of love from healthy people. which my rational mind tells me is total bullshit, but it's still a sentiment i have to put effort into rejecting. it's no secret i've been investing serious time into online dating, but i think it's progress on my part that most of the time i don't feel like my mental illness disqualifies me from relationships with healthy people. i still feel like i'll be better understood by people who experience depression and whatnot and like my issues will be less of a burden to someone with their own struggles for me to give back to, but as i was thinking abouto more broken than any ""normie."" *how many of you have struggled to feel like it's okay to have relationships with healthy people, and of those of you who have, what if anything has helped you chip away at that feeling?* as broken as i've felt and as flawed as i've been, i've never been broken and i've never stopped being worth loving. there have been things about me that have made it harder to love me, like my former bmi of nearly 40 as a barrier to that kind of attracted attention, but even then i was sometimes shown that kind of love. **however broken you may feel and however unlovable you may feel, you are most certainly mistaken. you are complete and just as flawed as everyone else and worthy of love, however hard it may be to find that love.**"
anxiety,depression,213,"posting this is extremely nerve-wracking, but hey, i'm doing it! oh. my. god. i actually did it you guys! 6 months ago my psychologist convinced me to take an online english class... i was so reluctant and was about to quit more than a handful of times, but despite crying my eyes out my psychologist wouldn't let me quit. she knew i could do it, and i'm so thankful she didn't enable me when i wanted to run the other way. i owe this woman everything. it's been 7+ years since i finished school, and this is the only thing i have accomplished since then. it was without a doubt hard and it felt impossible at times, but i'm so proud of myself now - something that rarely happens."
bipolar,adhd,225,ive accepted my need to be on medication and im gonna take it seriously this time. im starting lamotragine back up. im on a 75 day streak on daylio. super proud over here. but also a bit frustrated. i wish this wasnt my life. but im learning to accept it and not fight the flow.
depression,anxiety,234,"i've been dealing with this long enough that i'm fairly certain things aren't going to get better. medication doesn't work. talk therapy doesn't work. hitting the gym doesn't work. getting degrees in psychology doesn't work. consulting experts in the field doesn't work. moving out to the country doesn't work. and that's fine. i'm okay with that now. i'm just not really suited for the human experience. not really my thing. i'm just gonna give my pets as much happiness as i can until they pass. and when they go, i'll be going as well. i know this sorta post isn't really that helpful here. i just wanted to get the thoughts out of my head and articulate them to someone other than myself. please don't tell me to call a hotline and listen to some underpaid stranger try to convince me that i'm mistaken."
anxiety,depression,243,"i consistently talk to myself. sometimes i will sit down, and have conversations with myself. it's like a back and forth q&amp;a; as my mind wonders off about a curiosity, or uncertainty, i will verbally answer myself, sometimes in great detail. not sure if this is just an inflated ego answering my insecurities, or if this is just normal human behavior. sometimes i compulsively call myself negative names too. like ""idiot"", ""stupid"", or ""loser"". in all honesty, i feel like i only call myself these names to motivate myself to do better next time. however, i'm not sure how helpful it really is."
bipolar,ptsd,245,"i’m in a good place in my life right now, and i finally found a good balance of medicine and therapy, etc. but i keep getting paranoid that people around me are going to wake up one day and dislike me or want to hurt me. i know that logically, most people (especially the people i surround myself with) are very upfront about their feelings. they’re all very caring and they love me. and if they have an issue with you, they’ll talk to you about it. but because of my unmedicated days, and the days where i felt like i didn’t have quite so much control over my impulses or thoughts or feelings, i’ve convinced myself that everyone has trouble with that. and that someday, they’ll all leave in the same way that i walked out of people’s lives in the past. it makes it really hard to form meaningful relationships sometimes."
adhd,none,251,"i often have people bring up songs/albums/bands or movies/tv shows during conversation. they might say, ""have you seen or heard x?"" and if i have i will say ""yeah, i liked it, enjoyed it etc etc etc"". however, as soon as they go into more details such as band members or actor names, favourite lines from movies or lyrics from songs i can't actually remember any information beyond a couple of bits even though i know i've seen/heard it and i liked it. i fear it makes me appear as a compulsive liar who says they like things just to fit in when in reality i just cannot remember many details, lines, names or lyrics, just i enjoyed said movie/show/album etc. anyone else get this? feelsbadman.jpeg."
bipolar,depression,256,"im beginning a 20h odyssey halfway across the world to get to my father's funeral in time. the man died young, and it came out of nowhere. just numb right now, flashes of memories. going to try and stay sane for the family. wish me luck."
adhd,bipolar,258,"this cycle repeats itself until we/i get depressed--a low level but long lasting state of depression without swings, without strong emotions, a sort of vacant apathy. this isn't at all to say that its perpetual or hopeless, i'm just looking to open discussion about how to break this (without medication). for too many of us this pattern is sustainable. it leaves us drained and ashamed, but because of circumstance theres nothing that kicks us into gear. feel free to vent and support others, different perspective is good perspective!"
ptsd,depression,261,i can't function. i have a test in the morning and a final exam thursday that i won't be attending. she ran away and got hit by a car and died. i don't know how i'm going to go on. i can't live without her.
none,adhd,263,"i am not a native english speaker, however, i like to hear english songs every now and then mainly because of their beats. my problem is that i find it really hard to understand the words in the song. like, i can't figure out what they are saying except for a few words. although, once i read the lyrics, it starts to make sense. what should i do?"
adhd,depression,266,was anyone else reminded of what a burden and a distraction they were to the point that now they go to moronic lengths not to inconvenience anyone? i often do this and it always makes things worse. any coping strategies?
anxiety,depression,275,"depersonalization/dissociating is the closest thing i've found to how i feel but not quite. i feel like i'm just floating through my days. like they fade into each other and i'm just trying to get through each one to make it into the next. i feel so unattached to my surroundings/environment, it makes me feel so awful. i don't feel present, but not necessarily in the ""you don't feel attached to your body"" way like depersonalization generally is described, but i just don't feel present. i don't know any other way to put it. i'm physically there and thats about it. i don't feel like i can relate to anyone either, so i don't bother going out of my way to communicate with anyone (say in a class setting) which just adds to the not-present feeling. what is this called, if anything? and what can i do about it? i'm so miserable"
depression,bipolar,279,"my life sucks now and has always sucked. i've always struggled with depression, bipolar and self harm and awful social anxiety. waking up and thinking about all the years ahead, makes me absolutely exhausted in a way that sleep can't even touch. i realized the other day.. i don't wanna be alive, but i also don't want to die. i feel like there's a chance later on, my life could be amazing. a husband &amp; family, a job, ect.. and if i died, i'd never get to experience what i want so bad. so for now, i guess i'll keep doing what i'm doing and hope something changes and just keep hope. anyone else ever felt this way?"
ptsd,depression,284,"the most i'm granted is the sick, gut churning nausea that nearly comes up but i force myself to swallow. i either feel sick, or nothing. i never truly sleep. and i wake up wishing i wouldn't. just needed to vent. thanks for listening."
anxiety,depression,291,"tomorrow i bury my best friend who tragically passed away at the age of 25. i'm heartbroken and i will be speaking at his funeral. i am happy with the speech but i am nervous, petrified to mess up. he was an incredible guy and i want to send him off well, justify what he meant to me. my ex who broke up with me 2 months ago has kept contact to ask how i have been doing and if i ever needed anything go to her. i went to the gym yesterday evening just to pass the time and maybe work off a small hangover i was nursing from the night before. i felt okay but by the end of my session i was very tired. as i was walking back towards my flat i spot my ex with a guy next to her sitting down. i could have turned around but i didn't. i go up to her and say hi, she seems shocked to see me and asks if i'm doing okay. i say no, not really and say i'll leave them to it and say goodbye. as i walk down the road my ex has caught up with me after she runs to catch up with me. she says she has done this to tell me thatuy who has a family that makes her laugh, feel alive. this guy has a child. i recognise him from her xmas party. i'm really confused about why she chased after me. it's obvious she cares but is she feeling guilty, trying to spare my feelings in the hardest time of my life. i do want her back in my life but seeing her with another guy hurt big time. seeing them close to each other eating ice cream. she works with him, did she like him when we were dating. i also hate the idea of her sharing her sympathy and support with other people, especially a guy like that. and it hurts to hear her say to me he's going through a hard time. i'm going through the hardest time of my life. i feel like i can't use her as a crutch. i'm so confused, hurt, a mess. i bury my best friend tomorrow . i am absolutely terrified. i feel sick, like i'm going to mess up and ruin everything. the last 2 months has been the worst of my life, it just has. i want things to be better. i want him back. i want her back. i feel terrible."
anxiety,depression,294,"i feel alone and useless unless i'm high or drunk. i might be failing classes at this point, or at least close to, but i can't go to class unless i'm on something without feeling like i want to kill myself or just give up completely. i'm even high right now, i haven't been sober in over a week."
adhd,depression,295,"apologies for the use of that word in this post, for those who might be sensitive to it. *edit again* copy/pasting a comment to another user: where i'm from people use it as a slur toward the autism community. i'm actually not even sure it's just where i'm from - i see it all over the internet too. i don't personally think they're synonymous but since i witness ""autistic"" and ""retarded"" being used in the same sentence by shitty people all the time, i only wanted to be clear that i don't feel the same way and that i don't want to hurt anyone with my post :( that's why i had previously written that i don't use that word, nor would i ever call someone that anywt. but when i argue with my boyfriend i can barely remember what i've just said...i can't always remember how the argument even started. i get really flustered and then that gets worse. all i seem to hear is ""you're wrong."" i'm not always good at getting across what i mean the first time, either. so in frustration last night, my boyfriend asked me ""are you retarded?"" and it honestly hurt me a bit. i know some of you have had people ask you that. you start giving the question some thought because you feel you can't do anything right, ever. i'm not sure why i'm making this post...just feeling down in general. fucks with me every time, when someone asks me that."
anxiety,depression,302,"yes. you. the person reading this right now. you're amazing. i'm telling you because you probably don't hear it as much as you deserve to. because you're battling some really tough things that most people won't ever understand. because even though you're doing that, and it's hell, you're still here. i don't know if you realize what a major accomplishment that is, but i'm here to tell you, it's fucking incredible. you're incredible. keep fighting. keep going. it's going to be okay. i know it doesn't feel like it sometimes (or a lot of the time), but it really will. you're going to have glorious moments of sunshine to make all this rain worth it. those moments are going to see you through the storms. because there will be storms. maybe you're in the storm right now. you'll get through it. because you're strong, stronger than you think you are. you're incredible and strong, and i know you can do it. i have faith in you. i'm here for you. you. are. amazing."

ptsd,anxiety,318,"hello, i just got a weighted blanket and was trying it for a month to help me sleep. i was sleeping amazing with it for 2 weeks, (i'm 5'9, weigh 140lbs, male 27 year old just fyi) but then started getting a pain in my chest when i was sleeping. i was loving the blanket so much i just ignored the pain hoping it would go away. it kinda comes and goes. i t it was horrible. i basically need the weighted blanket now, i can tell i am addicted to it, but i need to find some way to avoid the chest pain. could a lighter blanket be better? i'm also going to try having it only on my legs and feet tonight. maybe that could work. brainstorming, thanks for reading this and if you have advice it would be appreciated."
ptsd,anxiety,325,"i don't mean for this to be a huge downer, i've just been stuck in this rumination for a while now. even on my best days i feel disconnected and never able to fully live in the moment. i'm worrying about the past or future, i'm overthinking a million different moments and possibilities at once. i'm dissociating li. idk. i just feel like everyone is behind a glass wall can't cross. people are graduating and marrying and forming families and i just feel perpetually lost despite my efforts to get better. i think i just need a bit of hope. i'm trying though, i really am. i'm no longer on rock bottom but it's all just difficult."
ptsd,depression,337,"i’m so tired of having bad memory, it makes me feel so stupid. i’ve been watching the star wars movies with my boyfriend for the last week and i can’t remember hardly anything. i get the basic plots but names and details are always lost on me. i have to ask questions the whole time and it’s genuinely creeping out my boyfriend. he doesn’t understand how i can forget a detail from 20 minutes ago. i’m just sad. i use to have great memory and now i can’t even enjoy entertainment. i just feel like a shell."
depression,bipolar,353,"i've joined this sub-reddit filled with pure agony with all the things i've experienced in school, family, and myself. but eversince this year, i've managed to find love, gain my old friends with a handful of new ones, and i've finally become academically stable. everything is going well, family still needs a couple of help financially and emotionally but despite that i think i'm finally complete. i've read so much posts here that i could relate to, giving me reassurance that im not alone. it made me stronger, it helped me understand what i was going through and how can i get out and im finally free from all of the sadness and constant days of wanting to dissapear and hoping for death to come. i thank you guys for helping me in a way that is unnoticable but very remarkable, i hope that i won't be alone in getting out. it's very pretty here i hope that i get to meet you all once again. music helped me alot too :)"
anxiety,depression,354,like i hate it for two reasons because first of all it either emasculating or infantilising. and second it implies that im not doing my best or at the least not trying or sometimes it comes off as someone making light of my feelings.
depression,bipolar,363,"i didn't wake up yesterday until 6pm. i laid in bed until 9, woke up and bought a case of beer and 2 packs of cigarettes and started binge drinking. i took a shower for the first time in days. i wanted to be clean and drunk for what i planned to do. today is my 25th birthday. i didn't want to live this day. i planned to cut my arms up and bleed to death in the shower, but i wanted to play a few last rounds of rocket league to calm my nerves. then i got a message from a random player i was in a few matches with: ""wanna play in a party? playing with randoms is getting onmy spirits throughout the day today. i've told my family everything and will be seeking help in the form of therapy and a possible medication adjustment, if necessary. if you're out there reading this and you can't see the way back up, cling to me and we'll climb up together. again, thank you all so much for taking the time out of your day to wish me well and feel free to pm me anytime or to add me on psn: coonroast55 (it has to do with my last name and the fact that me and my friends used to put -roast on the end of everyone's last name for no reason whatsoever). &lt;3"
adhd,depression,367,thank you to this [wonderful who went waaaay out of their way to try and hurt my feelings but ended up turning a bad day into a good one because it reminded me that some people have it worse. there are people out there who only feel good when they make others feel bad and those are the people to feel truly sorry for. i'm so flattered that they saw me as a target :)
adhd,bipolar,371,"i recently learnt that executive dysfunction can be broken down into two main categories: anxiety that your attempt won't be satisfactory, or confusion about where to start or how to break it down into steps. as much as we feel bad about it, it's extremely important to remember that it is not laziness and we in fact shouldn't feel bad."
ptsd,depression,372,"i feel completely trapped in my own head. i've had that ""chair is about to fall backward"" feeling day in and day out for like three weeks now. it's becoming exhausting. i feel like a thousand screaming emotions are trapped behind a stone exterior. i can't cry or yell or write. i can't express any emotions, even for moms most of the time, it's just particularly bad right now and trying to out-logic my emotions is just overwhelming sometimes. right now is one of those times. you guys are my people and i guess i'm not really looking for solutions, just someone to remind me that it will pass and maybe offer up some tips on self-care."
bipolar,anxiety,373,"i was offered a full-time job recently and turned it down due to mental health concerns. time has passed, i've had time to consider things further, and my circumstances regarding treatment and therapy have changed. the hr rep who called me said that, if i change my mind about the position, all i have to do is reapply. openings are frequent. today i got notice of another opening and reapplied. i feel confident about taking this on at this point in my life. yes, a crap ton of stuff is going against me. but i feel like i can do this. for once, i'm taking that chance. as my best friend says, watch this space. it's about to get interesting."

anxiety,depression,380,"the older i get, the worse i seem to be at, i don't know, functioning in general. i used to be really sociable, have plenty of friends, i did well in school, had hobbies and interests - i was weird, but enough people liked me that i didn't think about it. after high school it was like the blinders were taken off and i started to see all these things about myself that i really, really hated. i started struggling a lot in social situations, i flunked out of a really good university, i couldn't hold a job, i gradually lost contact with my friends... i was a mess. but i got back up. it was a little harder than before but i still had enough momentum to keep going. i moved back to my ollet myself become. i think a big part of my problems is that i'm so used to trying and failing that i'm afraid that's the only outcome if i try again. i look at myself and think ""i've given up,"" because i have. i don't want to! but i don't know how to make life work for me anymore. i don't know how to connect with people. i go out somewhere and it's impossible to think or talk clearly through the static in my head that makes me nauseous and stutter and my heart pound. what kind of a life is one where you can't even talk to someone without turning into an idiot or crying after? i can't function like this. i'll never be able to work like this. has anyone overcome a similar situation?"

(this is not an advertisement, just an idea. i don't work for movie pass.) i spoke to my private showing. so maybe if you're like me and love movies, a subscription service may be the thing to help you leave the house. amc theaters also has a subscription service for $20 a month if you can afford that.

none,adhd,740,"some friends thought it would be fun to see sting play and tickets are pricey ($94), but it's kind of a bucket list act that i've always wanted to see. they get added to the cart as $94 + fees per ticket on the ticket selection page, which you would think would come out to be $400 or so at the end for 4 tickets. except when you get to the check out screen next, the tickets are now ""advance admission"" tickets and are $194.00 per ticket, + $15.50 service fee, + 4.75 order fee, + shipping because you cannot actually print them at home. the total is now $842.75 for 4 tickets that when you go to buy them says $94 per ticket + fees. so the ""advance admission"" must be adding a charge but there is no way to remove it and when you call, you get told the volume of calls is too high for you to talk to an operator so it disconnects. each ""advance admission"" ga ticket is $194! so 4 tickets x $94 = $376 that means that the fees are $466.75! this is outrageous."

depression,bipolar,898,"kinda shitty advice. but i'll start with some backstory. i'm on mobile so forgive me. (this will be kinda rambly) i was diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety disorder after i checked into a psychiatric hospital a few years back, but i always felt as i grew up that something was wrong. when i went to go meet my biological mother (who is very bipolar) when i was 18 things started to click with me that i needed to figure out a way to find meaning. it didn't help that my step-mom was an abusive cunt. so overall i kinda suck at being a person.(still do) anyways, i've struggled with constantly feeling down, and also feeling a whole lotta shit i didn't really understand. because of this i turned to weed and alcohol when i was 15. went through a few phases of drinking hard, but really weed was my poison of choice(still dont think it's bad but that's for another sub). again anyways because of the plant i kinda regained a sense of what it meant to be a healthy functioning member of society, but it was  pay the rent, things get complicated with family, with work, with life. and all of it together makes me wanna opt out. but then i think of leaving him by himself to deal with it himself and what a living hell that would be. even if i cant do much, ill do what i can till i can't. because if i dont that would make me sadder than anything i can ever encounter in my life. my point is that out there there are strong, amazing, incredibly intelligent and driven people, who do this shit alone. while feeling everything. and its heart breaking. my dad spent his life trying to make me feel welcome when every fiber of my being says i don't belong on this earth. the least i can do is gtfo bed and try to do something. even if my battle that day is just to brush my teeth. so that he can see a good looking smile that he made. to make him feel just a little better. that's my part, my mission. thats what gets me up. there are people that can use your help, and you owe it to them. but that s just my opinion."

adhd,bipolar,1019,"the two are actually quite similar, so i would definitely take a look to make sure that you are going down the right path. it is also called ""emotional dysregulation disorder"" and it includes impulsivity, trouble concentrating, and zoning out. rejection sensitive dysphoria can very easily be confused with a borderline's fear of abandonment. you also lack identity, so you cling onto mental illnesses for your identity and tend to lack values, morals, or goals. it basically gives you the emotional intelligence of a 3-year-old, and you lack object constancy. so basically, you are constantly suspicious and worried about a close person's emotions changing when they aren't constantly talking to you or directly in your area."
ptsd,anxiety,1021,ive come to the situation where i have a brand new partner who wants to hold my hand and this is coming to a head for me again. the second this happens i start to cry and they get put off. they ask if im uncomfortable literally every time no matter the person and i have to say no because its not normal. ive tried to muscle through it but the moment the hand holding gets to hand rubbing i cry again and so on. im 19 what do you think i should do? understandably all of my relationships are very short
none,adhd,1026,"okay, hi. so here’s the story. i’m a young drummer girl who’s been playing drums in pennsylvania for 2 years now. earlier today, i walked in to my usual once-a-week lesson. turned out my regular teacher was out and i had a sub. i didn’t know who it was. we started 10 minutes late. at the start, we just chatted for a while, and he asked me a few things about myself. i unfortunately neglected to tell him i had lived in scotland most of my life, which i regret now, as it is an interesting little fact. it was a really interesting chat, and he was talking about how he always preferred female drummers. he started telling me about his band called the hooters, which i vaguely recognized the name of but i wasn’t sure. i didn’t want to say anything. was over. i left, and thanked him again. i waited a little while for my mom to pick me up, and when i got into the car, i told her about my drum lesson. i said he was quite odd but interesting. i genuinely thought what he had to say was very fascinating. then i mentioned that he said something about him being in the hooters. she immediately was shocked. she told me to google the drummer for the quite popular band and turns out, i had just had a lesson with david uosikkinen himself. shook. later found out a friend of mine has him for her regular lessons. she’s quite lucky as he’s a really cool guy to talk to and just generally quite interesting. i hope he teaches me again someday. well there you go. a little story. i doubt anyone cares haha"

ptsd,anxiety,1036,"like it says, something feels wrong. i can taste in my mouth that something isn't right. it's as if i'm looking at everything through a different light, like my mind is seperate from my body. i feel all these signals going off in my head, that tell me to run and to leave. my brain is filled with all these screaming noises. not voices, not people telling me to do things, but it's as if every thought i have is being screamed throughout my head. i can feel in my chest that something is wrong, it's not anxiety, it's my heart pumping so loud. it feels like something very bad is about to happen."

adhd,anxiety,1053,"not sure if anyone else has experienced this, but when i get into a political or race based discussion with someone, or any discussion with moral issues or things people are heavily opinionated about, i hit a mental wall. its like, i have a bunch of thoughts in my head about a topic but they are not fully formed and as soon as someone retorts with a disagreeing opinion, i got totally thrown off track and unable to state my opinion without going back and digging deep into my brain for things that would make sense to say back. it is really frustrating for me because i feel like i'm unable to think past the surface level of things and am unable to express my opinions without being judged due to my inability to stay on topic with coherent thoughts. any advice/thoughts on this?"

bipolar,depression,1468,"i've been depressed for two months now, and panic attacks and prolonged crying jags from this week that have left me very depleted. this time around i'm feeling just so isolated. all of my close friends are in relationships, so they don't have much time to give me extra support. i understand that i can't be a priority for my friends and family all of the time, but a text checking that i'm ok every once in a while would go a long wacticing piano and reading, and today i even cooked for myself; but i'm just so tired. life is gray right now and it's hard, and trying to bring myself out of this depression feels almost impossible. i know it'll pass...i'm just not sure when, and waiting for it to lift is painful. i want my life back, dammit. sorry for the length and self-pitying nature of this post; i just needed to get this off my chest. thanks for reading &lt;3"
anxiety,depression,1469,"so i managed to do my first proper run just now, and my mind feels so clear i almost can't believe it. just wanted to share! stay strong you guys! &lt;3"
anxiety,adhd,1472,"i can't sit still when i get my eyebrows done, and when i'm in class i usually doodle to focus. i pay attention very well in school regardless of that, and drawing helps me focus."
adhd,depression,1473,"i’m so glad to be a part of a community that understands. just reflecting on my (first ever!) cake day about how happy i am to have found reddit, and more specifically, this sub. lots of you have given me amazingly helpful advice that has genuinely changed the way i experience my life. i’d still be feeling very lost and isolated if i hadn’t found this place. i finally feel more like a person. love you all. drink some water and unclench that jaw! i hope you all have a wonderful day (~:"
anxiety,ptsd,1479,"i constantly feel like i’m being lied to. i overanalyze things, my brain always finds a way to twisted things people say so it seems like a lie. my head hurts and i often cry. things started to feel like this since i was being cheated on 6 years ago."
none,anxiety,1486,"basically i commented on something in a group chat and a girl replied “mood”. now i know that means “i feel the same”, i’m just wondering if i need to reply to that somehow? if i don’t say anything would it be awkward?"
ptsd,bipolar,1487,"i’ve tried celexa, wellbutrin, and zoloft with no luck due to how hard i was hit by the side effects. i was told that since i’ve had three failed attempts, my insurance would cover a dna test to see which meds i’m most compatible with but i needed something in the meantime. yesterday, in a bit of a funk, i went to my local head shop and bought a new vape and a bottle of 1200mg cbd juice, and- holy shit- the difference! this has changed everything in less than 24 hours and i am so humbled and grateful at the peace i’m finally getting. 🙌🏼"
