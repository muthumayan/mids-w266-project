depression,adhd,1,"- keeping the appointment with the dentist, because tooth pain sucks, even though all you really want to do is stay in bed - scheduling an appointment for the root canal you need, even though the mere thought of the procedure has you quaking in your boots - paying the bill that's ten days late for no reason other than you couldn't bring yourself to task on the day it was due - taking the car to the shop because the check engine light has been on for weeks and the inspection is due at the end of the month - doing all of the above and still not feeling proud of yourself or accomplished because there are a hundred other small things you're avoiding or flat out ignoring just to keep from feeling like your life is spiraling down the drain. who the hell let me adult."
adhd,none,2,i just got finished with an interview and as the boss was walking me to the door he asked me what kind of music i listen to. i had absolutely no answer. i listen to music every single day. i listen to new bands and artists every day. but yet i don't know what i listen to. i can't recall names or bands or songs or artists or anything. i love all genres too. i just know that when i turn on my spotify playlist something i enjoy will play. anybody else have this? i can listen to an album 100 times and not know what the album name is or what my favorite song off that album is called. it's so frustrating talking to people about music because i can't recall anything.
adhd,depression,4,"while most people i know can barely muster a tired smirk, even the lamest ones keep me snorting forever. just saw someone here say ""copypasta"" and it had me rolling for minutes. and i'm actually in a horrible mood."
ptsd,depression,6,i really need some support i’m feeling over the edge semi suicidal because i feel like i’m failing at everything. i can’t even make friends. maybe i am just a bad person. maybe everything my ex ever said was true. i just feel like such a failure and just have no enthusiasm to keep fighting. need some encouragement. i have no one.
anxiety,adhd,12,"for trying your best. for making the phone call. for answering the phone. for not staying at home. for putting in the effort. for trying something new. for reaching out. for asking for what you want. for taking a risk, any risk at all. it may seem like a failure today, but these little experiences will pay dividends in your future. don’t give up!"
adhd,bipolar,17,"hey everyone, can we talk about a serious topic for a moment? i want to hear the community's experience on masturbation and medication. **is anybody else experiencing porn addiction or extremely long fap sessions that are hard to stop early?** --- my story: i've always had some elements of porn &amp; masturbation addiction but it never got out of hand (pun intended) nor did it ever affect my life. i wouldn't have  way to overcome it or mitigate it, but failed. this week i've started nofap since my own personal measures didn't work. if i can't fix it myself by the next time i see my psych, it's too serious for me not to tell him about all this. --- **am i the only one that experiences this? do you guys have any similar experiences?** thank you for your thoughts or anything at all. i just ask that you keep it serious. thanks."
bipolar,anxiety,18,"i was offered a full-time job recently and turned it down due to mental health concerns. time has passed, i've had time to consider things further, and my circumstances regarding treatment and therapy have changed. the hr rep who called me said that, if i change my mind about the position, all i have to do is reapply. openings are frequent. today i got notice of another opening and reapplied. i feel confident about taking this on at this point in my life. yes, a crap ton of stuff is going against me. but i feel like i can do this. for once, i'm taking that chance. as my best friend says, watch this space. it's about to get interesting."
depression,bipolar,22,"kinda shitty advice. but i'll start with some backstory. i'm on mobile so forgive me. (this will be kinda rambly) i was diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety disorder after i checked into a psychiatric hospital a few years back, but i always felt as i grew up that something was wrong. when i went to go meet my biological mother (who is very bipolar) when i was 18 things started to click with me that i needed to figure out a way to find meaning. it didn't help that my step-mom was an abusive cunt. so overall i kinda suck at being a person.(still do) anyways, i've struggled with constantly feeling down, and also feeling a whole lotta shit i didn't really understand. because of this i turned to weed and alcohol when i was 15. went through a few phases of drinking hard, but really weed was my poison of choice(still dont think it's bad but that's for another sub). again anyways because of the plant i kinda regained a sense of what it meant to be a healthy functioning member of society, but it was  pay the rent, things get complicated with family, with work, with life. and all of it together makes me wanna opt out. but then i think of leaving him by himself to deal with it himself and what a living hell that would be. even if i cant do much, ill do what i can till i can't. because if i dont that would make me sadder than anything i can ever encounter in my life. my point is that out there there are strong, amazing, incredibly intelligent and driven people, who do this shit alone. while feeling everything. and its heart breaking. my dad spent his life trying to make me feel welcome when every fiber of my being says i don't belong on this earth. the least i can do is gtfo bed and try to do something. even if my battle that day is just to brush my teeth. so that he can see a good looking smile that he made. to make him feel just a little better. that's my part, my mission. thats what gets me up. there are people that can use your help, and you owe it to them. but that s just my opinion."
ptsd,bipolar,27,i've seen three different doctors and none of them will give me my meds. i'm literally getting to the point i will just buy the pills off the internet and risk going to prison just to function. they keep trying to tell me there are other meds that help that aren't addictive. why do they keep telling me this fucking lie and why the fuck do they believe it!!! i guess i'll just drink to function because that's what these people fucking want. i want to strangle these fucking doctors.
bipolar,adhd,28,"i’m in a good place in my life right now, and i finally found a good balance of medicine and therapy, etc. but i keep getting paranoid that people around me are going to wake up one day and dislike me or want to hurt me. i know that logically, most people (especially the people i surround myself with) are very upfront about their feelings. they’re all very caring and they love me. and if they have an issue with you, they’ll talk to you about it. but because of my unmedicated days, and the days where i felt like i didn’t have quite so much control over my impulses or thoughts or feelings, i’ve convinced myself that everyone has trouble with that. and that someday, they’ll all leave in the same way that i walked out of people’s lives in the past. it makes it really hard to form meaningful relationships sometimes."
depression,ptsd,35,"i’ve been feeling pretty depressed over the past 2 weeks, usual symptoms, might go to the doctor to check it it. anyways, i was wondering if it is normal for me to cry when i feel sad, i’ve heard a lot about only girls being allowed to cry and boys online being allowed to be angry or gritty or some bullshit. i get urges to cry everyday, no matter how the day turns out, from 9-4am i am sitting on my bed listening to my music while crying a lot."
ptsd,depression,51,"i know that's a very ""wtf"" topic title, but weird times call for weird celebrations. just googled him for the first time in eons and found new news articles. now i'm just sitting here laughing at how thoroughly he's fucked up his life. probation violation :) actually, twelve of em, but who's counting? **he has** ***nothing*** **left**. he has forfeited a high-paying licensed career, almost a decade of life outside prison now, his well-kozen lives is probably never going to be happy again. :) *was it worth it, my good bitch? would you make the same life choices and still be a degenerate piece of shit...or do you regret it a lil by this point?* i'm just so fucking jazzed at this news. that violent waste of oxygen can eat shit and taste his own karma. **may all the terrible people in your life end up ruining their own lives with their gratuitously awful decisions too :)**"
depression,bipolar,55,"i've had depression for a little over 10 years. gone through many meds, many therapists, many life changes, and many habits. i have an arsenal of things i know help my depression from personal experience: talking a scenic walk outside, eating well, exercising (cardio, weightlifting, yoga), going to social events to mingle with new people, keeping in touch and hanging out with old friends, maintaining good relationships at i know what i have to do yet my mood makes to so hard for me to actually do basic, easy things to keep myself happy. it's like having a map to a new vacation spot where you'll be finally satisfied. but your car is almost always broken down for some reason. so to get there you have to manually tow it for mile in the mud. and you see the other cars effortlessly whizzing by you and you just want to go back home and quit."
depression,bipolar,58,"i'm on the long long road to recovery and the past few months have been comparitively really stable and happy for me. i don't cry nearly as often, i'm much more productive, and much more hopeful. but the second i do something wrong or encounter an issue, especially if someone's mad at me, i immediately jump back to thinking about suicide. it sends me into this spiraling panic that i'll never fix myself and be ok, until suicide feels like the way out. my mom was just screaming at me a lot yesterday and i was so close to just ending it right there, even though i know i don't really want to, and i know i'm gonna be in a better place in just over a month (going back to college)."
anxiety,adhd,60,"after coming home from a nye party where i was strangely pleasant when i sobered up, aka no hangover headache or anything, i had such a nice day traveling home. now two days later i've been sitting in front of my pc a lot since i got home and just before i went up to get some bread and i could feel the discomfort of anxiety again. i'm reminded that inactivity actually creates a lot of tension in the body. i was listening to some music and being by myself i unabashedly made a silly hand gesture to the rythm and i could feel a kind of release from the sense of tenseness. it's just a reminder for all of us i think. it's pretty darn constructive to move your body properly every once in a while if you're usually not very active. whenever the snow passes i want to start jogging again :)"
anxiety,depression,64,"so the title sums it up. i'm almost 28, all my friends are engaged, married or have a clatter of children. i have never even had a boyfriend in my life. i've had ""friend with benefits"" who in reality were not friends and have not benefitted me. i can see now i was used a practice girl before they moved onto women they actually care about. i have social anxiety and hate myself so expect others to hate me too. things like eye contact are very difficult. i use alcohol as a tool to try and be fun but it never really works out. not e first time in my life, he dumped me before i got that far. i'm not angry, i don't blame him, he just didn't feel the same way i do. it's left me absolutely broken. i believe im not good enough for anyone and don't see the point in going on anymore. i just go through the motions every day without feeling anything. i am on meds and see a doctor regularly but nothing helps. i tried counselling and could not talk. i have a history involving suicide and sexual assault and so trust is hard for me. i don't know where to go from here."
ptsd,depression,72,"i've been like this for 8 or 9 years now, life is just sort of grey, no joy or anything (except negative emotions like anger and depression, but never positive ones). i never had much of a social life, let alone a romantic one, and it doesn't even bother me, but that's the problematic part, before the traumatic events i was outgoing and always craved a connection with others, but now i don't feel the need for any of it. is there a way out?"
anxiety,none,78,"1. despite the buffoon serving as the american president, there are other elected officials and higher ups whose voices matter too. despite the words coming out of his mouth, he doesn't have a giant dashboard of buttons he can shoot missiles out of. stop watching so many movies. 2. war is costly. nobody wants it, and all tas previously threatened both guam and hawaii, and is no stranger to threats. worse situations have happened in the past. just to list a few: the cuban missile crisis, the cold war, etc. and yet we are all still here. while the situation isn't a good thing, you and your friends will be fine. carry on with your daily lives."
bipolar,anxiety,79,"came across this and thought they may be useful for anyone suffering from mild depression: does anyone religiously do cbt and if so did it help? **common cognitive distortions** a partial list from robert l. leahy, stephen j. f. holland, and lata k. mcginn’s [*treatment plans and interventions for depression and anxiety disorders*] (2012) 1. **mind reading** you assume that you know what people think without having sufficient evidence of their thoughts. “he thinks i’m a loser.” 2. **fortune-telling** you predict the future negatively: things will get worse, or there is danger ahead. “i’ll fail that exam,” or “i won’t get the job.” 3. **catastrophizing** you believe that what has happened or will happen will be so awful and unbearable that you won’t be able to stand i feel now,” or “my parents caused all my problems.” 10. **what if?** you keep asking a series of questions about “what if” something happens, and you fail to be satisfied with any of the answers. “yeah, but what if i get anxious?,” or “what if i can’t catch my breath?” 11. **emotional reasoning** you let your feelings guide your interpretation of reality. “i feel depressed; therefore, my marriage is not working out.” 12. **inability to disconfirm** you reject any evidence or arguments that might contradict your negative thoughts. for example, when you have the thought i’m unlovable, you reject as irrelevant any evidence that people like you. consequently, your thought cannot be refuted. “that’s not the real issue. there are deeper problems. there are other factors.”"
ptsd,anxiety,80,"every since i was sexually assaulted, i'm scared of wearing shorts or tank tops and even when i'm wearing a sweater lifting up my arms and exposing my sides gives me anxiety. i'm very concerned because of living in a very hot state, i'm a generally self conscious person so i had a hard time last year with not wanting to take my shirt off at the pool, not wanting to wear tank tops but now even wearing t shirts or shorts gives me anxiety. does anyone else experience this or am i alone? i don't know what to do. i'm male btw."
none,adhd,85,"i'm feeling very discouraged. i have a fever, sore throat and cold and my bunk mates and i confirmed we have bed bug bites this morning. the hostel confirmed it and now i'm hanging around waiting for my stuff to wash instead of going to malbrok castle. any suggestions on what to do with my bag, purse and electronics? my bag was on my bed and my purse sat there a bit. my electronics also touched it. i didn't find any signs on my bed but i did get bitten. not sure if the washing machine will fit my bag. i have only been on this trip 4 days and while the travelling has been amazing, bed bugs and sick to start off with has been horrible."
depression,anxiety,86,"you want certian people to always be there for you but they just can't be. they're busy and have their own lives. or maybe they just don't understand how much you're going through, or maybe they don't care too much. i don't know. i get really attached to people at times and constantly wish to be around them and talk to them. i just wish i had a best friend i guess. someone who constantly checked up on me and actually maybe showed concern for my well being. i just want to spend time with someone my age who actually also wants to hangout with me, and not just me wanting to hangout with them."
none,ptsd,89,"we'll show them what a real ""abuse of power is"". hit them in the pocket books. all we have to do is not go see any movies, buy any movies, rent any movies, etc. show them what happens when you piss off the internet. lets make this weekend the officiall ""mpaa blackout""!"
anxiety,bipolar,94,"i just got hired for a job that pays pretty well, and the hours are well-suited for me, working about 4-6 hours per day, and i am super happy about it because i quit many jobs because of its long hours, and i hope this one last and that i wouldn't have any attacks at work!"
bipolar,anxiety,96,i got a cat almost a month ago. i got him because cats have been shown to help with anxiety. his favorite thing to do was to lay on my chest and purr while knocking my phone out of my hand to have me pet him. i looked forward to coming home every day to him. i made sure to put him first and always snuggled him to show him how much i loved him. but he kept getting sick. it finds out he had an incurable autoimmune disease. notice how everything is in past tense? that's because i had to put him down an hour ago. i don't understand how life has given me this many hardships in my life and especially 2 days before my birthday. all i wanted to do was spend it with him. i really do not know what to do. i'm just really sad.

depression,anxiety,111,"i have somebody in my life now. a few months ago i posted about having nobody to talk to. well, last week that changed. during school, (hs btw) i was sitting in class doing nothing. deadpan as ever, when this girl in front of me just turns around and start talking to me. i was caught off guard. i haven't had a loose, non structured, conversation with a stranger for a very long time,. a girl even moreso but i talked to her, let my guard down for a minute and really had a good time talking to this stranger. after the class, we parted ways. i was extremely happy. talking to somebody after all this time has really helped wifh my self worth issues. the fact that somebody just talked to me out of the good of their heart is very foreign to me. now, we talk periodically, and i feel human for the first time in a long time. wish me luck, guys."
depression,adhd,112,"anyone else? i have difficulty sometimes even answering a comment on my own threads (when i make them), and **this** thread took me 3 times to write, as did the last comment i made. :|"
anxiety,bipolar,113,"yes. you. the person reading this right now. you're amazing. i'm telling you because you probably don't hear it as much as you deserve to. because you're battling some really tough things that most people won't ever understand. because even though you're doing that, and it's hell, you're still here. i don't know if you realize what a major accomplishment that is, but i'm here to tell you, it's fucking incredible. you're incredible. keep fighting. keep going. it's going to be okay. i know it doesn't feel like it sometimes (or a lot of the time), but it really will. you're going to have glorious moments of sunshine to make all this rain worth it. those moments are going to see you through the storms. because there will be storms. maybe you're in the storm right now. you'll get through it. because you're strong, stronger than you think you are. you're incredible and strong, and i know you can do it. i have faith in you. i'm here for you. you. are. amazing."
none,bipolar,116,"basically i commented on something in a group chat and a girl replied “mood”. now i know that means “i feel the same”, i’m just wondering if i need to reply to that somehow? if i don’t say anything would it be awkward?"
bipolar,adhd,118,"so i have been working my ass off the past 2 1/2 years to get my head back together and take a bunch of classes i needed for education endorsements so i could get into masters in teaching program. i just found out i got into the program!!! wooo i'm going to grad school! 3 years ago i could barely get out of bed, this spring i'll be learning to teach at an excellent school and i just felt like sharing with people who would get how big of a deal this is to me. i am so happy."
depression,bipolar,122,"i'm pretty sure it's the only thing that's keeping me alive, maybe not alive, but wanting to occasionally live. it's an escape, whether playing or listening. i'm glad i have it, but it's also scary to be so reliant on it. i do recordings and write songs, i guess it gives me a sort of purpose. if i do leave, i'll have something that people can look at and listen to as a reminder that i was maybe okay at something in my life."
adhd,depression,123,"i see your, our, struggle. evolution made us this way for a reason. we have a purpose. but it's really fucking hard to find that in this fucked up modern society. imagine. lots of nature(yes the planet has nature). a brand new start. let everyone be free from the wrong kind of responsibilty. let everyone gravitate towards their natural talents and skills, let people be passionate. no schedule. no shaming of bad structure or organisation. ok maybe bring a handful of neurotypicals for the paperwork. yeah i'm in total denial of the world we actually live in. too painful to face the truth."
adhd,depression,129,"**tldr: take less cedits. be less overwhelmed. every part of your life will thank you. you won't be too tired/stressed for hobbies and socialization and your mood will be like you never imagined, and your grades will thank you** i seriously can't believe how much this one thing has helped. my mood is through the roof. i enjoy life, i look forward to doing stuff. i enjoy my hobbies again. i enjoy socializing again. it's incredible. i don't feel overwhelmed by my workload. i feel like i can handle it, so i don't put it off as much. and because i'm not rushing/stressed, i can actually do quality work. i'm getting as and bs in all my classes, which, for an engineering major, is like impossible. i'm not too tired to enjoy my hobbies and socializing. i used to go out maybe once every few weeks because i was just too exhausted after doing my work. i could never keep up with hobbies because, again, after i finished my work all i wanted to do was sleep or go on reddit."
anxiety,ptsd,131,"depersonalization/dissociating is the closest thing i've found to how i feel but not quite. i feel like i'm just floating through my days. like they fade into each other and i'm just trying to get through each one to make it into the next. i feel so unattached to my surroundings/environment, it makes me feel so awful. i don't feel present, but not necessarily in the ""you don't feel attached to your body"" way like depersonalization generally is described, but i just don't feel present. i don't know any other way to put it. i'm physically there and thats about it. i don't feel like i can relate to anyone either, so i don't bother going out of my way to communicate with anyone (say in a class setting) which just adds to the not-present feeling. what is this called, if anything? and what can i do about it? i'm so miserable"
bipolar,depression,133,"so after months of feeling shitty, attempting things, the mh team fobbing me off and being a shell of myself i got my gp to speak to them urgently today. after having to call them back, they said i had an appointment tomorrow lunchtime with a psych nurse which is brilliant. hopefully they can get me back to where i used to be and fast track me an appointment with the psychiatrist. perhaps i'm speaking prematurely as i've not had the appt yet but if you have a change in your mental state please try not to give up, please try and kick your mh services up the proverbial to help you. don't be another statistic, as i was so close to being. wish me luck :) p.s. if anyone needs to talk feel free to comment below &amp; i'll respond. all the best."
anxiety,ptsd,134,"i have a few things bothering me a lot at the moment and very much need some serious advice. when i was 4/5, i was sitting on my dad's lap helping him steer a car into the back yard, i suddenly felt something hard against my backside, he then asked if i could feel it, and i said yes, we then got out of the car. my mum then asks why he had an erection, he tells mum that i was sitting on his lap. she then starts to get jealous and asks what was wrong with her, and they have a small argument before she walks inside, leaving me alone with him. he then asks me to come towards him, win the mirror (which was located directly in front of the mirror), or to just have a chat because he hadn't seen me all day. i would complain to my mum everyday, and she would just say she would talk to him, or even said that i always showered while he was home so i must want him to look at me. these memories have been causing me a great deal of stress, but i'm confused about if they're serious, and if i should be worried about them? i have two young daughters myself now, and i'm worried about their safety around my parents. am i overreacting or do i have something to worry about?"
anxiety,adhd,138,proper hydration by keeping a track of how much water i drank and setting a target for it actually helped my anxiety subside a lot. its as if proper hydration worked better than some medicines. thought might post this here.i use the water drink app to track my intake day to day.it also calculate's how much water my body needs as per height weight air temperature
anxiety,bipolar,141,"i haven't worked for 3 and half years due to my mental health being so bed that i couldn't face it. i worked in a stressful job but had to quit... my new non stressful, just above minimum wage job starts tomorrow and i am so happy! i don't even care about the money, it's not important at this point. i can't wait to moan about being tired from work and having to make my lunch etc. i am 30 years old and finally my life is getting back on track. please don't ever give up if you're struggling. you will make it out at the other end."
adhd,none,143,"i lack the discipline. * school * video games * learning a language * jobs, jobs, jobs * starting a youtube channel * working out jack of all trades, master of none describes me."
none,adhd,144,"maybe this way of saying it is fine, but when people ask around and compare test scores, i genuinely believe and want to tell people that they shouldn't focus on what other people scored but focus on themselves and their own work. i don't want to sound too formal or even rude since i am a student. so how should i reply to people asking whatever test mark i received?"
ptsd,bipolar,145,"*maria sighed. “it is sometimes easier to be punished for something than it is to be a victim of random cruelty. as long as ingeth can tell herself that her voice was taken from her because she committed some sin, then she has some control of it, you understand? otherwise it was simply a terrible thing that happened. and ihe seventh bride, t. kingfisher* i really struggle with control. i also don't like being a victim, feeling like a victim, or admitting that i did everything i could have. this helped me see a different perspective. i'm still puzzling over this paragraph in a children's early chapter book like an hour after i came across it."
ptsd,depression,148,"i hate this disorder, i hate the people who did this to me, i hate the holidays, i hate knowing that no one is ever really going to actually care. when it comes down to it they just really don't. if i have to be so fucking lonely with this pain then i would rather just actually be alone then. i hate all of this."
ptsd,bipolar,149,"i suffer with schizoaffective disorder and ptsd. i quit drinking in december once i was able to get a glimpse of how unmanageable my life had become. i had no idea how much of the emotions and life i was running away from and numbing. 6 months later and the suffering is so much more manageable and tolerable, but the suffering of getting clean was a bi way of getting my life out of apathy, neglect and numbness and under achieving into a clean slate with all the room and will and tools to achieve. there's more to sobriety than just not drinking i'm realizing and aa is helping me keep on a good path without alcohol while i uncover this new feeling life. i really appreciate the space to vent, thank you"
ptsd,adhd,154,"title says it all. you wanna talk about things you’re experiencing, we all are open to hearing it. but none of us, no matter how long we’ve been in treatment, are certified professionals. we are here to support you. but if you truly want to know, you need to find a counselor and get the necessary testing done. please don’t take this personal. i honestly want everyone to get the help they need. and treatment has made me so much better. i hope you all find the answers you’re looking for."
bipolar,ptsd,155,"someone, seriously help me out here. i've masturbated 3 separate times today, two of which have been in the last hour, i've cum probably at least a dozen time, and i can not get any relief. within 20 minutes of finishing i have that feeling again and its so strain i cant concentrate to to my work. please, any tips for relief are so welcome."
anxiety,ptsd,165,"my wife passed out from a panic attack yesterday in the theatre while we were watching *a quiet place*. i was so scared and didn't know what to do. about an hour into the movie, there's a scene where someone steps on a nail. it wasn't even very gory, but i guess it triggered some bad memories for her. a few seconds after that scene, my wife's arm started twitching kind of like a seizure. at the same time, she started making sounds like she was snoring or maybe choking. when i looked at her, her head was lolled to the side and her eyes were closed. not realizing what was happening, i nudged her a bit, thinking she had fallen asleep. when her head rolled to the other side and there wasn't any other response my concern sky-rocketed. i took her head in my hands and gently shook her a little bit trying to wake her up. her eyes partially opened, and i could see her pupils were looking up like when you roll your eyes. there was no other response. i tilted her head forward and the ""snoring"" sound stopped, but she was still unconscious. at this point, about half a minute or so had passeder feel safe. i tried to just hold her and comfort her. after about a half hour she was doing better. i felt so helpless when she was unconscious. it's very scary when you suddenly realize your loved one is having a medical emergency. later in the evening, she revealed to me that when she was a teenager, she had an abusive boyfriend that would rape her, cut her with a scalpel, and poke her with needles. sick stuff like that i guess. she wouldn't say much more about it than that. i am angry. not at her, but at the thought some sicko did this to her. and i hurt. i grieve that she has experienced something so traumatic it causes this type of thing. she agreed we will get her into some therapy. she needs healing that i never knew she needed. i also know this isn't about me, but i feel a bit hurt this is just now coming out. we've been married about 5 years, and i never knew this stuff. what else don't i know? i don't know what type of advice i'm looking for. how can i be there for her? how can i help? what do i do if this happens again? did i do the right thing both during and after?"
depression,bipolar,172,"i should be cheerful, i should be smiling but i'm not. never thought i could be loved again, especially not now but here i am. like many others i want to love back but there is this force holding me back ever so strong. i don't know what to do. i feel somewhat better and i can sleep again but i know that i will drag her down with me. i'm so lost, i have no control, i'm just like scrap metal in floating in space. i'd appreciate any advice on how to go on with this.. i'm not sure if this is a rant or just venting but i just thought i share my thoughts. edit: thank you all for the replies, i didn't expect anything like this! perhaps give a minute of your life and enjoy eden, it helps when i feel down."
ptsd,anxiety,174,"at 7:23pm my dad passed away five years ago today. i have been on edge all day. sneaking off to the walking fridge to cry when i don’t have too many tickets in the window. sunday’s are always hard because of brunch. staff and guests are always trying. i needed a moment and my boss told me to deal with it. i’m trying ok. i really am but there is a lot i didn’t get to say to him and a lot he didn’t get to do. he was an amazing scientist. it’s part of what killed him. he wanted to do a lot more work and research into diseases and the blood/brain barrier. but his lab forced him to retire early and he took it personally. he made the test for aids/hiv, hepatitis a,b, and c, west nile, and chagas’ disease. i just want to tell him i love him one last time..."
depression,bipolar,184,"i am a horrible friend. i have a lot of trouble controlling my mood and when things are bad i'm cranky. i get mad over trivial things because....idk...maybe it's easier to be like that then admit how much everything hurts for no fucking reason. i also vary between very needy and extremely avoidant. i'm super flaky with plans, but i get really upset when other people are like me. i fucking hate myself. no wonder i'm lonely. no one should have to deal with me."
depression,bipolar,187,"i was putting dishes in the sink this morning so i could wash them before going to work. my phone goes off in my pocket. it's my mom. my heart drops. my grandma's health has been declining for the last year and we've had a few scares where she's close to death. so, naturally i think that my grandma had passed. no, it was the sheriff. my heart drops even farther now. oh god, who is it? he says eric lastname had passed away this morning. he went for a walk and someone found him dead. at this time, i'm just in shock thinking this is some fucked up dream. eric has been my step father for the last 21 years. we butted heads from the start, but he kept me straight and pushed me to do better. i would hate to see where i would be if it weren't for eric being in my life. i could only imagine that i would be living on the streets, or dead. eric and i have receeal getting there. i'm about to head out in a few minutes to go see her. this is the worst thing that could happen now. eric was taking care of finances for my grandma since she's in hospice and their own finances. so now she'll have to take care of her house and land, plus my grandma's land. we don't expect grammy to live for another 6 months or so. so, that gives us a bit of time to think, but i know my mom is going to be devastated for quite some time. i'm ok at the moment, but i know i'm going to be pretty fucked up about this for a long time. i love that man as a father. he was someone i could look up to. someone who would give you the shirt off of his back, or meet me half way between cities to give me money we desperately needed. i miss that man. i may need to call my doctor to get my antidepressants upped. i don't deal with death well at all."
depression,adhd,196,"like you're put on the spot, and suddenly feel this pressure to sound interesting because you realize how boring your routine must appear to a third party. suddenly realizing you spend 70% of your time aimlessly browsing the same 10 subreddits, watching porn, getting high, over-sleeping, and contemplating whether it makes sense to leave your room and show your face to the public. i'm fortunate to have maybe 1-2 days per week where i can gather the energy to participate in a productive activity, and i'll try to talk that up as much as possible before the facade cracks. maybe they'll realize one day that i've never actually finished any project in which i've expressed interest. i already know that i will like myself a lot more, have better conversations, and more fulfilling relationships if i can just manage to flip this balance of time."

anxiety,ptsd,204,"i quit my job today. it was fucking terrible. not quitting, but being there. from september, i've had the worst time working there and trying my best for an abusive relationship. it took every fiber of my being to go through with it, but i feel like i've shed a ten ton husk. long time lurker, but i had to make an account to post this."

ptsd,anxiety,209,"i'm diagnosed with schizophrenia, but psychiatrists also tried out adhd, aspergers/autism, dissociative identity disorder, anxiety, major depression, etc etc you get the picture. my psychiatrist is now convinced that i have ptsd, and whether or not he's right about that, there is something traumatic in my past that caused me a lot of pain and coincided with suicide attempts and illicit drug use. but i don't know what happened. i'm generally aware that my family life wasn't good growing up, i know i was unhappy as a kid, but most of what i ""remember"" from earlier than 18 is actse the moment i try to relax, i lose control of my emotions. even mundane memories of walking to school or what my bedroom looked like sends me into a panic or makes me feel like i'm about to cry and throw up. i feel so disgusting and awful anytime i touch any memory from earlier than 18. i know that i couldn't handle it when it happened, and i feel like it'd just destroy me again if i remembered. but this is clearly still affecting me in terms of anxiety and stress, and i can't fix those until i fix the cause. what if trying to fix this just sends me spiralling out of control?"
anxiety,adhd,212,it happens to me all the time like if i’m taking a training class even if it’s like a day or two long or somewhere i have to go by myself like a scheduled event that i know is coming up i get super excited like a day or two before but the day of then i get nervous.
adhd,bipolar,214,"i just thought it was funny that drugs are doing the exact opposite of how these people are implying it in this situation. i tend to argue with a wall of text for something that barely matters for me, likely so i can get my talking fix and 'cause it's stimulating."
anxiety,adhd,221,"whenever i sit at my desk i think of all the things i enjoy doing / should be doing (which includes hobbies) like reading, writing, journaling, studying language, and i am paralyzed by the decision. i try and weigh it up by things like 'well i haven't done this one in the longest time' or 'this one is most enjoyable' or 'this one would be easiest to get ""done""'. but i can't decide. and treating my hobbies like tasks is a terrible attitude. i spend all this time trying to find the objective best choice of way to spend my time that i waste that time, don't get anything done, and don't enjoy it. i'm too worried of making the 'wrong' choice. i have to keep reminding myself to stop prevaricating and just pick one and who cares about weighing factors or making practical choices. just choose one! but it's hard."
bipolar,depression,227,"i'm so bored with my life. everything i do does not give me any satisfaction whatsoever ex: trying to be social, reading, watching movies etc. i just can't pay attention nor do i really want to. all i ever want to do is sleep because i'm so bored... been sleeping about 14 hours in total each night/day. i know i am in a severe depressed phase right now but i used to cry and feel emotions... now i just lay in bed, try to watch movies etc (can't sit through anything) and wait until i can go back to sleep. it's really sad actually ... that being said, i am a college student who is failing two classes because i really do not care to go to class because i can't even pay attention there so i feel like its a waste of time. does anyone ever feel this way? i know what depression is like but being absolutely emotionless is new... i don't really know what to do"
adhd,depression,228,"i don't know how to best explain this feeling i have all the time, but extreme boredom comes kinda close. dissatisfaction with everything. i often hate my life so much, because i feel like i'm never satisfied by anything. i never feel truly happy, truly stimulated, by daily life. waking up, walking dogs, school, work, watching tv, eating, going to bed; it's a continous loop that makes me so very sick. i crave more, and because i don't have the motivation to go find more exciting things i just feel like i could might as well be dead. i'm so bored, so disappointed, so unmotivated, that lying down and just dying seems like a good alternative. what do i even do about this? help."
anxiety,depression,230,i had a little numbness on my left side of my chest now im kinda bugging out while at work. and i cant stop thinking about it just want to know if thats normal for anyone. edit thank you all for your responses glad to know im not the only one feeling this way. i hope that you all can feel a little better.
anxiety,adhd,231,"hey all, i've noticed recently that i've been putting things where they don't belong, or opening cabinets to look for things that i know are in another cabinet. i'm 20. sometimes i'll be walking and i'll have to ask myself ""where am i even walking to?"" then i have to think about what time it is and what day it is and say ""oh, i'm going to english class."" or sometimes i'll be sending a text and something else will happen and i'll put the phone down only to open it up later and realize i never sent the text. appointments slip my mind constantly or i'll remember that i never went somewhere i was supposed to and then think about it and think ""wait, yes i did do that/go there."" it's really scaring the shit out of me. anyone else have these types of memory lapses?"
adhd,bipolar,232,i have an issue with balance. i never know when i'm on the path to burnout until i get there because i don't know how to differentiate between pushing through for discipline or pushing myself past my limits. does that make sense? does anyone have advice?
bipolar,depression,233,"ugh, i hate how this time of year means increased social pressure. i hardly have the energy to socialize to begin with, but add all this holiday stuff on top and it wears me the hell out. went to a christmas tree decorating party this afternoon and after an hour i started fantasizing about announcing ""i have a mental illness so parties are very draining to me ... so ... yeah ... thanks so much, but i have to go now."" i did manage to last a couple more hours but now i'm soooo tired. thank heavens my husband understands."
bipolar,depression,237,"i've noticed a theme in my negative thoughts about myself in the last year has been a focus on this idea that i'm a failure. it's something i think all too many of you can relate to, and something i hereby challenge you to do with me. i'll do it in the comments so it doesn't overshadow your accomplishments (because i want to hear about them and be proud of you!) or turn into nk of other things i've done i can be proud of, and maybe it'll help us see some of the awesome things you've done in life that you might not appreciate for its level of awesomeness. so...what in life was hard for you that you managed to do anyway? what was something you did that's been hard for other people that wasn't hard for you? what've you worked at? stay awesome, folks."
ptsd,bipolar,241,"i am so tired of fighting. this illness has taken everything from me. i’ve fucking tried the self help books, ive tried therapy, i’ve tried emdr, i’ve tried meditation and mindfulness, i’ve tried sobriety. everything just keeps getting worse. and now i lost the only thing i fucking care about. i right this at 5am with tears in my eyes, not being able to sleep. she left almost 3 weeks ago. she couldn’t take being with me anymore and i really don’t blame her. i was with her for 5 years on and off, she was my high school sweetheart and the only girl i’ve ever loved, my best friend and the only person i felt who truly understood me. ever sense then i’ve basically spent every waking minute, using drugs, finding drugs, or buying drugs. i’m fucking done guys. i give up. i’m done trying i’m done pretending things get better, i’m done trying to pull my pathetic ass out from the dirt. thanks for being such a great community over the years. throw away account for obvious reasons"
adhd,anxiety,242,i am line cook at a grill&amp;bar restaurant making minimum wage &lt;-- which sucks ass. i am tired of working in the restaurant industry after long hours and shitty pays. time for me to book an appointment with my psychologist (i haven't seen my psychologist since last year) and go to college for a better life.
anxiety,depression,248,"tomorrow i bury my best friend who tragically passed away at the age of 25. i'm heartbroken and i will be speaking at his funeral. i am happy with the speech but i am nervous, petrified to mess up. he was an incredible guy and i want to send him off well, justify what he meant to me. my ex who broke up with me 2 months ago has kept contact to ask how i have been doing and if i ever needed anything go to her. i went to the gym yesterday evening just to pass the time and maybe work off a small hangover i was nursing from the night before. i felt okay but by the end of my session i was very tired. as i was walking back towards my flat i spot my ex with a guy next to her sitting down. i could have turned around but i didn't. i go up to her and say hi, she seems shocked to see me and asks if i'm doing okay. i say no, not really and say i'll leave them to it and say goodbye. as i walk down the road my ex has caught up with me after she runs to catch up with me. she says she has done this to tell me thatuy who has a family that makes her laugh, feel alive. this guy has a child. i recognise him from her xmas party. i'm really confused about why she chased after me. it's obvious she cares but is she feeling guilty, trying to spare my feelings in the hardest time of my life. i do want her back in my life but seeing her with another guy hurt big time. seeing them close to each other eating ice cream. she works with him, did she like him when we were dating. i also hate the idea of her sharing her sympathy and support with other people, especially a guy like that. and it hurts to hear her say to me he's going through a hard time. i'm going through the hardest time of my life. i feel like i can't use her as a crutch. i'm so confused, hurt, a mess. i bury my best friend tomorrow . i am absolutely terrified. i feel sick, like i'm going to mess up and ruin everything. the last 2 months has been the worst of my life, it just has. i want things to be better. i want him back. i want her back. i feel terrible."

ptsd,bipolar,258,"just, come on, universe! really? this therapist saved my life, i owe everything to her, but now i have to watch her go through chemo and radiation completely helpless to do anything. she assures me it's not severe, that they caught it early, that she expects to make a full recovery. it still sucks balls to walk into the office and see that she's bald and sometimes has a hard time finding words because the chemo fucks with her brain. i'm not looking for sympathy or advice, just a rant because it feels like the one thing in the whole world that i can't discuss with her."

depression,bipolar,273,"sorry if this has been asked before, but i was wondering if anyone knows or has experienced their intelligence deteriorating because of depression (or maybe meds)? i really used to be so smart and understood things easily and now i struggle so much academically and it makes me so frustrated and sometimes brings me to tears the fact that i feel so stupid and i feel like get stupider every year, i can't tell if it's because of my illness (i have chronic depression so i'll be taking meds my whole life) or what. any insight would be appreciated."

bipolar,ptsd,295,"monthly appointment with my doctor again. so i was a little worried about feeling this weird ""not caring"" on some things that i usually do. so i brought it up when he asked, is there anything you want to bring out? i told him that i find it strange when i'm supposed to be angered in a situation and i feel like i don't care anymore. i can't figure out the reason why but i just choose automatically to not care. there are also other aspects but it's more difficult to illustrate. so he asked me, is that good or bad? i replied, that's the issue, i don't know. i'm not sure if it is good or bad. i said maybe imm just tired of being stressed. he smiled and i was surprised when he said, then it's good that you are becoming resilient to daily stress."

depression,anxiety,305,"when you have depression or anxiety aging feels 10 times worse. i’m 21 and i feel incredibly old already. i suppose the worst part is that when you are a kid in highschool people always say that life “gets better” and of course the media really hypes up your early 20s as the best time in your life. i am very socially isolated with no friends. all i do is attend community college and feel like a failure... yet this is the so called “prime of my life?!” i find it depressing that my physical peak is coming and going so quick. i feel like i have no control over time - i constantly worry about how fast it’s passing and i’m not afraid to make life changes due to anxiety. i know , life doesn’t end when you turn 30. but for someone like me who probably never will get married or have kids aging seems hopeless. my body will decompose all while i get forgotten about by the world. hell, being lonely at 21 sucks enough i can’t imagine being lonely and isolated at 40+ ."

adhd,depression,313,thank you to this [wonderful who went waaaay out of their way to try and hurt my feelings but ended up turning a bad day into a good one because it reminded me that some people have it worse. there are people out there who only feel good when they make others feel bad and those are the people to feel truly sorry for. i'm so flattered that they saw me as a target :)

depression,adhd,378,"for the first time in a long career of being a depressed human being, i was told ""it gets better"" un-ironically during an otherwise constructive conversation. it made my face flush and i immediately had the urge to end the conversation. so i did. and now i feel like an ass. the phrase ""it gets better"" doesn't seem terrible at face value. i mean, it really isn't terrible. but i feel as though in past years, at least in the us, there has been a rather prolific ad/psa campaign based around the phrase ""it gets better"". it feels contrived and inauthentic. ier or negative feelings relating to depression/anxiety?** to keep this from being an entirely negative discussion, feel free to add and discuss the aspects of your treatment plan that you've had success with. for me, after years of genuinely perfectionist approach to lifestyle (diet, exercise, sleep), beginning a regime of ssri in the form of lexapro was the first thing that made me feel as though my situation was improving. best of luck, everyone. i just felt as though this was the proper place to share my negative outlook and maybe get some feedback."

bipolar,depression,380,i simply couldn’t handle the monotony and soul crushing nature of an office job for myself....and while that may be true of being a dishwasher it’s at least more mind numbing. i feel like i failed societal expectations and my family’s as well by ending up this way but it truly is the disease. this happen to anyone else? were you able to find contentment in simpler work?
depression,anxiety,383,i make a lot of mistakes and am very awkward so i end up thinking the words “kill yourself” dozens of times a day. it’s like a reflex at this point. i’m not actually going to kill myself but it’s like some subconscious desire bubbling up from deep down. i’m afraid i’ll start saying it out loud or something
bipolar,adhd,403,"i do at times. sometimes i will say ""the splu biders"" or ""tub bath"". reading is fine and easy, not dyslexic at all but the speech is weird. today i forget to take my meds, and found it to be worse than normal (with meds). anyone else experience this?"
ptsd,anxiety,407,"the other day i or i should say we went on a 1st date with a woman i had just met a couple of days earlier. i say we, because my service dog was with me. after we had eaten, we were just chatting when all of sudden my dog jumps up and starts licking me. this is what she does when i start getting amped up. didn't train her to do it, she just does i had to get out of there. i could not sit still. i don't remember everything after the anxiety exploded. i don't remember driving home. i just couldn't think straight. i was short of breath. my heart was pounding. it had been such an amazing date up until that point. has anyone been thru anything similar?"

depression,anxiety,417,"nothing is wrong in particular in my life, i have a couple things that are kinda down. but nothing i can say should be making me have such a bad reaction to it. if you want to know, i have started a new job and part of the job is night shift sometimes... but i know that flip floping day to night makes me very sick, but if i am permanent nightshift it doesnt bother me. i know i can talk to my managers but part of me would rather just find a new job. however i am finding myself thinking even worse than usual about cutting my throat open and bleeding to death. the image in my mind is quite graphic, more so than normal."
bipolar,adhd,419,a little while ago i made a post where i was wondering whether my adhd-like symptoms where caused by bipolar or if i actually have adhd. well i just got back from seeing my old therapist and she says she's 99% sure i have adhd inattentive. she told me to absolutely mention it to my pdoc at my appointment in august. i'm so happy to hear from someone certified that i'm not incompetent. hopefully i can make progress from here. i'm glad for some of the motivation you guys gave me in my original posts. thanks for reading

depression,bipolar,447,lately i was so happy. but then my period came along and i can barely function. it didn't use to be this severe either. the depression is unbelievably bad. i feel so disoriented. home doesn't feel like home. etc.... edit: thanks everyone ❤ i'll talk to my dr to find out if there's something else going on. there's gotta be another way 😪
bipolar,adhd,453,"two months ago i went to my psychiatrist after being stable for a year and asked her for adderall. i made a total fool of myself. what i didn't realize is that i was on a downward spiral. all of my responsibilities have been unmanageable but i didn't realize it. slowly but surely, my mental health declined until it was affecting me physically. i was having acid reflux that was so severe it was making me told me she knew from experience that a person who has been stable asking for a control is a sign they're slipping. she said she knows how hard i work and it's understandable that i need a time out. my doctor gave me eight months, minimum. she will let me have up to 12 months if i need it. i'm going to use this time to completely overhaul my life and get help. it just feels so damn good to be validated."
anxiety,depression,456,"i love to grow flowers, it's pretty much my only hobby and the main way that i de-stress. i have flower beds all around my house and i view my plants as my ""babies."" but last year my emotional support cat passed away at 12 years old and i feel like my soul went with him, it was the worst pain i've ever experienced. in my grief i completely neglected my garden for the whole year. that cat was like furry xanax to me, and now that he's gone my anxiety has been at it's worst. but today i said ""no more hiding"" and i went back outside and weeded the beds, planted some more dahlias and lilies, mulched, and trimmed my roses. i even met the new neighbor without getting nervous and going back inside. now my beloved garden has its life back, and i feel a little bit better. now that i have new things popping up from the ground i have no excuse to ignore them. i hope i can muster up the strength to keep going. for today, i'm proud of myself."
anxiety,depression,461,like i hate it for two reasons because first of all it either emasculating or infantilising. and second it implies that im not doing my best or at the least not trying or sometimes it comes off as someone making light of my feelings.

ptsd,anxiety,680,i've started to use cbd oil to manage my anxiety and i feel like a person again. i have energy to both accept any negative feelings i have and still put out a positivity to other people. which is something i struggle with when my anxiety is fully active since it pulls me down and it's difficult for me not to come off nasty when all my energy is spent fighting anxious thoughts and coping with the feelings it creates. i have an easier time talking myself down from my anxious thoughts and can function better in public in general. i can focus when i read and not forget things because i don't have my brain going a mile a minute. this stuff makes me feel like my life has changed drastically. i'm so grateful it exists.
bipolar,depression,685,"i didn't care to do anything this year. the only reason i bought a cake is because i have a six year old. the only reason i'm posting is because... those younger than me: you'll be 31 one day, too. it gets better. you're worth every minute more of your life. i odied at 16 and struggled with suicidal ideations all throughout my twenties. i have an awesome kid. i decided to ask my fwb to be my bf yesterday and he said yes (wtf.) i am finally getting self discipline down and writing my books. i couldn't even imagine this all before. i've had the ups and downs but today, i am 31, and you'll get here one day, too."
bipolar,depression,696,"you are climbing a mountain, it's hell, you want to give up , you push on and when you finally think you can't take another step, someone passes you on the way back down and tells you it's just 5 more minutes. a grueling ten minutes pass, you collapse on a rock and drop your pack. you see the summit. you lie on the ground for ten more minutes trying to shake out the last drops of water from the bottle into your mouth and they dribble down your face instead. you brought double the water everyone else did and it wasn't enoughiew was beautiful, you should see the view from the peak, it's amazing, so worth the trip, and you go wtf. you know night will come eventually, climbing up that mountain, never reaching the ""summit"", uncertain of how many hours you have left. only that night will come and then the struggle will end. stop making false promises that ""it will get better"". stop asking me to believe in fairytales. i don't want another false hope only to be shattered again like a glass falling to hard floor. i am so tired of picking up the pieces."
adhd,ptsd,697,"every time i get into an argument/ debate i’m either a second away from crying or a second away from an angry outburst. it’s so hard to keep my cool and as a result... i learned to stop talking/ people please/ avoid the topic whenever things got heated. it’s a bad habit. i know this. because it’s a bad habit i decided recently to slowly start facing my fear of arguments/disagreements and the pain is just coming right back. it’s overwhelming. every single attack feels personal. it is so hard to keep my cool, and when i do? i end up feeling like shit for the rest of the day because i feel like i’ve been rejected. everytime i feel rejected i suddenly think everyone is going to abandon me, and i get stuck in that feeling. i’m learning slowly and taking my time... but god does this shit suck!"

bipolar,depression,705,"title says it all. i was bombarded this morning by my boss, essentially belittling me in front of the entire office. i sucked up like the man i am, and sat down behind my desk. and then it hit me. a wave on extreme anxiety and panic. my chest pounded like mad, i began to sweat heavily, the lights hurt my eyes, and my legs began to bounce and shake. i tried holding it back, that pain in the throat that makes it hard to swallow. i almost forgot how that felt. i ran to the back half of the office, stood out in secluded section of the warehouse and wept. granted it was for only about 30 seconds, i haven't felt such relief in so long."

ptsd,anxiety,714,"like it says, something feels wrong. i can taste in my mouth that something isn't right. it's as if i'm looking at everything through a different light, like my mind is seperate from my body. i feel all these signals going off in my head, that tell me to run and to leave. my brain is filled with all these screaming noises. not voices, not people telling me to do things, but it's as if every thought i have is being screamed throughout my head. i can feel in my chest that something is wrong, it's not anxiety, it's my heart pumping so loud. it feels like something very bad is about to happen."

depression,bipolar,800,"word to the wise, if you want to commit suicide don't call anyone for help. they send a fucking ambulance, force you into it by strapping you down, send you to a mental hospital for mandatory 72-90 hours (weekends don't count), drug you up until your delusional and then bill you for the whole damn thing so you're broke and suicidal again. next time i have a gun to my head i'm pulling the trigger, calling for ""help"" makes everything worse."

depression,adhd,807,"it took massive amounts of energy, but somehow i accomplished something today. i woke up just in time before the garbage pickup came. it's so hard just to stay afloat and not stay in bed so these little victories have to count for something. it seems like forcing myself to do everything in the morning will lead to more productivity, it's tough. i remember when i had the energy to do all these things without even thinking twice."

bipolar,depression,847,"so in the title, within quotation marks, are what i've heard from people i spent the most time with. 1) my mom, 2) a now-ex boyfriend, and 3) a former friend. 1) my mom kinda blew up in the parking lot of a hospital. the doctor said i didn't need a cough pill for my infection, and would be fine with only the prescription she gave me, and then my mom asked if she could prescribe me with a cough syrup. the doctor agreed to prescribe a strong cough syrup, and i asked if i don't need a cough pill, ""do i need cough syrup?"" the doctor said no, but said ""the medicines won't react with one another,"" and ""if you want a cough syrup, i can prescribe one."" *but i don't.* my cough won't go away (respitory infection) until the steroids kick in, but it will go away. i don't like taking meds i don't need. i'm defensive about this, because every time i have respitory issues, my mom asks the doc for a cough syrup ""for my own good"" and i feel like shit bc it's got some depressive drug in it, and i feel ultra sluggish the morning after i take it. i don't need it so i'm adverse to taking it. my mom says it's ridiculous that i have a cough and won't take a cough syrup, when no cough syrup was prescribed or suggested. the steroids will take it's course. but mothers will be mothers. i just hate taking drugs i don't actually need. (and i'm 18 so i'd think the doctor would have asked me first. guess not.) anyway she called me ungrateful and wouldn't let me speak and i dunno. it hit me. she said: ""i'm better off dead than i am alive to you, because nothing i do as your mother makes you happy."" i wanted to shoot myself in the mouth right there and then, ngl. i know that isn't the (logical) answer to this, but she isn't the only one who's said stuff like this. 2) my ldr boyfriend of two years broke up with me last night. he says he doesn't feel like he can talk to me, because he says offhanded things, and for a while, i didn't address them until months later (which is toxic). and now he feels that he'll fuck up no matter what he does, so what's the point. in the past i've addressed things as they came up and he either made fun of me, got super defensive, or asked ""so what's the problem?"". for example: he didn't speak to me for long periods of time. for like. a year. cancelled majority of skype dates at the last second. i said that i knew he has other obligations, but that still felt a bit emotionally neglected. (being left on read for days and sometimes weeks, not hearing from him for months, reading an ""i love you, too"" from him was rare. i felt like he didn't like me.) but he said that i had no reason to believe that. he had a roommate who made me cry, and he didn't defend me. even if i say that i didn't appreciate a comment, he would just join him. of course, he didn't mean to be rude, and of course he didn't mean to overlook my crying, didn't mean to misunderstand me. but he refused to buy earbuds because of his ""indispoable income"" (even if he went out to drink once a month). which gave his roommate ammo to be a bully. so i mailed my then-bf earbuds and he lost them. it felt as if he didn't put any effort into the relationship, and was justifying himself. when i asked if he wanted to break up, he sounded surprised and confused as to why. said that he loves me. i wasn't angry, just hurt and confused with all the mixed messages. but i said i believed him and ignored my gut. plus, on holidays, he drives six hundred miles in one go to visit me (and his family. so contrary to what he says, i'm not the only reason he comes to the city i live in.) but he said ""you think i wanna see my family? barely anyone there wants to see me. i'm driving for nine hours straight just so see you. of course i love you."" he gave multiple examples of his responsibilities, asked if i understood, and still asked what the problem is. i couldn't teents to me and to other people. i understand how depression can be; but that doesn't excuse her from being mean. from playing rough and with scissors (as a seventeen year old). from going out of her way to patronize people. but she put on her snapchat story her suicidal thoughts, talking about how everyone she knows is against her. so i swiped up, let her know that i apologize if i wronged her, and that i want her to be okay. that i don't think anyone is against her. that i am here if she needs to talk. she said that i can't make her pity me, and i was baffled. that she doesn't have the energy for my bullshit. (yikes.) that i shouldn't play nice if i don't feel nicely about a person. (still don't know what's she was talking about but it was childish. but still yikes.) and then she said all i do is complain about my family problems and boyfriend and do nothing to fix it. (that was when i said ""good to know,"" and blocked her. hehe.) it's so funny that she *asked me* what's wrong, didn't accept ""nothing"" for an answer, and then secretly hated when i was open and honest. i thought she was my friend. but i guess only therapists are meant to hear your problems. anyway. i digress. days after i blocked her, she came around me in person. went out of her way to sit next to me. acted fearful, as if i would reject her. took every single chance she got to be overly nice. for example: i was presenting and the class (of 13 people) was talking over me. she stood up, cupped both hands over her mouth, and projected: ""everyone! chris is talking! it is important to hear what they say, so that they can finish their presentation!"" sat down, then grinned at me. the class had the same weirded-out expression as i did. like. ugh. that was so artificial that it hurt me. i have a floridan friend who i tell some of these situations with, and he says it sounds like the other person has some unsolved problems of their own. my therapist said the same thing about all three scenarios. that nothing i complain about is like. ""i'm so sad my dad got me a blue car. i wanted a red one."" y'know? like the problems that bother me are literally ""so i'm homeless and don't know where i'm sleeping tonight "" or ""i got 27 spider bites in my sleep"" or ""my mom is threatening to kick me out and i'm an unemployed student"" or something that can't be given advice, because it's totally out of anyone's control. like when my car got totalled and i kept having flashbacks about the crash throughout the day. i couldn't sleep at night. for weeks. or when three of my classmates died. or when i was in a sexually abusive relationship for six months, got assaulted everyday on school grounds, and didn't tell anyone for eight months. i have flashbacks and awful dreams about *that* one to this day. but i don't say anything until someone asks me what's wrong. and even if they do, i'm reluctant to say so. bc none of this can be hugged better. it's heavy. it's uncomfortable and nobody wants to hear it. those are the only things that get to me. those are the things i go to therapy for. but my therapist doesn't believe in dwelling on (talking about) past traumas and griefs. i don't know what anyone wants me to do anymore. do i just let go of *everything*? i do not exagerrate; these things happened in the same twelve months. i'm not trying to excuse my complaints, but, yikes. i don't know what to make of any of this. anyway. tldr: nobody i open up to stick around. are all of these situations like. situations where both parties have made acceptable mistakes in handling their situation? or am i this unhappy person who makes people miserable because i complain so much? am i ungrateful? am i being crazy for saying the things i do? does anyone else hear statements like these from people who see you the most? it's times like these that makes self destructive behavior so easy."
bipolar,adhd,848,"facebook seriously stresses me out. does anyone else struggle with social media? i have a hard time staying connected to friends and family because the things people post can be serious triggers for me. it doesn't matter if i'm upcycling or downcycling, something is bound to either agitate or depress me. sometimes i go on binges of unfollowing people. that doesn't help because then i don't have those connections and my feed fills up with promoted crap thaationships. i have my immediate family, and a couple of close friends (that's funny. i haven't seen them in literally a year and a half) but everyone else is an acquaintance at best. i don't even talk to my mother unless i have to, and that's after we've mended our relationship (as much as possible at this point). i'm not asking for advice, i just want to know that i'm not alone in feeling like this. do others have the same experiences? can you share some?"

anxiety,depression,870,"i constantly feel like i’m being lied to. i overanalyze things, my brain always finds a way to twisted things people say so it seems like a lie. my head hurts and i often cry. things started to feel like this since i was being cheated on 6 years ago."
depression,bipolar,875,"don’t get me wrong , i’m very grateful that i can take care of myself , but i’m still depressed so i think i get at least some leeway to be pissed about this . what i hate is that when you’re high functioning you don’t have an illness to fall back on . it’s like when arthur fleck says “the worst part about having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don’t” . that’s extremely true in all cases but that’s how i feel right now as a high functioning . when you’re not high functioning people see that you’re not okay and the cut you some slack ing . i’ve been depressed for the last four years , but i’m high functioning so is it really valid ? when you don’t feel like cleaning or doing your laundry you’re dirty . when you can’t bring yourself to pick up after yourself you’re dirty . and why’s that ? because nothing is wrong with you and there’s no reason for you to be doing this . they don’t understand depression and it shows . it’s just annoying when you have to be normal like everyone else even though you constantly struggle and nobody sees that . it’s like if it isn’t tangible it just isn’t true !"
adhd,depression,876,...and you still waste your fucking time on your phone and only end up doing some of it at least it's better than nothing but yeah this was me the other day. i stayed up all night at my work to catch up on things that i'm way behind in

depression,adhd,890,"it's getting hard for me to remember a lot of things and my brain is always foggy. i had a job interview earlier and i could have sworn i heard the manager say that *she'll* give me a call this afternoon, and i haven't heard anything from them, and now i'm having a miniature crisis because i don't know if that's what i actually heard or she actually said *tomorrow afternoon* or she said she wanted *me* to call this afternoon or tomorrow afternoon or if i heard her correctly and she just didn't bother to call me and gave the job to somebody else. this is so fucking frustrating, i feel like i can't trust my brain and it makes me feel like an idiot. please tell me meds can fix this..."
anxiety,adhd,895,"i consistently talk to myself. sometimes i will sit down, and have conversations with myself. it's like a back and forth q&amp;a; as my mind wonders off about a curiosity, or uncertainty, i will verbally answer myself, sometimes in great detail. not sure if this is just an inflated ego answering my insecurities, or if this is just normal human behavior. sometimes i compulsively call myself negative names too. like ""idiot"", ""stupid"", or ""loser"". in all honesty, i feel like i only call myself these names to motivate myself to do better next time. however, i'm not sure how helpful it really is."
none,depression,896,most people get relased after 14 years or earlier after commiting brutal crimes like murder . but here is a man who spent 54 years in prison without committing a crime and without facing a trial . the entire system is a joke. god knows how many such people are still in the prsion.
depression,adhd,898,"i'm constantly so angry that i have to do all these things i dont want to do just so i can continue living, which i'm not even interested in doing. i'm angry i'm in a major that i hate and that the fields i was interested in make so little money that the field isnt even worth pursuing imo. i'm angry i'm going to have to work +8 hours a day 5 days a week in a job i dont like, i'm angry that i have to spend my mornings getting ready and driving to a job i won't like. ill get shit benefits and 10 days vacation a year, so for the next 30 years i get to be miserable with the exception of 10 days out of the year when i can travel which is the only thing i'm interested in anymore. probably what makes me the most angry is seeing all these talentless people on youtube making millions for being morons while i have to go to school for 4 years to even make a livable wage and it pisses me off. i get the whole ""life isnt fair"" thing but i can't stop being angry about it and everyday it gets worse."

ptsd,depression,905,"it got to the point where i was ready to start working again. really just to help support my girlfriend, anyway it’s nothing glamorous, movie theatre usher, but getting out of the house has helped a lot. i’m very awkward and antisocial and have made it a point to be friendly and social with my coworkers and i’ve met a lot of people i like. yeah i’m still pretty awkward, but i’ve been my old funny like-able self. feeling pretty good right now, for the first time in along time i feel like a normal person. just thought i’d share."

ptsd,depression,921,"it may be bizarre to say this but ... i cannot think, i cannot feel, i cannot do anything because i am too scared to do anything because i cannot trust anyone because i feel that i am living among a world of sharks, just like in the world of game of thrones. i am too scared of doing anything or even talking to anyone because i feel that everyone will come after me i feel that if i move one step, just one step, and everyone will come at me and eat me alive. i am too scared of doing anything and i feel very gloomy becuase this world, the entire world just fucking scares me. i know that there are probably good people out there and i applaud you for that but just like in the world of game of thrones, the good people always lose because is a messy, messy place that is filled and made up of lies and dirty work because somehow humanity is inherently evil, to this point"

depression,bipolar,945,i just want disappear but i am to scared of the pain of suicide and the meaning which comes with it. suiciding also affects all the people who know you. why did he do that? did i treat him wrong. my parents would probably blame themselves and maybe get suicidal. getting sick in a way that i couldn't be healed and die would be like an escape from this world.
depression,bipolar,946,"my life sucks now and has always sucked. i've always struggled with depression, bipolar and self harm and awful social anxiety. waking up and thinking about all the years ahead, makes me absolutely exhausted in a way that sleep can't even touch. i realized the other day.. i don't wanna be alive, but i also don't want to die. i feel like there's a chance later on, my life could be amazing. a husband &amp; family, a job, ect.. and if i died, i'd never get to experience what i want so bad. so for now, i guess i'll keep doing what i'm doing and hope something changes and just keep hope. anyone else ever felt this way?"
bipolar,adhd,951,"someone reminded me the other day that there’s no cure for this disorder. as someone with a family history of it and someone who has been struggling with it most of my life, i objectively knew that, but i realized that this whole time i’ve been trying to change my medicine for almost a year, my mind has been hopeful for a cure. i have been wanting to cure it, not treat it, but actually be rid of it forever. wow. remembering that there’s no cure really hurts a lot and makes me kinda hopeless."

anxiety,ptsd,965,"i’ve had the worst week of my life. pretty much lost the will to live. my anxiety has been at a all time high since i calmed it down a while ago. as seen via my last post i got sexually assaulted nearly 7 days ago and i’ve been going off the rails ever since. i’ve barely been sober and have been promiscuous which i’ve never been before and i have no idea why after my assault all i want it for boys to respect me and say the right things before any sexual activity occurs. i had a boy say to me he wanted to get to know me before we had sex even though it was a one night stand and if it wasn’t for that nothing would of happened between us. it gave me at the time some false sense of security knowing i’m worth something and i’m not actually just a disposable machine that’s only good for one thing and that’s it? i went out last night and i’ll spare the details as about 5 dknow a few of them don’t like me that’s evident and i’m not sure why because i’ve not personally met any of them that don’t seem to like me, a lot of it has to be because of the guy i used to see and another guy i used to see who was also there. there was also drama as on friday someone slyly took a picture of me with a boy who had his arm around me who has a girlfriend (which i didn’t know) so everyone knows it’s me but they’re only not saying anything because the boy would fight all of them and probably win and his girlfriend showed up and punched him in the face and said he cheated on her, so i was quite a big topic of conversation in that apartment clearly and it’s giving me such bad anxiety i’m just worrying what people think of me and what was said about me i just don’t know what to do... i feel like i need to redeem myself but yet i’ve just done nothing wrong?"

bipolar,depression,973,"i was recently pming with someone about relationships, heartbreak, and feeling broken and picked up on a shared sentiment. that our mental illnesses made us less deserving of love from healthy people. which my rational mind tells me is total bullshit, but it's still a sentiment i have to put effort into rejecting. it's no secret i've been investing serious time into online dating, but i think it's progress on my part that most of the time i don't feel like my mental illness disqualifies me from relationships with healthy people. i still feel like i'll be better understood by people who experience depression and whatnot and like my issues will be less of a burden to someone with their own struggles for me to give back to, but as i was thinking abouto more broken than any ""normie."" *how many of you have struggled to feel like it's okay to have relationships with healthy people, and of those of you who have, what if anything has helped you chip away at that feeling?* as broken as i've felt and as flawed as i've been, i've never been broken and i've never stopped being worth loving. there have been things about me that have made it harder to love me, like my former bmi of nearly 40 as a barrier to that kind of attracted attention, but even then i was sometimes shown that kind of love. **however broken you may feel and however unlovable you may feel, you are most certainly mistaken. you are complete and just as flawed as everyone else and worthy of love, however hard it may be to find that love.**"

anxiety,ptsd,1030,"my doctor and counselor have me listed as extreme anxiety and depression, early childhood ptsd, bi polar, borderline personality disorder. it's a relief to have an answer to what my problems are. this has been an on going problem my whole adult life. my first job, i had reasons for being depressed. i dropped out of school, parents were divorcing and i didn't have a stable housing situation, i was falling behind and depressed, full of anger and anxiety. i didn't want to call myself weak though and admit i had a problem, so i attempted to self medicate by escaping reality. i skateboarded, played video games, drank, smoked weed, partied, did everything i could to feel numb. 5 years later, because i didn't seek help or medication early on, i was put on suicide watch due to my new medications not worki application. my point to all this is i would be homeless and probably dead without her. she has saved my ass countless times over the years,having a mental illness makes holding a job so fucking difficult, i've lost at least 6 jobs since being with her. i have nothing but respect and love for her to be putting up with all this, while we are both still fairly young (i'm 24, she's 21 later this year) i wish her parents understood mental illness, but it's kind of a taboo in her family so we keep things as vague as possible. i just hope that i get through to disability services and can make an income that way, to relieve some stress from her life. she put off school for me from the very beginning, the least i can do is help her get through school. sorry about the rant. i hope everyone has a great day."

bipolar,anxiety,1054,"i have lied to my friends and family for a very long time. it goes beyond the ""how are you?"" and ""fine, thank you"" dialogue. i lived with a smile on my face and i told myself that i was strong. i recently had an episode where i couldn't fake it anymore. i became really really sick. and now, the people i love are asking me questions because theyd never hurt her like that. my mom looked so shocked. i want to keep lying and putting up a face. but the truth is that i'm exhausted and really tired of acting like someone i'm not. and i know that my family and friends are asking questions because they want to understand and help me, but i want them to continue seeing me as ""smiley joojoobar."""

ptsd,anxiety,1101,does anyone feel emotionally immature after/during an unmanageable anxiety attack or panic attack? i was diagnosed with ptsd when i was 7-8 years old (i'm 25 now &amp; still have it) and i was curious if anyone else feels emotionally immature as well. i recently had a bad anxiety attack with no known cause. during and afterwards i kept asking myself if i'm emotionally immature. i'm curious if anyone else experiences this or if it's just me. i keep meaning to talk to my therapist about it but i keep forgetting. i'm mature in other ways but emotionally i feel like it's that of a teenager.

anxiety,adhd,1119,"i might not be able to help everyone but hopefully one person. i'm in no way an expert and i'm still trying to master the following method. it's all about mindfulness/awareness/living in the moment, that's the answer. why do we get anxious at times? because of our thoughts - thoughts that only exists in our mind. it's almost impossible to be anxious while you're living inghts come and go. this is seriously as easy as it sounds, try it. for a few hours just let thoughts come and go and just be ""aware"" of that precise moment. before when i used to practice this i always gave up because i thought i was supposed to not think of anything but the key is to just be aware that you're thinking, control the thoughts, don't allow them to control you."

bipolar,depression,1155,"i am in grad school. i have two assignments to do before the end of the month and i'm not gonna do them. one was due dec 15, last year! accessibility services helped me get an extension to april 30. i haven't done any work on it. the anxiety is so high about it i'm not going to get it done. and i can't work on the other one, because then i'm not working on that one. i've sought help from accessibility services at school. i met with a learni the water. how many times do i get to ask for help? its not fair. i'm taking resources from the people who ask for help and then actually make use of it. the cycle is just going to continue. depression, procrastinate, anxiety, depression, ask for extension, depression, procrastinate, anxiety, depression. i hate it. it doesn't stop. my thoughts keep arriving at the only way to make it all stop entirely. but i don't want that. i don't think."
bipolar,depression,1159,because any kind of sickness is more tolerable than depression when it gets bad. i feel guilty for being around others when i might be contagious but it's what i have to do.
bipolar,depression,1164,"so i have known for a long time i have suffered from depression and anxiety. i mean if you check my posts history you can see that. i find myself frequently depressed, to the point of wanting to just end things (however won't for a myriad of reasons). i also find myself anxious beyond belief about certain things. i was told for years that i had both depression and anxiety. nothing more, nothing less. i have had manic episodes, and when i am on go, i am on go, but i am good at looking stoic and being ""normal"" on the outside. if that makes sense? howevee down and given me exams or anything but has suggested it for years. my therapist even was on the boarder about it for a while. i am sure my mom has it too, albeit far more showing? so yeah, here we are! rather here i am in my early 30s and finally things click. however, it is scary. like i don't know what comes next? will this diagnosis impact my life negatively and adversely? will i have to disclose it, or hide it from my job? i don't know. it is ironically depressing in of it self. but we shall see what the future holds. anyway, thanks for reading!"
anxiety,depression,1166,"since i was 12ish years old i've had anxiety, and it makes me nauseous and in pain sometimes and sweaty and shaky other times. when i am at my most bad feeling, sometimes i would feel suicidal. aaaaand, for the uplift; when i was 13 i didn't think i'd make it to 20 years old before dying and a couple weeks ago i turned 21!! my life is far from together and i still struggle but i haven't died! and that's something! i hope this isn't too morbid for you guys, it really means something to me that my child self was wrong about this and i felt like sharing."
bipolar,adhd,1167,"my doctor recently decided that she thought i was stable enough to start treating my adhd on top of my bp1. she warned me that the medicine could cause me to have a bad reaction and potentially lead to another psychotic episode or something. she started me on a low dose of vyvance but i didn't feel like it was doing anything and i've gradually gone up to the maximum dose. i've been pretty messed up for about a week now though. i also have pretty bad social anxiety and i think the meds are making me manic or mixed manic. i've been very disconnected from other people., paranoid and socially withdrawn. i havnt left my appartment sense saturday. im havingid because i don't want to get admitted again. she's a new doctor and i don't know how she is about this sort of thing. my last dr seemed like he wanted to try and have me admitted ""for observation"" all the time, even when he wanted to try me on new medicine. that's bullshit though because hospitals are safe places where they remove the stress of the outside world. how can they observe if a medicine is working or not if there aren't any factors at play that would cause an episode. i don't know what to do. i won't go in for an unscheduled appointment. the last time i went to an unscheduled appointment for issues i ended up being admitted against my will"
bipolar,anxiety,1177,"just wanted to share that i finally got myself together enough to book an appointment with the therapist. i kinda stopped going and kept putting it off (it's ok i'll go next month, etc.) three years later i find myself on the edge, i'm relieved to have made the call. wish me luck!"

bipolar,adhd,1195,"i was curious what people thought if it so far. the little activities have been interesting, but the questions they ask about if you did this or that on these medications has been somewhat useless to me. i've been on multiple medications for the majority of my adult life, so i don't always remember what caused what. i always assumed the brain fog was related to medication, and i was really kind of sad to find that the disorder causes it."

anxiety,adhd,1202,"**eating clean** this has had a huge impact on me. eat eggs, salad, chicken, salmon, brown rice. stop eating crap every day. you can still eat bad food, just eat less of it. make bad food the exception, not the rule. **exercising** try to get some kind of exercise in at least once a day, it's incredibly helpful for your brain. i lost close to 100lbs and now i'm in great shape. remember, you don't burn fat, you exhale it. find an exercise that will elevate your heart rate and get you exhaling more. **resting** don't forget to get your rest, try to sleep 8 hours a day. i've found this is also incredibly important for my brain. **becoming more goal oriented** having something to work towards can often take your mind off the things that are worrying you. **less social media** spend less time on social media in general. go outside and enjoy the world! these may seem stupid and simple, but they have worked for me and i wanted to share."

(i have medicaid) to get sleeping pills that actually work because she wouldn't return my call after giving my trazedone, which doesn't even work. i'm so angry at everyone. even my therapist who i told my problem to, i don't think he takes me seriously. i'm so tired."

anxiety,adhd,1224,"after months of being stuck in a loop of staying indoors and not stepping outside my comfort zone, i decided that i needed to challenge myself and do something that i haven’t done before. usually i go to the gym with my boyfriend, but even then, it has to be on a day when it is quiet, otherwise i feel overwhelmed. i had gotttare at me- but so what? no one really cares about what others do in the gym. with this in mind, i managed a great workout session and i plan to keep it up. i feel amazing! taking small steps and even having the intention of doing something new is a good step to take. i hope you guys work towards doing something new today. ☺️"
ptsd,depression,1226,"this week, i learned how my ex-wife treated my therapy. she would accuse me of ""getting worse"", so she would takes my kids to her parents for a few days and tell me she was staying with them. she made me believe i was getting worse, but i trusted her, since she was the one who helped me in the first place. i found out from her parents that she never stayed mfortable in my progress. my children are thankful that i'm no longer putting up with her lies, because they're old enough to see her manipulation. my 7 and 10 year old hugged me last night and told me that i'm a great dad. mom's out on a drinking binge right now, and i couldn't be happier, because now she can't use my kids or my recovery against me anymore."

anxiety,ptsd,1232,"seriously. a minute ago, i was shoveling food into my mouth. i felt like i had a billion things to do at the moment, even though in reality i had a lot of time to do those things. i felt light headed and my heart was racing. in the moment i realized that there was no point in rushing and decided to take my time eating. as soon as i started to slow down, my anxiety instantly improved. i didn't feel 100%, but i felt more calm and less overwhelmed than before. it's weird how a simple thing like eating slowly can change things up. (forgive me if this is an obvious lpt. it's certainly not new because i've been told it countless times, but i've often overlooked it. hopefully this will help those of you who overlooked it as i have.)"
ptsd,depression,1236,"i have this regularly and destroyed my social life once again a while back. i pushed away all people i love and lost basically every human connection. i feel like i'd just justify my behavior when explaining it to them and manipulate others into giving me another chance when i'll most likely do the same thing all over again in a few month/years. when i'm in such a state, i can't control it. i lose every human feeling and any empathy left in me. i don't think it's ever going to be any other way, so i don't care anymore. i'm starting to think that i should stay in this totally emotionless state just to stop hurting my loved ones."

bipolar,depression,1372,"i ordered a baby turtle! the backstory is that i had a turtle i found lost and wandering away from the water when i was about 8 and took him home and made a pet of him. he loved attention and ate from your hand, popped his head up every time he saw me. i loved him and was so attached. he died this fall, i'd had him for 24 years. i was devastated. i couldn't imagine not having him around. i found a website you can order turtles from and finally made the jump to order a baby turtle that looks just like him. i can't wait for him to come, i can see this really cheering me up."
adhd,none,1387,"i think - hard to count exactly - that last year i wrote seven published papers, a letter in a journal, a book chapter, two national guidelines and some policies. one or two might get peer rejected. whatevs. mike drop."
anxiety,adhd,1389,"i’ve been working for about 7 months, this is the longest i have held down a job. i’ve gotten a car and started driving for the first time and going places by myself, i’ve made friends and have learned how to talk to people better, i’ve opened my first credit card and started keeping track of bills. i’m still somewhat anxious but have learned to control it better, i’m currently struggling a little bit as a new driver but i’m sure i’ll get the hang of it. i just thought i’d share for anyone who is still struggling. 7 months ago i was completely lost and now i know what’s best for me."
depression,bipolar,1391,i've been in a major depressive episode for the last two years or so and lately i find myself only brushing my teeth maybe once a day and showering only once a week. i was just wondering if anyone else struggles with this at different times during a depressive episode.
bipolar,depression,1395,"just feeling lonely lately, and haven't had any friends with this shared experience. i'm in my early twenties but am totally cool with friends from all walks of life. let's get dinner or drinks!"
ptsd,depression,1399,i can't function. i have a test in the morning and a final exam thursday that i won't be attending. she ran away and got hit by a car and died. i don't know how i'm going to go on. i can't live without her.
bipolar,ptsd,1401,"i not insured and haven’t had any treatment in a few years. i’ve mostly been hanging on with a consistent sleep schedule, exercise, eating balanced, you know, being hyper vigilant about every aspect of my life. i moved a year ago, and i know no one here. i have no support system. and i feel not in control. my thoughts run away from me. i feel like i’m going psychotic, and i don’t know how to stop it, or where to turn for help. i wish i could get committed, but i don’t have the money, and i’m have college classes i already paid for starting at the end of august. i’m just not in a good place, and i don’t have any help. part of me knows that it’s just an episode and it’ll pass eventually but i don’t know how to ride it out. and i’m afraid if i continue with no treatment it’s going to become worse."
bipolar,ptsd,1403,i had the worst one of my life tonight. i was psychotic and had a flashback to my attempt. multiple times. my hand was talking to me and telling me bad things. i have 3-4 nightmares a week and they aren't getting better. i don't know why this is happening.
anxiety,depression,1404,"i feel alone and useless unless i'm high or drunk. i might be failing classes at this point, or at least close to, but i can't go to class unless i'm on something without feeling like i want to kill myself or just give up completely. i'm even high right now, i haven't been sober in over a week."
adhd,bipolar,1406,today i almost feel like... manic? i don't want to minimize what it's like to have an actual manic episode but goodness gracious my mind is racing. and i cannot focus on anything and feel like need to do something crazy. (more than i usually do hahaha)
bipolar,depression,1413,"i've been depressed for two months now, and panic attacks and prolonged crying jags from this week that have left me very depleted. this time around i'm feeling just so isolated. all of my close friends are in relationships, so they don't have much time to give me extra support. i understand that i can't be a priority for my friends and family all of the time, but a text checking that i'm ok every once in a while would go a long wacticing piano and reading, and today i even cooked for myself; but i'm just so tired. life is gray right now and it's hard, and trying to bring myself out of this depression feels almost impossible. i know it'll pass...i'm just not sure when, and waiting for it to lift is painful. i want my life back, dammit. sorry for the length and self-pitying nature of this post; i just needed to get this off my chest. thanks for reading &lt;3"
anxiety,depression,1420,"i think about death all the time. everything i do at this point i ask myself why? it won't matter when i'm dead. i keep thinking how i could die tonight, to tomorrow or in my 20's or in my 40's or just go into cardiac arrest before i finish posting this. what if i'm dead before this year ends? what if i'm dead before i meet a girl, or have kids, or hell what if i die before the next time i get to eat a steak or smoke a cigar. does anyone else have this? if so how do you cope? thanks. and sorry if i rambled."
bipolar,depression,1429,"i can’t sleep because my thoughts are racing, but i’m highly depressed and want to crawl into a hole. i had a few real low days last week and took off work - couldn’t sleep enough! the past 48 hours, though, i feel like i can’t sleep even a solid 20 minutes straight. yet i want to puke and curl up into a ball and just pick my skin excessively. just venting...."
adhd,none,1430,"i often have people bring up songs/albums/bands or movies/tv shows during conversation. they might say, ""have you seen or heard x?"" and if i have i will say ""yeah, i liked it, enjoyed it etc etc etc"". however, as soon as they go into more details such as band members or actor names, favourite lines from movies or lyrics from songs i can't actually remember any information beyond a couple of bits even though i know i've seen/heard it and i liked it. i fear it makes me appear as a compulsive liar who says they like things just to fit in when in reality i just cannot remember many details, lines, names or lyrics, just i enjoyed said movie/show/album etc. anyone else get this? feelsbadman.jpeg."
depression,anxiety,1434,"everyday in high school i see people who can be engaged in certain classes and discussions out of what seems like interest. sometimes i see or hear about a student who went above and beyond on something. or, at the very least, i notice people who can do work and study for tests reasonably ahead of time. every time i see one of these things i feel jealous, sad, and sometimes almosly interested in any of them. college is coming next year, and i have no idea what i'm going to do, or if i even have the motivation to make it through. it's been difficult enough pretending like i care in high school. any kind of work is just a massive mental chore to get through. if it weren't for my massive anxiety and fear of falling out, i probably wouldn't get anything done."
adhd,bipolar,1436,"it's so easy. step one: be unemployed, incredibly poor and three months behind on your rent. step two: desperately need to submit job applications, apply for temp work and sell things. step three: just do all that other stuff instead!!!!!! hope this helps guys! 👌💯😘"
depression,bipolar,1442,"i feel like i almost get some weird sense of satisfaction when i'm in a cycle of self loathing. i don't feel happy during it, but there's something addicting about having that nasty inner critic voice just shit on me and my self worth. it may be a type of cathartic release i'm feeling. whenever i try to reason with these thoughts and assert my worth, i feel uncomfortable. maybe it's because i feel undeserving and that i'm lying to myself to feel better. it's easier to mope and let the spiral of negative thoughts continue, and any resistance to it feels straining and requires a lot of mental effort. tl;dr anyone else feel a sense of catharsis when you have a spiral of negative thoughts of yourself? any tips for getting out of that cycle of thoughts?"
depression,adhd,1443,"i tried to post this a few times, but for reason it won't show up in the ""news feed"" and i thought it may be because the more i wrote the more i just started to vent. i am sorry if this isn't the right sub to post this and will gladly delete it if that is the case. and apologize for losing myself in writing all that down. it actually kinda helped me just to write it down and get it off my shoulders!"
none,bipolar,1444,"for my job, i can take 4 weeks off at once, starting january 1st. i'm very strongly considering antartica, as my only bucket list item is to go to all 7 continents. i've been to 4 and lived in 3... checking off antartica would be a dream! what can you recommend i do? when do think is best to go? i'd most likely go alone. money is a slight consideration... but i'd go into a little credit card debt for this :]"
adhd,anxiety,1456,"video games, weed, watching porn, eating fatty foods, drinking, etc. these are all things i find very hard to control. when i smoke a bit of weed i crave more instantly and i don't stop smoking until i'm baked out of my mind. whenever i'm feeling bad i start overeating, which leads to me feeling worse, which leads to more overeating. whenever i feel bored (which is quite often) i play video games. this leads to me using only video games for pleasure and to esccult emotions, and i dull myself with unhealthy behaviours, instead of just accepting the emotions and processing them in a healthy way. when i stop using these behaviours the negative thoughts and emotions start hitting me very hard. but probably that's just a phase you have to go through, to get out better on the otherside. are there others who struggle with balancing life like me? if you've found a solution, please elaborate. is this just a discipline thing?"
anxiety,adhd,1458,"hi guys, so yesterday i (23f) had my graduation and i asked my family to be there. i wanted to share this moment, but nothing big. i wanted to go to lunch with them, but they wanted dinner. i tried to push back but a while later i said 'ok. dinner'. it was aweful and i new it was gonna be. ( long story short: i sat there listening to conversations about my parent's business and ate my food) it wasnt my day. but my sister (43) told me ( as everybody else tells me) 'dont whine. they mean well and suck it up' *tl;dr: is it sellfish?! is it really?*"
ptsd,anxiety,1473,"i was 21 at the time, now i'm 22. in may of 2017, i got really sick out of no where. in a matter of 3 days, i went from feeling slightly out of it, to intense thunderclap headaches, pale, body aches, delirium, and ultimately passing out. i didn't want to make a scene or go to the hospital because i was just starting a new full time job, but i had a feeling that i was going to die. i can't really explain that very well, but i just knew deep down that someone was very wrong. at 4am i took an uber to the hospital and when i got there, upon checking my vitals (very low blood pressure and 160 resting heart rate) the nurses helped me onto a wheelchair and wheeled me into a bed in the intensive care unit. at this point, my memory is very groggy but i remember multiple people helping me take my clothes off to change me into a gown, and then doing an ecg on me. they got an iv into me and gave me a valium injection, as well as nausea medicine. i thought that was odd because i didn't feel nauseous at the time. the doctor came in and asked me what was wrong. i just cried and said my head hurt so bad, adn't push me too hard my fist few weeks back (i have a very physical job). now i'm healthier, but i still have a constant fear of getting sick again. i try to explain this to my mom and friends, but they think i'm just being dramatic and a hypochondriac. i don't feel safe anywhere but the hospital. i'm constantly scared. i don't have a fear of death, but knowing that i could easily become diseased and suffer, and leave all that i love behind makes me sad. it makes me sad that people don't understand what i went through. they are not educated on sepsis and think well ""hey, she didn't have cancer"" (my coworker actually said that, and later attributed my sepsis to being a vegetarian). i really don't talk about it a lot, but when i do, i get eye rolls. it's like people think i enjoyed taking a month off work. i constantly suffer from panic attacks now, where i feel dizzy and can't breathe well, but there's not much i can do about that. ativan doesn't help. my body and mind have been through hell and no one understands, or gives a shit. thank you for reading, i just had to get this off my chest."
anxiety,depression,1476,"i feel scared about if what i said was the right thing or if my opinions are reasonable. i know it’s stupid to want validation from a bunch of strangers or to base my thoughts on what others think of me, but it’s just a really bad habit that seems impossible to fix. it only becomes more obsessive as time goes on. my heart is jumping as i’m typing this post :(("
depression,anxiety,1482,"like the real laugh, from the heart... and its usually about something stupid but it feel so good and you stop and think of how long its been since that happened, and how you cant imagine that people are laughing and feeling like this all the time? when i get where i'm going i'm going to laugh and smile like that every day, and its going to be amazing."
ptsd,anxiety,1485,"my new therapist has been really great. today in our third session she asked if i would be more comfortable talking if she wasn't looking at me. i'm never comfortable with eye contact so i always look away, but no one has ever noticed before that i don't like being looked at. she turned away and i looked at the wall for the whole session and it really helped! i am so glad for this. it made such a huge difference for me and i feel a lot better about our sessions in general. i feel kind of stupid but holy shit! a small thing makes a huge difference!"
adhd,depression,1486,"i'm genuinely ecstatic! i never thought that i'd manage to come this far after my bout with depression last year but here we are! depression-free, and just full of boundless, controlled energy. but getting this job truly is by far, one of my greatest accomplishments to date. i never, *ever* thought i'd be at all considered for a job when put up against even ten people, let alone five thousand. the feeling of pride i have in myself is something i don't think i've felt before. to some extent i've always had a great deal of apathy when it came to personal fulfilment. that's why i want to thank you guys for your support, you're the reason i chose to get medicated. i hope now, i can help others achieve their goals too, as part of the collective community! tl;dr: got a job at a prestigious company at age 18. never thought i'd make it."
