ptsd,adhd,2,"i hate it when people treat it like i’m having a tantrum it’s so invalidating and patronizing. i’m a goddamn adult i have a job and pay taxes, if i don’t want to hear you say his name or talk about him so casually when you don’t think i’m listening then buck the fuck up and learn a little respect."
bipolar,adhd,13,"i'm so sick of being alone. i live with my family. we have different schedules so we don't see each other a lot. when we do, we get along okay, but they just don't understand me. it sounds super cliche but... we don't have a lot of the same things in common. they don't want to talk about the stuff i like to talk about, and on the off chance i do end up having a conversation about said things, i'm left feeling... ashamed? that's not the right word.ds me and the things i go through. and it's hard to find those kinds of people. i feel like the people around me are not on the same intellectual level as i am. not to say that they're stupid, because they're not, but our interests are just not the same. i need mental stimulation. i need adult conversation. i'm just here to vent, but is there anyone here who understands what i'm trying to say? i'm in my mid 20's, but i feel like an angsty teenager."
bipolar,depression,14,"what are you good at? i was just thinking today as i work on a painting and deal with soul sucking depression that i am extremely talented. i’ve gotten full ride scholarships for art school, i have won state awards, i don’t think i’ve ever not gotten into a juried show, i rule. i know how easy it is to get caught up in your negative qualities (especially with mental illness) but what are your strengths?"
anxiety,depression,21,"i hate myself i thought i was having a great time being myself and having fun but now, afterwards, i regret everything i did and said. i hate myself for how i acted and what i must have looked like. i want comfort and reassurance, but i am alone. this post is my comfort. knowing you are here with me as you read this. knowing you know what it is like to doubt yourself. wanting to go back and just try one more time and you'll do better. you won't be so you, so embarrassing and obvious. you won't be so eager for attention and overbearing. you won't feel like every part of you is just screaming for a sign of love but even if you saw it, you wouldn't understand it. thanks for being here with me, for having a broken heart with me, and wishing for just a little bit more with me."
depression,anxiety,30,"does anybody feel like they were born too weak and sensitive for this world? this world favors strong character: confidence, self-respect, charisma, determination, fearlessness etc etc. obviously i don't add up to any of those. in fact i'm downright opposite. my life so far has been a history of failures and regrets. i'm so sensitive it's honestly embarassing. at this point anything is enough to send me into an episode. i'm too fucking useless and repulsive to succeed anywhere in life. i find myself constantly daydreaming about an imaginary world, where i actually have friends, where i don't loathe myself so much, where life doesn't seem pointless and i have a purpose"
bipolar,depression,37,"all i want to do is sleep i'm so bored with my life. everything i do does not give me any satisfaction whatsoever ex: trying to be social, reading, watching movies etc. i just can't pay attention nor do i really want to. all i ever want to do is sleep because i'm soo classes because i really do not care to go to class because i can't even pay attention there so i feel like its a waste of time. does anyone ever feel this way? i know what depression is like but being absolutely emotionless is new... i don't really know what to do"
adhd,bipolar,53,"so this is probably why we end up super awake at night and hate mornings we all hate waking up and end up getting super alert at night, right? turns out that norephinephrine (one of the major things we are short on because it needs dopamine to make) is probably part of that. it is the thing that helps us become alert, increases steadily through the day,d make us sleep when it should, *and* norephinephrine helps regulate blood sugar levels, so we're more likely to be hypoglycemic zombies when we wake up in the morning, so we're screwed from multiple directions. ~~yes i have been geeking out researching neurotransmitters, why do you ask? don't worry, i'll have found a new fixation in a few more days :d~~"
bipolar,ptsd,57,"be kind to yourself i know i still deal with a lot of guilt because of my own journey of recovery: the starts and stops, random days when you’re not coping the best, feeling like i should be over this now and feeling like a burden to your family, despite the reassurance they gave you that you aren’t. your path of recovery doesn’t have to look the same as anyone else’s. we all have different perspectives, experiences, and places we start from. if you’re road is bumpy, off the beaten path, that’s ok. if anything, remember to be kind to yourself this weekend."
anxiety,none,71,"do not panic. 5 reasons the north korea situation will not put you or your friends in danger 1. despite the buffoon serving as the american president, there are other elected officials and higher ups whose voices matter too. despite the words coming out of his mouth, he doesn't have a giant dashboard of buttons he can shoot missiles out of. stop watk to the past. north korea has previously threatened both guam and hawaii, and is no stranger to threats. worse situations have happened in the past. just to list a few: the cuban missile crisis, the cold war, etc. and yet we are all still here. while the situation isn't a good thing, you and your friends will be fine. carry on with your daily lives."
depression,adhd,73,"i feel like a sim does anyone else ever feel like... they aren’t doing things for enjoyment but they’re just doing manual controls of themselves bc they have to? “ okay now it’s time to eat. okay that’s done, now it’s time to lay down. okay that’s done, now it’s time to see your friends” but everything really just feels like you’re going through the motions without any real enjoyment?"
depression,anxiety,77,"am i alone in thinking that there are a lot of creepy, unethical, and just plain weird therapists out there? this field needs higher barriers of entry and more active policing among its members. people always say ""see a therapist!"" but man, there are to it that says ""warning: therapists are often dangerously unethical and creepy. be careful."" of course what ""see a therapist!"" really means is ""stop bothering me with your problems, i'm trying to watch netflix in my pajamas."" such is life, eh? /rant"
ptsd,adhd,78,"after a bit of scrolling... i’m crying because reading some of these posts really make me feel validated and like i’m not alone. this week has been god awful, but finding this sub and being able to relate / not feel so alone is really helpful and i’m really happy that this community exists."
ptsd,bipolar,88,no one will give me my meds i've seen three different doctors and none of them will give me my meds. i'm literally getting to the point i will just buy the pills off the internet and risk going to prison just to function. they keep trying to tell me there are other meds that help that aren't addictive. why do they keep telling me this fucking lie and why the fuck do they believe it!!! i guess i'll just drink to function because that's what these people fucking want. i want to strangle these fucking doctors.
anxiety,adhd,94,"guys... i just did two things i never thought i'd do in a hundred years. i signed up for stuff. in 9 days i will be going to madison to see my favorite musician play live after being a big fan since i was like 13 (i'm 21 now). i'm going for a day and a night, hotel room and everything. also, i signed up to learn how to brew beer at the local museum, a two day class. day one is on tuesday and day two is at the end of the month. i've never just said ""eh, i want to do it, doesn't matter if i don't have anyone to do it with"" and just signed up for anything like this. i always stop if i can't find anyone to do it with me. but i figure if i live life like that, i'll never get to do anything i want to do ever. i'm excited, i'm nervous... but it's almost like a *good* nervousness."
anxiety,adhd,95,"i dislike it when someone asks me to take off my sunglasses for their convenience (in informal settings when there is sun obviously.) it has happened a few times when i was out with friends on sunny days, sitting in the shade outside of a restaurant or cafe.come awkward and cannot keep a conversation going smoothly. wearing sunglasses prevents this somehow. also in turn: i find it very rude of people to just demand someone to take off their sunglasses for your convenience. feels belittleling somehow. thoughts???"
anxiety,adhd,97,"i have this paranoia that everyone finds me weird, creepy, and text each other about me behind my back. i've been battling depression, anxiety for about 15 years. i've also struggled with adhd all my life. on top of that i'm in my mid 30s and never been in a relationship so my self esteem is cripplingly low. lately at work my anxiety has been getting worse. i'm convinced th think she isn't equipped to deal with my issues. i think i may need to move to a psychiatrist and take a more clinical approach. i'm supposed to see a doctor next week to see if she'll put me on depression and anxiety medication, but i really don't know what to expect. i'm so tired of my mind going nonstop all day. i just want to stop obsessing over what people think of me."
depression,ptsd,101,"i got raped twice and get bullied about it. i started to cry myself into sleep again for a week now and i don't know what to do anymore [context in the comments] i tried to post this a few times, but for reason it won't show up in the ""news feed"" and i thought it may be because the more i wrote the more i just started to vent. i am sorry if this isn't the right sub to post this and will gladly delete it if that is the case. and apologize for losing myself in writing all that down. it actually kinda helped me just to write it down and get it off my shoulders!"
bipolar,adhd,106,"i cleaned my kitchen counters off! my kitchen counters are always full of crap. half unpacked bags of groceries, 12 packs, bread products, clean dishes i didn't finish putting away, receipts, cookies, chips, you get the picture. well today i got the motivation to clean it off. now, i didn't clean clean the kitchen. my stove still has food stuck to it, floors need to be swept, sink is dirty, but i put all clean dishes away and sorted most of r in my room after i do some more grading. i did some grading today. is it the higher remeron dose kicking in? is it the tms working? is it the fact that i started taking a multivitamin, vitamin d, and b12? do i really care what it is? here it is, the middle of the night, i took the max dose of atarax/vistaril, and i'm still awake. shit. i would clean but i'm dizzy from the sleep meds. this is reminding me of when i was diagnosed before meds."
adhd,ptsd,108,"i missed the exit on the interstate for work this morning and i didn't realize it until i had crossed the state line. i was already running late (of course) and i don't know what happened to me. i've done this before (missed exits, turns) but i usua why am i like this? why can't i just have a brain like a normal person? i'm sorry, i don't normally let this stuff get to me but for some reason i'm really taking this hard. anyway, thanks for letting me get that off my chest. you guys are the best."
depression,anxiety,112,who else is goes to a fast food restaurant just to find a reason to get out of the house for an hour it's 1:40pm and i am sitting alone in taco bell eating a shredded chicken burrito and nacho fries. dining room is totally empty. wendy's is normally where i go because the dining room is always more active and feels a bit more cozy vs the sterile decor and hard seats of taco bell but i am getting bored of eating the same thing so figured i'd have some tb instead. not even sure of the point to typing this other than than to share my boredom. outside of errands or making service calls to clients my fast food outings are usually the only time i go out of the house.
depression,adhd,116,"why can't people understand i'm not just being lazy, i just feel unable to move no i'm not staying in bed until 3pm because i think it's cool, funny or that i'm lazy. it's because i can't bring myself to get up. i'm not wasting my life away on purpose or by choice. this isn't how i want things to be."
bipolar,ptsd,124,"louisiana flood victim, and i'm episodic i don't even know where to begin. i can barely hold my phone in my hands but these thoughts have to get out. i'm seeing signs that my mental health is suffering. i don't even want to talk about the flood anymore. i dont want to talk about my house, the work on my house, the everything. i'm so damn tired. i have eaten maybe 4 times since this all started. i've been working sun up-sun down on my house, with no luck in finding a contractor to help. yesterday was my birthday. i spent it gutting my walls and packing the few things we have left. i'm ""taking the day off"" to celebrate today... and i don't even want to. i can't sleep or eat. all i can do is stare at the wall a but i'm so exhausted. i'm mostly just depressed. actually since this started i've been episodic. right now my brain is running 10x its normal pace and i'm shaking and thinking all of these crazy thoughts and at the same time i'm numb and dont want to move or talk or eat or anything. every single day since this started i've lied in bed at night thinking how much i dont want to wake up. then when i wake up in the morning i start crying immediately when it all comes rushing back that this is my reality; this is my piss poor excuse for a human existence. fuck. i'm all over the damn place right now. thanks for reading, if you have. i'm not asking for a thing. i just needed to vent this out. i guess wish me luck."
adhd,bipolar,132,"the irony of ""what drugs are you on?"" is that i only hear it when i'm off my meds. i just thought it was funny that drugs are doing the exact opposite of how these people are implying it in this situation. i tend to argue with a wall of text for something that barely matters for me, likely so i can get my talking fix and 'cause it's stimulating."
bipolar,adhd,139,"forgetting how to speak correctly, or at all. i'm just curious to see if this happens to anyone else; the title is pretty self explanatory. (tl;dr at bottom) i don't mean like i'm ""out of it"" or even just fatigued for the day and my brain loses its train of thought one too many times. i feel like that happens to everyone at least once in a while (including myself). i mean like it takes an insane amount of mental energy for me to say a sentence from start to finish correctly, usually takes me a few tries to do so. so to say to speak, or how to speak in general. anyone else have similar experiences? tl;dr: does anyone sometimes find their speech to be very impaired, like you feel as if you forgot how to speak at all? maybe due to an episode, personal issues, both, etc? edit: thank you so much everyone who replied to this post, sharing your experiences and such. one of my biggest insecurities is my speech (due to the issue mentioned in this post) and it's so comforting to have so much nice, supportive feedback and to know i'm not alone on this :)"
anxiety,depression,146,"i'm 18 and i feel awful unless i'm drunk or high i feel alone and useless unless i'm high or drunk. i might be failing classes at this point, or at least close to, but i can't go to class unless i'm on something without feeling like i want to kill myself or just give up completely. i'm even high right now, i haven't been sober in over a week."
adhd,none,153,"i finished and turned in my dissertation a full 24 hours before the deadline! also i started the bulk of writing it three weeks ago! 25 chemical reactions ran, 9000 words, 80 pages, about 100 graphs created to visualize data, and another 40 illustrations of the reaction pathway. yay"
anxiety,adhd,155,"does anyone have trouble sitting still and have to occupy yourself? i can't sit still when i get my eyebrows done, and when i'm in class i usually doodle to focus. i pay attention very well in school regardless of that, and drawing helps me focus."
adhd,ptsd,157,i bit the bullet finally decided to take the plunge. i'm in the office waiting to get tested and i couldn't be more nervous. thanks for all the support guys. today i take control of my life.
anxiety,ptsd,163,"no panic attack got bad news today but i didnt have a panic attack. ive learned a lot of new techniques in therapy. things might not be ideal in life, more like a nightmare but, i didnt freak out when i otherwise might have. hoping for a weekend of keeping my cool."
adhd,anxiety,172,"two words.. noise. sensitivity. fuck. i can't filter out certain noises and it makes my head feel likes it's gonna explode. it makes me really anxious. i feel like everything is on maximum volume at all times and i can't put it on mute. the walls in my house are thin, and i can hear every footstep and deep voices feel like they're vibrating and it makes me want to rip my hair out. noise sensitivty feels like an itch i can't scratch. if this happens to you guys, what do you do to help it? i'm quickly going mad!"
anxiety,ptsd,191,"morning anxiety is totally debilitating. looking for tips. my anxiety when i first wake up everyday is so strong i struggle to leave my bed. i wake up from a typically sound sleep and get thrown into a shitstorm nearly everyday. i used to have ptsd related nightmares; thankfully those have died down but it sometimes feels like all the anxiety just builds up overnight and needs to get released every morning. i feel plastered to my bed with a racing mind that i can't control. i've tried things like ""you know this will go away in an hour. just ride it out"". i've tried grounding techniques. i've tried different types of weed and different benzos. i'm thinking about doing a small meditation everyday to see how that makes me feel- are there good apps out there i could try?"
bipolar,ptsd,197,"that left behind feeling? i've been feeling needy and ignored lately, the thing is i'm not interacting with anyone really outside my so. it's too much to handle right now. and my so gives me cuddles and is being helpful. there is really no one to ignore me, you know? but i just feel bad for some reason. i can't figure it out. i'm even upset when people don't reply or upvote my posts and that is really weird because i don't usually notice votes. i ruminate over whether i said the wrong thing or upset someone. i don't alwayen when i've gone into crisis i managed. i dunno, i felt a little weird after a session a few weeks ago. kinda like emdr weird and the session was kinda an unconscious exploring one, not emdr but a different therapy. i keep going back to that. i am left with just vague feelings i don't understand and just feeling uneasy. this is really bugging me. i keep expecting it to resolve, but when i'm resting or taking a time out to recharge it's really on my mind. and i feel unusually sensitive of late,since that weird appointment."
adhd,none,200,"i highly recommend mark manson's new book ""the subtle art of not giving a f***,"" it's been my most valuable resource of the past week. i picked up this new book called the subtle art of not giving a f*** from one of my favorite writers, mark manson and i've found it incredibly useful for dealing with both myg what's most important for you and focusing your fucks on that. anyway, if the above quotes sparked your interest i highly recommend purchasing the book. there are many fantastic subtleties to the topic that i couldn't possibly put down into a short post and mark manson is a great. peace and have a good day."
ptsd,anxiety,204,"therapist offered to look away and it worked my new therapist has been really great. today in our third session she asked if i would be more comfortable talking if she wasn't looking at me. i'm never comfortable with eye contact so i always look away, but no one has ever noticed before that i don't like being looked at. she turned away and i looked at the wall for the whole session and it really helped! i am so glad for this. it made such a huge difference for me and i feel a lot better about our sessions in general. i feel kind of stupid but holy shit! a small thing makes a huge difference!"
bipolar,depression,212,being attracted to your therapist is weird it’s only because he’s a decent looking dude who’s fulfilling my current emotional needs by being supportive and understanding. since that’s his job haha. it’s like beer goggles but with depression.
bipolar,depression,217,"just let me enjoy the damn weather! i live in south texas. the weather here is always humid and hot as balls, however we are finally beginning to see some weather changes. it was pouring almost all day yesterday and this morning when i walked out of my apartment to leave for work, it was fresh! fresh and cloudy and so beautiful, but then i started to feel the depression creeping in. for fuck's sake *eyerolls so fucking hard*"
ptsd,anxiety,218,"something feels wrong. like it says, something feels wrong. i can taste in my mouth that something isn't right. it's as if i'm looking at everything through a different light, like my mind is seperate from my body. i feel all these signals going off in my head, that tell me to run and to leave. my brain is filled with all these screaming noises. not voices, not people telling me to do things, but it's as if every thought i have is being screamed throughout my head. i can feel in my chest that something is wrong, it's not anxiety, it's my heart pumping so loud. it feels like something very bad is about to happen."
adhd,depression,219,i just got a lovely surprise in my inbox from a caring redditor. thank you to this [wonderful who went waaaay out of their way to try and hurt my feelings but ended up turning a bad day into a good one because it reminded me that some people have it worse. there are people out there who only feel good when they make others feel bad and those are the people to feel truly sorry for. i'm so flattered that they saw me as a target :)
depression,bipolar,225,"my marriage evaporated in an instant i came home from work and my husband had moved out. we had been together for more than 15 years. no desire to discuss what went wrong, no chance of reconciliation, no warning... he was just gone. i’ve had mdd for 9 years following a traumatic brain injury. now i’m in the deepest depression i can imagine. i’ve been hospitalized. i’ve been thru 7 weeks of outpatient. i can barely also wonder how long until everything physically starts falling apart around me because i’m not functioning and i’m alone in this house. i try to keep it clean. i care for my pets. i try to talk to someone every day so i’m not completely isolated. i’m working part time again and slugging thru it. it’s torture. i just needed to share this with someone other than my journal. the struggle to just survive is so painful."
bipolar,ptsd,237,"social media? facebook seriously stresses me out. does anyone else struggle with social media? i have a hard time staying connected to friends and family because the things people post can be serious triggers for me. it doesn't matter if i'm upcycling or downcycling, something is bound to either agitate or depress me. sometimes i go on binges of unfollowing people. that doesn't help because then i don't have those connections and my feed fills up with promotede relationships. i have my immediate family, and a couple of close friends (that's funny. i haven't seen them in literally a year and a half) but everyone else is an acquaintance at best. i don't even talk to my mother unless i have to, and that's after we've mended our relationship (as much as possible at this point). i'm not asking for advice, i just want to know that i'm not alone in feeling like this. do others have the same experiences? can you share some?"
bipolar,ptsd,244,"i was doing well till... i had my goals lined up for this week in this sub. my sunday line up looked good. and yesterday for mid week checkin i was feeling good. i had one con though which was going to the bank with my mom and fixing up finances aka debt. i was proud that i held in crying in front of the awesomely nice bank consultant. had to bite my tongue a couple of times in the office. but i lost it in the car. heres what triggered me: the bank consulant was 25 with a good job thats steady. im turning 28 in a month to this day and my nances are under her name, i have no idea where my checks from work go. i just quietly assume they just go on paying my debt to my parents, i have no relationship, i have no interests or passion. im sorry im just spiralling down a rabbit hole on my break from my 10 hour shift at work. the worst part was yelling at my mom when shes just trying to be there. sometimes i just feel like a raging monster. how the hell am i to be with a so in the future? thank you for reading. if i didnt vent i may not have the energy for my last 3 hours of work."
adhd,anxiety,248,"why can't i do ""unhealthy"" stuff responsibly? video games, weed, watching porn, eating fatty foods, drinking, etc. these are all things i find very hard to control. when i smoke a bit of weed i crave more instantly and i don't stop smoking until i'm baked out of my mind. whenever i'm feeling bad i start overeating, which leads to me feeling worse, which leads to more overeating. whenever i feel bored (which is quite often) i play video games. this leads to me using only vial with difficult emotions, and i dull myself with unhealthy behaviours, instead of just accepting the emotions and processing them in a healthy way. when i stop using these behaviours the negative thoughts and emotions start hitting me very hard. but probably that's just a phase you have to go through, to get out better on the otherside. are there others who struggle with balancing life like me? if you've found a solution, please elaborate. is this just a discipline thing?"
bipolar,ptsd,251,do you guys get nightmares? i had the worst one of my life tonight. i was psychotic and had a flashback to my attempt. multiple times. my hand was talking to me and telling me bad things. i have 3-4 nightmares a week and they aren't getting better. i don't know why this is happening.
depression,anxiety,259,"i accidentally turned in my poem journal to my teacher. i had to turn in my notes for a class, and forgot that i had a bunch of private writing in there. my teacher saw it, showed it to my other teachers, and eventually the principal, who sent me to the school therapist... it was the most embarrassing thing i've ever had to endure. i was called up to the school therapist's office and she showed me some scans of the journal and asked me what was up. it was a series of self deprecating shit about how much of a cunt i am. she had me explain why i was feeling that way, etc. i was in that room for about 2 hours. sounds like an awful situation, right? it turned out to be one of the best daynd it all) what was bad about it? * it was uncomfortable * it was embarrassing. take the fact that this is the only positive post that i have put on this sub (not about me nearly taking my life, or hating it) and realize that there is actual help to be had. even when it's uncomfortable as fuck, as i have come to find out. i'm still not happy, or even content. but i'm more sensible with thinking about the shit that has been going on in my life forever, and am able to think of it with a more realistic perspective. if anyone has any more questions or any advise for people reading this, unsure if they want some guidance or not? please, by all means put something down below. thank you, all."
bipolar,depression,265,"i'm in a rough patch, and it really hurts. i've been depressed for two months now, and panic attacks and prolonged crying jags from this week that have left me very depleted. this time around i'm feeling just so isolated. all of my close friends are in relationships, so they don't have much time to give me extra support. i understand that i can't be a priority for my friends and family all of the time, but a text checking that i'm ok every onci've been practicing piano and reading, and today i even cooked for myself; but i'm just so tired. life is gray right now and it's hard, and trying to bring myself out of this depression feels almost impossible. i know it'll pass...i'm just not sure when, and waiting for it to lift is painful. i want my life back, dammit. sorry for the length and self-pitying nature of this post; i just needed to get this off my chest. thanks for reading &lt;3"
ptsd,anxiety,273,"i'm not afraid. i don't feel anything. the most i'm granted is the sick, gut churning nausea that nearly comes up but i force myself to swallow. i either feel sick, or nothing. i never truly sleep. and i wake up wishing i wouldn't. just needed to vent. thanks for listening."
anxiety,ptsd,281,"wife had panic attack in the theater and passed out. my wife passed out from a panic attack yesterday in the theatre while we were watching *a quiet place*. i was so scared and didn't know what to do. about an hour into the movie, there's a scene where someone steps on a nail. it wasn't even very gory, but i guess it triggered some bad memories for her. a few seconds after that scene, my wife's arm started twitching kind of like a seizure. at the same time, she started making sounds like she was snoring or maybe choking. when i looked at her, her head was lolled to the side and her eyes were closed. not realizing what was happening, i nudged her a bit, thinking she had fallen asleep. when her head rolled to the other side and there wasn't any other response my concern sky-rocketed. i took her head in my hands and gently shook her a little bit trying to wake her up. her eyes partially opened, and i could see her pupils were looking up like when you roll your eyes. there was no other response. i tilted her head forward and the ""snoring"" sound stopped, but she was still unconscious. at this point,d her and help her feel safe. i tried to just hold her and comfort her. after about a half hour she was doing better. i felt so helpless when she was unconscious. it's very scary when you suddenly realize your loved one is having a medical emergency. later in the evening, she revealed to me that when she was a teenager, she had an abusive boyfriend that would rape her, cut her with a scalpel, and poke her with needles. sick stuff like that i guess. she wouldn't say much more about it than that. i am angry. not at her, but at the thought some sicko did this to her. and i hurt. i grieve that she has experienced something so traumatic it causes this type of thing. she agreed we will get her into some therapy. she needs healing that i never knew she needed. i also know this isn't about me, but i feel a bit hurt this is just now coming out. we've been married about 5 years, and i never knew this stuff. what else don't i know? i don't know what type of advice i'm looking for. how can i be there for her? how can i help? what do i do if this happens again? did i do the right thing both during and after?"
bipolar,depression,282,"anyone in boston want to meet up? just feeling lonely lately, and haven't had any friends with this shared experience. i'm in my early twenties but am totally cool with friends from all walks of life. let's get dinner or drinks!"
anxiety,adhd,295,"i'm 25 and i'm tired. tired of knowing who i am, but not what i want to be. tired of society deciding where i should be at in life and what i should be doing. tired of feeling like all i've done is waste my time not knowing what to do. tired of being told to make a difference in the world. tireat. tired of looking at others achievements and feeling perpetually inferior. tired of feeling like i'm in some race that i'm losing. tired of self doubt. tired of this never-ending cycle. i'm exhausted and i don't know what to do about it. does anyone else feel this way? if so, what did you do?"
bipolar,anxiety,297,"cried for the 1st time in over 5 years title says it all. i was bombarded this morning by my boss, essentially belittling me in front of the entire office. i sucked up like the man i am, and sat down behind my desk. and then it hit me. a wave on extreme anxiety and panic. my chest pounded like mad, i began to sweat heavily, the lights hurt my eyes, and my legs began to bounce and shake. i tried holding it back, that pain in the throat that makes it hard to swallow. i almost forgot how that felt. i ran to the back half of the office, stood out in secluded section of the warehouse and wept. granted it was for only about 30 seconds, i haven't felt such relief in so long."
depression,bipolar,306,"just got my hospital bill from suicide attempt word to the wise, if you want to commit suicide don't call anyone for help. they send a fucking ambulance, force you into it by strapping you down, send you to a mental hospital for mandatory 72-90 hours (weekends don't count), drug you up until your delusional and then bill you for the whole damn thing so you're broke and suicidal again. next time i have a gun to my head i'm pulling the trigger, calling for ""help"" makes everything worse."

bipolar,anxiety,391,"""1) nothing makes you happy/all you do is complain/2) everytime we talk, there's conflict, so i'm anxious whenever we speak/ 3) every time you talk, you complain."" i'm afraid of being this unhappy person who pushes people away. anyone hear else? 3 long stories; tldr at the bottom. so in the title, within quotation marks, are what i've heard from people i spent the most time with. 1) my mom, 2) a now-ex boyfriend, and 3) a former friend. 1) my mom kinda blew up in the parking lot of a hospital. the doctor said i didn't need a cough pill for my infection, and would be fine with only the prescription she gave me, and then my mom asked if she could prescribe me with a cough syrup. the doctor agreed to prescribe a strong cough syrup, and i asked if i don't need a cough pill, ""do i need cough syrup?"" the doctor said no, but said ""the medicines won't react with one another,"" and ""if you want a cough syrup, i can prescribe one."" *but i don't.* my cough won't go away (respitory infection) until the steroids kick in, but it will go away. i don't like taking meds i don't need. i'm defensive about this, because every time i have respitory issues, my mom asks the doc for a cough syrup ""for my own good"" and i feel like shit bc it's got some depressive drug in it, and i feel ultra sluggish the morning after i take it. i don't need it so i'm adverse to taking it. my mom says it's ridiculous that i have a cough and won't take a cough syrup, when no cough syrup was prescribed or suggested. the steroids will take it's course. but mothers will be mothers. i just hate taking drugs i don't actually need. (and i'm 18 so i'd think the doctor would have asked me first. guess not.) anyway she called me ungrateful and wouldn't let me speak and i dunno. it hit me. she said: ""i'm better off dead than i am alive to you, because nothing i do as your mother makes you happy."" i wanted to shoot myself in the mouth right there and then, ngl. i know that isn't the (logical) answer to this, but she isn't the only one who's said stuff like this. 2) my ldr boyfriend of two years broke up with me last night. he says he doesn't feel like he can talk to me, because he says offhanded things, and for a while, i didn't address them until months later (which is toxic). and now he feels that he'll fuck up no matter what he does, so what's the point. in the past i've addressed things as they came up and he either made fun of me, got super defensive, or asked ""so what's the problem?"". for example: he didn't speak to me for long periods of time. for like. a year. cancelled majority of skype dates at the last second. i said that i knew he has other obligations, but that still felt a bit emotionally neglected. (being left on read for days and sometimes weeks, not hearing from him for months, reading an ""i love you, too"" from him was rare. i felt like he didn't like me.) but he said that i had no reason to believe that. he had a roommate who made me cry, and he didn't defend me. even if i say that i didn't appreciate a comment, he would just join him. of course, he didn't mean to be rude, and of course he didn't mean to overlook my crying, didn't mean to misunderstand me. but he refused to buy earbuds because of his ""indispoable income"" (even if he went out to drink once a month). which gave his roommate ammo to be a bully. so i mailed my then-bf earbuds and he lost them. it felt as if he didn't put any effort into the relationship, and was justifying himself. when i asked if he wanted to break up, he sounded surprised and confused as to why. said that he loves me. i wasn't angry, just hurt and confused with all the mixed messages. but i said i believed him and ignored my gut. plus, on holidays, he drives six hundred miles in one go to visit me (and his family. so contrary to what he says, i'm not the only reason he comes to the city i live in.) but he said ""you think i wanna see my family? barely anyone there wants to see me. i'md avoiding me, too. avoiding everyone. got in a real bad funk. said uncalled for comments to me and to other people. i understand how depression can be; but that doesn't excuse her from being mean. from playing rough and with scissors (as a seventeen year old). from going out of her way to patronize people. but she put on her snapchat story her suicidal thoughts, talking about how everyone she knows is against her. so i swiped up, let her know that i apologize if i wronged her, and that i want her to be okay. that i don't think anyone is against her. that i am here if she needs to talk. she said that i can't make her pity me, and i was baffled. that she doesn't have the energy for my bullshit. (yikes.) that i shouldn't play nice if i don't feel nicely about a person. (still don't know what's she was talking about but it was childish. but still yikes.) and then she said all i do is complain about my family problems and boyfriend and do nothing to fix it. (that was when i said ""good to know,"" and blocked her. hehe.) it's so funny that she *asked me* what's wrong, didn't accept ""nothing"" for an answer, and then secretly hated when i was open and honest. i thought she was my friend. but i guess only therapists are meant to hear your problems. anyway. i digress. days after i blocked her, she came around me in person. went out of her way to sit next to me. acted fearful, as if i would reject her. took every single chance she got to be overly nice. for example: i was presenting and the class (of 13 people) was talking over me. she stood up, cupped both hands over her mouth, and projected: ""everyone! chris is talking! it is important to hear what they say, so that they can finish their presentation!"" sat down, then grinned at me. the class had the same weirded-out expression as i did. like. ugh. that was so artificial that it hurt me. i have a floridan friend who i tell some of these situations with, and he says it sounds like the other person has some unsolved problems of their own. my therapist said the same thing about all three scenarios. that nothing i complain about is like. ""i'm so sad my dad got me a blue car. i wanted a red one."" y'know? like the problems that bother me are literally ""so i'm homeless and don't know where i'm sleeping tonight "" or ""i got 27 spider bites in my sleep"" or ""my mom is threatening to kick me out and i'm an unemployed student"" or something that can't be given advice, because it's totally out of anyone's control. like when my car got totalled and i kept having flashbacks about the crash throughout the day. i couldn't sleep at night. for weeks. or when three of my classmates died. or when i was in a sexually abusive relationship for six months, got assaulted everyday on school grounds, and didn't tell anyone for eight months. i have flashbacks and awful dreams about *that* one to this day. but i don't say anything until someone asks me what's wrong. and even if they do, i'm reluctant to say so. bc none of this can be hugged better. it's heavy. it's uncomfortable and nobody wants to hear it. those are the only things that get to me. those are the things i go to therapy for. but my therapist doesn't believe in dwelling on (talking about) past traumas and griefs. i don't know what anyone wants me to do anymore. do i just let go of *everything*? i do not exagerrate; these things happened in the same twelve months. i'm not trying to excuse my complaints, but, yikes. i don't know what to make of any of this. anyway. tldr: nobody i open up to stick around. are all of these situations like. situations where both parties have made acceptable mistakes in handling their situation? or am i this unhappy person who makes people miserable because i complain so much? am i ungrateful? am i being crazy for saying the things i do? does anyone else hear statements like these from people who see you the most? it's times like these that makes self destructive behavior so easy."
bipolar,ptsd,393,"yesterday my ex started harassing me and then a friend choked me yesterday was rough. i broke things off with my ex the day before yesterday due to some toxic and manipulative behavior. he freaked out on me and has been sending me messages on every app possible saying some of the most horrible things imaginable up until yesterday evening when i blocked him on everything possible. we we're dating for 6 years and i feel so fucking dumb. it was obvious helogized and then when i said i didn't want to hang again he tried to blame me for his actions so i blocked him too. i think i'm ok emotionally, but what the fuck? idk why i keep attracting people like this. i just don't understand and i'm so sick of it. i'm a sweet person and i don't feel like i deserve it. anyway, i just wanted to vent about my fucking horrible day yesterday. it was a scary day. as always, you guys are wonderful people and thank you :)"

adhd,ptsd,642,"tips on regulating emotions, specifically the ""cringe"" feeling? you know how sometimes you'll just remember something in the past you did and cringe at yourself and its like, kinda physically painful? that's the feeling i'm talking about. for most people it just kinda comes and goes and they are fine bearing it for a moment, however i seem to either be hypersensitive to the feeling or just really bad at regulating it (probably a bit of both tbh), as half the time ""i wanna punch myself"" doesn't stop at just being a descriptor of how and feel and ends up being a bit of how i cope with it til it passes :/ i'll end up hitting myself on my leg or arm or something or punching a nearby wall as a way to relieve the tension, never hard enough to leave a lasting mark but often enough to be worrisome. i know it's not healthy but i don't know wh perform in any way i'll end up having a panic attack, yet i pretty much never actively avoid possible triggers and even signed up for my school's improv and dance clubs completely out of my own freewill (actually participating, however, is a different matter). basically, never happens to me lol. does anyone have any advice on better ways to cope with the cringe feelings, or with just emotional regulation in general? i'm on ritalin ir rn and while it does seem to help a bit, the problem is still very present, especially later in the evening or at night where i'm more tired and the meds have worn off. **tl;dr i have general emotional regulation problems and specifically always end up coping with ""cringe"" feelings with self harm. does anyone have advice on healthier ways to cope or other general help with emotional regulation?** thanks!"

(this will be kinda rambly) i was diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety disorder after i checked into a psychiatric hospital a few years back, but i always felt as i grew up that something was wrong. when i went to go meet my biological mother (who is very bipolar) when i was 18 things started to click with me that i needed to figure out a way to find meaning. it didn't help that my step-mom was an abusive cunt. so overall i kinda suck at being a person.(still do) anyways, i've struggled with constantly feeling down, and also feeling a whole lotta shit i didn't really understand. because of this i turned to weed and alcohol when i was 15. went through a few phases of drinking hard, but really weed was my poison of choice(still dont think it's bad but that's for another sub). again anyways because of the plant i kinda regained a sense of what it meant to be a healthy funcnt know how we'll pay the rent, things get complicated with family, with work, with life. and all of it together makes me wanna opt out. but then i think of leaving him by himself to deal with it himself and what a living hell that would be. even if i cant do much, ill do what i can till i can't. because if i dont that would make me sadder than anything i can ever encounter in my life. my point is that out there there are strong, amazing, incredibly intelligent and driven people, who do this shit alone. while feeling everything. and its heart breaking. my dad spent his life trying to make me feel welcome when every fiber of my being says i don't belong on this earth. the least i can do is gtfo bed and try to do something. even if my battle that day is just to brush my teeth. so that he can see a good looking smile that he made. to make him feel just a little better. that's my part, my mission. thats what gets me up. there are people that can use your help, and you owe it to them. but that s just my opinion."

ptsd,anxiety,992,"my therapist has cancer just, come on, universe! really? this therapist saved my life, i owe everything to her, but now i have to watch her go through chemo and radiation completely helpless to do anything. she assures me it's not severe, that they caught it early, that she expects to make a full recovery. it still sucks balls to walk into the office and see that she's bald and sometimes has a hard time finding words because the chemo fucks with her brain. i'm not looking for sympathy or advice, just a rant because it feels like the one thing in the whole world that i can't discuss with her."

anxiety,ptsd,997,"i bury my best friend tomorrow. i bumped into my ex with another guy. i can't deal with this. i feel sick. tomorrow i bury my best friend who tragically passed away at the age of 25. i'm heartbroken and i will be speaking at his funeral. i am happy with the speech but i am nervous, petrified to mess up. he was an incredible guy and i want to send him off well, justify what he meant to me. my ex who broke up with me 2 months ago has kept contact to ask how i have been doing and if i ever needed anything go to her. i went to the gym yesterday evening just to pass the time and maybe work off a small hangover i was nursing from the night before. i felt okay but by the end of my session i was very tired. as i was walking back towards my flat i spot my ex with a guy next to her sitting down. i could have turned around but i didn't. i go up to her and say hi, she seems shocked to see me and asks if i'm doing okay. i say no, not really and say i'll leave them to it and say goodbye. as i walk down the road my ex has caught up with me aftst before the break up about a guy who has a family that makes her laugh, feel alive. this guy has a child. i recognise him from her xmas party. i'm really confused about why she chased after me. it's obvious she cares but is she feeling guilty, trying to spare my feelings in the hardest time of my life. i do want her back in my life but seeing her with another guy hurt big time. seeing them close to each other eating ice cream. she works with him, did she like him when we were dating. i also hate the idea of her sharing her sympathy and support with other people, especially a guy like that. and it hurts to hear her say to me he's going through a hard time. i'm going through the hardest time of my life. i feel like i can't use her as a crutch. i'm so confused, hurt, a mess. i bury my best friend tomorrow . i am absolutely terrified. i feel sick, like i'm going to mess up and ruin everything. the last 2 months has been the worst of my life, it just has. i want things to be better. i want him back. i want her back. i feel terrible."

ptsd,anxiety,1216,"someone finally noticed my flinching. success story! it’s been a long time, but i’ve never been able to school myself into calm when i see something moving out of the corner of my eye. walking across a baseball field, basketball court, or anything with moving projectiles puts me on edge and every sound is like something being thrown directly at me. after a year of dating, it finally happened. my boyfriend made a gesture like pointing at me, with something in his hand. i flinched. as usual, jerked my head and closed my eyes. he held tightly to me, and told me over and over again (with tears in his eyes) how he’d never throw anything at me. ever. it just shows, after the many years of my life, i finally have a shoulder to lean on. and yours may not be far away, so please don’t give up."
adhd,depression,1221,"what learned helplessness is like just in case anyone isn't aware of what learned helplessness feels like, and as a warning to people not to keep trying the same thing over and over, i've written the following. i will use the term ""brain"" to refer to the unconscious, impulsive parts of the brain, the parts that aren't ""you"", and ""you"" to refer to your conscious experience and rational brain. (disclaimer, this is only my experience, i don't know what other people's experiences are.) --- imagine walking around, going through life, except you don't decide what you do. your brain decides everything for you and you have no say. it wants to play video games, so you play video games. that isn't to say you don't fight it, but on those occasions that you do you either are simply unable to do anything, or every frustration with yourself for every past failure floods upon you, washing your willpower away in a tidal wave of anxiety. you quickly learn the only way to fight is to not fight at all. --- now, imagine somebody calmly tells you, ""i know it's hard, but you really need to just get up and do it. i have no magic bullet unfortunately."" this is nice, they know that you have a hard time ""just doing it"" but at this point there's no way around it, it just needs to be done. you wholeheartedly agree with them, and feel like the ultimate solution _is_ to ""just do it"". your brain however immediately reminds you how ""it's never worked before, so why will it work now?"" this isn't just a small voice, it is backed by the combined anxiety of every failure and inadequacy you have ever had. --- i'll attempt to explain what lies behind this sense of hopelessness: this sense of hopelessness, in its simplest form, is the feeling that ""it's never worked, so why would it change?"" however, it goes deeper than that. the following is the main thought process: - according to other people you just need to try hard enough to solve the problem - you feel ""i just don't care anymore"" ( ditto ) - ""i hate myself"" (when i metaphorically close my eyes, cover my ears, and run from what i need to do yelling ""lalalalalalalala"", also when i am sitting doing something i enjoy and remember what i'm supposed to be doing) - ""i just can't."" (when i try to calm myself or when i'm lying in a fetal position on the bed, spiraling deeper into depression) - ""i just want the world to go away"" (this feeling makes me realize why some people kill themselves. i fortunately just retreat to my bed or some form of entertainment that allows my brain to shut off temporarily) --- i'm not saying this is permanent problem, or that there aren't any solutions, just that it's incredibly difficult, more difficult than i feel most anyone can imagine. it's the torture of hopelessness, with the frustration of fully knowing with your rational brain that hope itself is all that is needed to solve the problem, yet finding that hope hopelessly far away. please, everyone. think before you tell someone to ""just try."" they may have forgotten how to. --- edit: some people may say that you just need to build in systems, and i agree that that is a good solution, but at least for me, i've tried so many of my own systems that even trying to talk with it causes my brain to lock up with anxiety. likely because it forces me to confront all my past failures, which further discourages me from trying. i'd still love to hear any advice people have though. --- tl;dr; learned helplessness isn't thinking you are helpless, it is feeling that you've forgotten how to try. if you really wanted to try it would have worked, since people say to just try, so you must not really _want_ to try, so you begin to instead want to want to try. in addition, confronting it in any way brings with it all the anxiety of every past failure, meaning that often, instead of doing something you often fail to do you just close your eyes and hope it'll go away."
ptsd,anxiety,1228,"i did everything right, and it didn't matter i went to a pool party this weekend for a friend's birthday i made playing dnd. one of the guys there picked me up in the water, i said ""i don't like touching,"" and he dunked me. he brought me back up, and i said ""stop! i don't like touching,"" and he dunked me again. a group of his friends was standing very close and could have stopped it, but i wasn't listened to with the respect i deserved. so, this guy got to grab me, put me in a panic attack, and have a great pary and specifically my mother failed to believe me and extract me from a nightmarish situation. just like i did everything right at the party and a group of my so-called nerd friends left me to deal with the situation on my own. i've also been struggling with feeling like i'm making a big deal out of a small flirtatious move. but it's the speaking my boundaries and wishes and having them ignored that feels so, so much like i'm 8 again. i'm 8, and i just have to acquiesce to a man's wishes and not consider my own."
