bipolar,ptsd,10,i had the worst one of my life tonight. i was psychotic and had a flashback to my attempt. multiple times. my hand was talking to me and telling me bad things. i have 3-4 nightmares a week and they aren't getting better. i don't know why this is happening.
depression,ptsd,14,"i enjoy hanging out in groups and watching people interact with each other, but i hate that i have to be apart of it. i'd much rather just be a fly on the wall through life than to have to be an active participant. kinda hard to put into words. anyone feel similar?"
adhd,anxiety,15,"so, you've spent a while working hard at school/life/career/relationships. things have been going well, and all of a sudden some much needed time off comes along. you've got half the week off, and the other half is pretty light in comparison, so it's the fucking best. you can slack off a little bit, and let your mind wander, and there's no ill effects, because everyone does iticult. you got this. slowly scale back your bed time and get a little more rest each night. try to set some reasonable alarms for yourself this weekend, so you keep up the pattern of waking up before noon, and try to make a short to do list to be able to check off some accomplishments. remember, forgive yourself, and don't let any stumbles make you feel like everything is lost."
anxiety,adhd,17,"so in my bigger lecture classes, i generally keep to myself and the classes are so big that it doesn't make much of a difference. smaller classes i would stress out a lot more about it but in bigger classes, i just have my misophonia to worry about. but yesterday, my class got moved and i was walking into the building to look for is and saw another girl heading in the same direction, so i asked if she was heading to the same place and she said yes, so i walked with her. we walked in silence for a little bit, then i finally worked up the courage to try and start a conversation with her by asking what her major is. and somehow, we got to talking for the full 20 minutes before class starts! i've never had such a lovely conversation with a stranger so easily, and we connected on a lot of things. i don't know if i'll ever see her again because the class is so big, but i was just happy to have someone to talk to and this has never happened before."
depression,bipolar,25,"i really let it get out of hand this time folks. i got an email today saying i‚Äôm being excluded from my academics (meaning won‚Äôt be able to go to class...) because i didn‚Äôt pass 2 of my classes. so now, my choices are 1. talk to the dean to see if i qualify for a cancellation of exclusion, 2. get suspended, or 3. drop out of school. this really pte limit. i‚Äôm not sure if i‚Äôll be able to take it. i can‚Äôt live with my parents again. my dad doesn‚Äôt believe in mental illness whatever that means. thinking about this situation makes me hate everything. im so done with life. i don‚Äôt know why i even try anymore. i knew i wasn‚Äôt cut out for college and i might as well give up and go waitress again"
anxiety,none,30,"1. despite the buffoon serving as the american president, there are other elected officials and higher ups whose voices matter too. despite the words coming out of his mouth, he doesn't have a giant dashboard of buttons he can shoot missiles out of. stop watching so many movies. 2. war is costly. nobody wants it, and all tas previously threatened both guam and hawaii, and is no stranger to threats. worse situations have happened in the past. just to list a few: the cuban missile crisis, the cold war, etc. and yet we are all still here. while the situation isn't a good thing, you and your friends will be fine. carry on with your daily lives."
depression,anxiety,35,"after having to take a medical leave from a good college because of my depression and social anxiety, what i did today made me extremely happy. i hope i keep doing better. edit: thank you for all the support! i think this goes to show that any step you take to better yourself, no matter how small, is significant. i love this community."
ptsd,anxiety,45,i'm sorry i can't think straight now and i'm panicking and shaking and i can't quit crying like a goddamn baby. i just looked up this sub now never been here before. my husband is always sneaking up on me and i guess it's an accident but i can't handle it. i had just screamed myself awake for the third time tonight/ this morning (and he knew it) when he entered a room right behind me while i had my back turned a split second and i turned and screamed moreking progress and the cops don't know where he is. i'm seriously thinking of putting bells on my husband or making a rule he has to call and get a response before entering a room. but dammit that sounds so disfunctional and i think he'd forget anyway but what do i do????? i've told him to sing or hum or talk to the cats as he moves through the house so i can hear him but most often he never does. what can i do? please help. edit: cause i didn't make sense
ptsd,anxiety,52,"like it says, something feels wrong. i can taste in my mouth that something isn't right. it's as if i'm looking at everything through a different light, like my mind is seperate from my body. i feel all these signals going off in my head, that tell me to run and to leave. my brain is filled with all these screaming noises. not voices, not people telling me to do things, but it's as if every thought i have is being screamed throughout my head. i can feel in my chest that something is wrong, it's not anxiety, it's my heart pumping so loud. it feels like something very bad is about to happen."
none,adhd,56,most people get relased after 14 years or earlier after commiting brutal crimes like murder . but here is a man who spent 54 years in prison without committing a crime and without facing a trial . the entire system is a joke. god knows how many such people are still in the prsion.
depression,bipolar,67,"i can feel whats left of my intelligence waning, my short term memory is non-existant and i even struggle to read and follow movies. is this typical of depression? can i recover my mental acuity?"
ptsd,anxiety,69,"outside of my husband and my mother in law, i have no one. i work from home so, no coworkers. i go grocery shopping and can do things outside the house if i need to so it‚Äôs not severe social anxiety or agoraphobia. i can have a conversation and i‚Äôm pleasant. i just honestly have no desire to have people in my life at all. i don‚Äôt want that. i don‚Äôt mind that i don‚Äôt have a single friend, aside from my husband and mother in law. i don‚Äôt mind that i probably don‚Äôt even exist to most people. in fact, it‚Äôs comforting to me to think that i don‚Äôt exist to anyone else. i don‚Äôt want anyone to think about me, or know me. i‚Äôve even told my husband that if i die before him, please don‚Äôt have a funeral for me because i don‚Äôt even want anyone to know i‚Äôve died, if at all possible. anyone else find themselves totally and completely okay with solitude?"
adhd,bipolar,70,"it's so easy. step one: be unemployed, incredibly poor and three months behind on your rent. step two: desperately need to submit job applications, apply for temp work and sell things. step three: just do all that other stuff instead!!!!!! hope this helps guys! üëåüíØüòò"
ptsd,bipolar,73,"the most i'm granted is the sick, gut churning nausea that nearly comes up but i force myself to swallow. i either feel sick, or nothing. i never truly sleep. and i wake up wishing i wouldn't. just needed to vent. thanks for listening."
depression,anxiety,74,"i have somebody in my life now. a few months ago i posted about having nobody to talk to. well, last week that changed. during school, (hs btw) i was sitting in class doing nothing. deadpan as ever, when this girl in front of me just turns around and start talking to me. i was caught off guard. i haven't had a loose, non structured, conversation with a stranger for a very long time,. a girl even moreso but i talked to her, let my guard down for a minute and really had a good time talking to this stranger. after the class, we parted ways. i was extremely happy. talking to somebody after all this time has really helped wifh my self worth issues. the fact that somebody just talked to me out of the good of their heart is very foreign to me. now, we talk periodically, and i feel human for the first time in a long time. wish me luck, guys."
none,anxiety,76,"basically i commented on something in a group chat and a girl replied ‚Äúmood‚Äù. now i know that means ‚Äúi feel the same‚Äù, i‚Äôm just wondering if i need to reply to that somehow? if i don‚Äôt say anything would it be awkward?"
anxiety,none,80,"i signed up for stuff. in 9 days i will be going to madison to see my favorite musician play live after being a big fan since i was like 13 (i'm 21 now). i'm going for a day and a night, hotel room and everything. also, i signed up to learn how to brew beer at the local museum, a two day class. day one is on tuesday and day two is at the end of the month. i've never just said ""eh, i want to do it, doesn't matter if i don't have anyone to do it with"" and just signed up for anything like this. i always stop if i can't find anyone to do it with me. but i figure if i live life like that, i'll never get to do anything i want to do ever. i'm excited, i'm nervous... but it's almost like a *good* nervousness."
ptsd,anxiety,83,"i would like to know if you might have some advice for this. i've never talked about what happened whit him but he knows that there is something wrorng because i often panick with him. he has a lot of respect for my silence but i really feel the need to talk. i've never done this and even if i want to do it, when he ask me if i want to explain him what happened i just say that i don't know what to say. how do you open up to someone? are there some things that make it easier?"
depression,adhd,90,"i tried to post this a few times, but for reason it won't show up in the ""news feed"" and i thought it may be because the more i wrote the more i just started to vent. i am sorry if this isn't the right sub to post this and will gladly delete it if that is the case. and apologize for losing myself in writing all that down. it actually kinda helped me just to write it down and get it off my shoulders!"
depression,adhd,91,"i don't really *want* anything, so i just try to fake it. i pretend i'm into whatever it is my friends are interested in. i pretend i like going to see movies with them. i just spent 3 days at a gaming convention where i pretended to enjoy myself. i feel like the only thing i genuinely want, is food and sleep. i wish i wanted things. even simple, stupid shit. i have a friend who is passionate about lego and can't wait to buy his next lego set. i'd love to be that passionate about something. i don't care how trivial it is at this point. i just want to look forward to something or enjoy a hobby. everybody else seems to know so much about their favourite topic and they never seem to get tired of it. i just don't understand."
bipolar,adhd,94,"is ridiculous difficult when you have this stupid disorder. just my latest experience. i only work part time and am expected to work 15 hours per week. i have no idea when the last week was that i actually made it through that many hours. this has left me in a position where i will be unable to pay my bills in august if i don't get it together in july. at least i haven't been fired yet, though. i have been with the company since 2009, and it's only been in the past year or so that my condition has deteriorated to this extent. my head is buzzing. i dislike the major portion of the project i am assigned to this summer, and that is causing problems, as well. it's hard enough to find motivation some days when you *like* your job. one would think financial destitution would be a good motivator, but it's only serving to make me feel more overwhelmed and less able to concentrate. i'm tired of my psychiatric alphabet soup."
bipolar,depression,98,"i ordered a baby turtle! the backstory is that i had a turtle i found lost and wandering away from the water when i was about 8 and took him home and made a pet of him. he loved attention and ate from your hand, popped his head up every time he saw me. i loved him and was so attached. he died this fall, i'd had him for 24 years. i was devastated. i couldn't imagine not having him around. i found a website you can order turtles from and finally made the jump to order a baby turtle that looks just like him. i can't wait for him to come, i can see this really cheering me up."
adhd,anxiety,115,"every time i get into an argument/ debate i‚Äôm either a second away from crying or a second away from an angry outburst. it‚Äôs so hard to keep my cool and as a result... i learned to stop talking/ people please/ avoid the topic whenever things got heated. it‚Äôs a bad habit. i know this. because it‚Äôs a bad habit i decided recently to slowly start facing my fear of arguments/disagreements and the pain is just coming right back. it‚Äôs overwhelming. every single attack feels personal. it is so hard to keep my cool, and when i do? i end up feeling like shit for the rest of the day because i feel like i‚Äôve been rejected. everytime i feel rejected i suddenly think everyone is going to abandon me, and i get stuck in that feeling. i‚Äôm learning slowly and taking my time... but god does this shit suck!"
bipolar,adhd,116,"i‚Äôm in a good place in my life right now, and i finally found a good balance of medicine and therapy, etc. but i keep getting paranoid that people around me are going to wake up one day and dislike me or want to hurt me. i know that logically, most people (especially the people i surround myself with) are very upfront about their feelings. they‚Äôre all very caring and they love me. and if they have an issue with you, they‚Äôll talk to you about it. but because of my unmedicated days, and the days where i felt like i didn‚Äôt have quite so much control over my impulses or thoughts or feelings, i‚Äôve convinced myself that everyone has trouble with that. and that someday, they‚Äôll all leave in the same way that i walked out of people‚Äôs lives in the past. it makes it really hard to form meaningful relationships sometimes."
bipolar,ptsd,133,"i can feel the floor dropping out like the last time i was hospitalized. i can't go back there. it was traumatic. i've tried every med and i'm terrified. i turn into a fucking monster. i can't control it. i need help, but i don't wanna be sedated with meds and thrown in a cage. it feels like no one can help me. i just lost the love of my life and i don't know if i'll make it. idk what i'm expecting from this. i can't live like this. how do people make it? i can't believe i have to lose myself over and over until i die. i can't fucking do this. i'm so scared."
ptsd,bipolar,139,"i seem to get so agitated sometimes, whether it‚Äôs with my family or friends, and i‚Äôm just to afraid to tell people why. i just constantly feel worthless, and i‚Äôm always on depressed and on edge. i wish i could just tell people why."
depression,adhd,142,"that‚Äôs the best i can explain how i feel, i guess. it‚Äôs odd, but the only thing i‚Äôve felt for a while now, so is strangely comforting due to its consistency. i feel as if i‚Äôm very detached from my own body, and am sometimes taken aback when i see myself in a mirror and am reminded i am in fact a genuine, human person. my downright depressingly pessimistic view on the universe and it‚Äôs inhabitants - that it‚Äôs all fake, in a way, and everything is very much temporary, having no long lasting impact - probably doesn‚Äôt help this feeling. it‚Äôs not a lack of awareness; i‚Äôm almost hyper-aware of everything (sometimes called creepily observant). i don‚Äôt know how to describe it, really. justa constant star of being ‚Äúout of it‚Äù. i was just curious if anyone else feels the same way? let me know if you do and we can try and explain it to each other :)"
ptsd,anxiety,143,"the other day i or i should say we went on a 1st date with a woman i had just met a couple of days earlier. i say we, because my service dog was with me. after we had eaten, we were just chatting when all of sudden my dog jumps up and starts licking me. this is what she does when i start getting amped up. didn't train her to do it, she just does i had to get out of there. i could not sit still. i don't remember everything after the anxiety exploded. i don't remember driving home. i just couldn't think straight. i was short of breath. my heart was pounding. it had been such an amazing date up until that point. has anyone been thru anything similar?"
ptsd,none,144,"at 7:23pm my dad passed away five years ago today. i have been on edge all day. sneaking off to the walking fridge to cry when i don‚Äôt have too many tickets in the window. sunday‚Äôs are always hard because of brunch. staff and guests are always trying. i needed a moment and my boss told me to deal with it. i‚Äôm trying ok. i really am but there is a lot i didn‚Äôt get to say to him and a lot he didn‚Äôt get to do. he was an amazing scientist. it‚Äôs part of what killed him. he wanted to do a lot more work and research into diseases and the blood/brain barrier. but his lab forced him to retire early and he took it personally. he made the test for aids/hiv, hepatitis a,b, and c, west nile, and chagas‚Äô disease. i just want to tell him i love him one last time..."
adhd,bipolar,148,"hey everyone, can we talk about a serious topic for a moment? i want to hear the community's experience on masturbation and medication. **is anybody else experiencing porn addiction or extremely long fap sessions that are hard to stop early?** --- my story: i've always had some elements of porn &amp; masturbation addiction but it never got out of hand (pun intended) nor did it ever affect my life. i wouldn't have  way to overcome it or mitigate it, but failed. this week i've started nofap since my own personal measures didn't work. if i can't fix it myself by the next time i see my psych, it's too serious for me not to tell him about all this. --- **am i the only one that experiences this? do you guys have any similar experiences?** thank you for your thoughts or anything at all. i just ask that you keep it serious. thanks."
depression,anxiety,153,"i usually dont wash or fold unless i absolutely have to, so i typically look like a mess. having folded clothes made me a little more confident when i got dressed that i could make it through today."
anxiety,ptsd,163,"depersonalization/dissociating is the closest thing i've found to how i feel but not quite. i feel like i'm just floating through my days. like they fade into each other and i'm just trying to get through each one to make it into the next. i feel so unattached to my surroundings/environment, it makes me feel so awful. i don't feel present, but not necessarily in the ""you don't feel attached to your body"" way like depersonalization generally is described, but i just don't feel present. i don't know any other way to put it. i'm physically there and thats about it. i don't feel like i can relate to anyone either, so i don't bother going out of my way to communicate with anyone (say in a class setting) which just adds to the not-present feeling. what is this called, if anything? and what can i do about it? i'm so miserable"
depression,adhd,165,"it's almost the end of the 2010's, it was the last halloween of this decade and i did nothing, hell no kids do anything anymore. to think it's almost thanksgiving, then christmas, then it's over. i remember faintly the faces of peers from primary school. i wonder where they are, but that doesn't matter now. ""why are you like this? why are you so absent?"" because i don't belong anywhere on the face of the earth, time yells louder as peers begin to divide. in this hell i dwell in, i find myself having one thing life could never give me---certainty. i hate time, it's ran off somewhere without me and expects me to chase after it like some fucking dog. the ticking and the ticking of the clock is so loud, it taunts me and forbids me to think. i want to break every fucking clock i see, but even then i know i'll still hear the ticking, that fucking noise. my therapist once told me to just count down the minutes, i'm yet to have silenece at my door."
depression,adhd,166,"-- getting dressed is hard. -- getting shit started is hard. -- getting shit finished is hard. -- making tea... that's okay. -- drinking it, fine too. -- going to bed is hard. -- getting out of it is even harder. -- sitting on the computer, that's alright. -- getting work done, that's hard -- leaving the house, well i wouldn't know today. -- speaking is hard. -- laughing, that is good."
bipolar,ptsd,167,"i have lied to my friends and family for a very long time. it goes beyond the ""how are you?"" and ""fine, thank you"" dialogue. i lived with a smile on my face and i told myself that i was strong. i recently had an episode where i couldn't fake it anymore. i became really really sick. and now, the people i love are asking me questions because theyd never hurt her like that. my mom looked so shocked. i want to keep lying and putting up a face. but the truth is that i'm exhausted and really tired of acting like someone i'm not. and i know that my family and friends are asking questions because they want to understand and help me, but i want them to continue seeing me as ""smiley joojoobar."""
anxiety,bipolar,172,"i just noticed this a couple of days ago when i was messaging back and forth with my boyfriend the whole day. i had just finished volunteering at a crisis hotline and we we were talking about how i needed a recommendation letter from them for my social work degree program and he was saying ""it sounds like an intense program, but if anyone can do it it's my hat said ""he's going to break up with you way before that."" yesterday my boyfriend got way into this new game he got and he wasn't really paying attention to me or anyone or anything else really which just made more of those negative thoughts pop into my head like he doesn't love me. it was so bad that i couldn't sleep last night. i just need advice i guess."
adhd,bipolar,181,"dont buy chips, easy peel cheese wheels, crackers, ice cream, popcorn, anything you personally find bingeable. i used to be obese, never thought id get in control of my weight. long impulsive binges were my nightly vice. now, years later ive lost it all and am a normal healthy weight. turns out if i dont have quick access to convenience junk foods, i won't binge."
ptsd,adhd,182,i've seen three different doctors and none of them will give me my meds. i'm literally getting to the point i will just buy the pills off the internet and risk going to prison just to function. they keep trying to tell me there are other meds that help that aren't addictive. why do they keep telling me this fucking lie and why the fuck do they believe it!!! i guess i'll just drink to function because that's what these people fucking want. i want to strangle these fucking doctors.
none,adhd,189,"i constantly bump into different strange uses of ""would"" that i just can't understand. for example ""i tried to unlock the front door, but the door wouldn't open"" this is a situation that happened in finished in the past. this is not a hypothetical situation. ""would"" here doesn't mean a habitual past action. ""would"" here doesn't express willingness to do something. isn't it supposed to be ""i tried to unlock the front door but the door didn't open"". whyyyyy?"
bipolar,adhd,198,"i promised a friend i'd make a poster and a pin the tail on the donkey game for his kid's birthday. then i forgot - because my own kid had a school project that i threw all my free time this week into. i remembered thursday at work about the posters and started immediately. what i thought would take a few hours turned into, well, let's count. 3 hours last night, 30 minutes this morning, and i've been at it pretty intensely for the last 6 hours. now it's 4:30 in the morning, i have to drive it to his house before work, which starts at 9:30. i feel stupid for this. i also had a twelve hour work day yesterday and it's a job that requires tons of running. i hope they're happy with it all. if they're not... i guess i'll just have to accept that and know that i gave it my best!!!"
anxiety,ptsd,202,"i‚Äôve had the worst week of my life. pretty much lost the will to live. my anxiety has been at a all time high since i calmed it down a while ago. as seen via my last post i got sexually assaulted nearly 7 days ago and i‚Äôve been going off the rails ever since. i‚Äôve barely been sober and have been promiscuous which i‚Äôve never been before and i have no idea why after my assault all i want it for boys to respect me and say the right things before any sexual activity occurs. i had a boy say to me he wanted to get to know me before we had sex even though it was a one night stand and if it wasn‚Äôt for that nothing would of happened between us. it gave me at the time some false sense of security knowing i‚Äôm worth something and i‚Äôm not actually just a disposable machine that‚Äôs only good for one thing and that‚Äôs it? i went out last night and i‚Äôll spare the details as about 5 dknow a few of them don‚Äôt like me that‚Äôs evident and i‚Äôm not sure why because i‚Äôve not personally met any of them that don‚Äôt seem to like me, a lot of it has to be because of the guy i used to see and another guy i used to see who was also there. there was also drama as on friday someone slyly took a picture of me with a boy who had his arm around me who has a girlfriend (which i didn‚Äôt know) so everyone knows it‚Äôs me but they‚Äôre only not saying anything because the boy would fight all of them and probably win and his girlfriend showed up and punched him in the face and said he cheated on her, so i was quite a big topic of conversation in that apartment clearly and it‚Äôs giving me such bad anxiety i‚Äôm just worrying what people think of me and what was said about me i just don‚Äôt know what to do... i feel like i need to redeem myself but yet i‚Äôve just done nothing wrong?"
bipolar,none,205,"so i seem to be having issues with unichem pharmaceuticals lamtrigine and called my pharmacy, they told me that they could switch me to another generic but it would take an extra day to get it (i live in a large city so this may vary according to locality). they also asked me which one i wanted, so you can actually *choose* the company, if you know which one works best for you you can ask for it. ymmv depending on your pharmacy, mine is good. when i mentioned my issue they said i could switch without hesitation and ll of this information is new to them. so even branches in the same pharmacy chain can have wildly different experiences. it's nuts. i love love love my pharmacy! i'm scared that i'll lose them or the manager or pharmacists will change or something! i have seen different employees there but the quality of service is consistent. maybe it's strange but whenever something good comes along in my life i'm terrified i'll lose it and get thrown back to the wolves again. do people have things consistently good in their life?"
anxiety,depression,210,"i came into this year in a good place after years of wading through shit. i was kicking ass at my job, i have sorted a long term medical problem, i achieved dreams this winter by freeride snowboarding a mountain. i came out as bi / genderfluid to my family and it went well. but this year since then has fucked me up. i haven't touched another human in three months. i've been single for 12 years. i happening again every day recently. i don't want to see any more fucking therapists any more i hate the idea of it. i can't go through reopening all that painful old stuff again i don't want to deal with this bullshit any more. i don't want to burden my family with this, i've put them through enough. fucking 2020. its a good job i don't have a gun because its sure looking like a way to escape recently."
anxiety,depression,214,"i don't really have any friends in school and therefore nobody wished me a happy birthday today, so i was wondering could anyone wish me a happy birthday here, it would be really appreciated! thanks."
bipolar,adhd,215,"someone, seriously help me out here. i've masturbated 3 separate times today, two of which have been in the last hour, i've cum probably at least a dozen time, and i can not get any relief. within 20 minutes of finishing i have that feeling again and its so strain i cant concentrate to to my work. please, any tips for relief are so welcome."
adhd,none,218,"also i started the bulk of writing it three weeks ago! 25 chemical reactions ran, 9000 words, 80 pages, about 100 graphs created to visualize data, and another 40 illustrations of the reaction pathway. yay"
adhd,depression,222,"volunteer at a nature park. i did that once for school before depression made it hard to go to school. it was great, made me feel productive, helped me socialize, and made me happy. it is something i can do, believe in, and will be make me happy. :)"
ptsd,bipolar,231,"i believe we are stronger than the demons we face. i know it‚Äôs hard and sometimes it seems impossible. but we all can do it. just keep fighting and keep your heads up. love you guys. stay strong, stay sane, stay alive!"
depression,bipolar,240,"so, i was listening to the song ""in my life"" by the beatles (fantastic song, i highly suggest you give it a try if you haven't already) and going through old pictures and stuff (mainly screenshots and sfm's i made with my greatest internet friend circle that has unfortunately disbanded since year ago), and whereas the memories were nice, they made me severely and cripplingly depressed. i miss td by friends (even if most were online friends). now? now i'm corrupt with bad habits, cripplingly depressed, more lonely than ever, and i crave love that i seem to never be able to obtain. i miss the simpler times.. sorry for any typos, and sorry if this was oddly structured. it's past 1 am for me, and i'm tired as fuck. i just wanted to get this out and see if i wasn't alone. anyways, cheers.."
ptsd,anxiety,251,"we have a three year old who is, well, 3. she‚Äôs getting very difficult and we need to be firm and not let her run wild. problem: when my husband raises his voice at my daughter (mind you, this isn‚Äôt screaming. it‚Äôs not even words other than her name and ‚Äúno‚Äù) i save face and then end up losing it when i‚Äôm not in sight of my daughter. the sound of him yelling rings in my ears and just doesn‚Äôt stop. i end up having a panic attack and crying. i know i raised my voice too, but not as loud as him. this actually happens for other things. if he curses or raises his voice near me (annoyed while driving, or if we bicker) this starts happening. i start dbt group tomorrow. i‚Äôve never tried it. i hope i can find skills to deal with this. i had this under control for a very long time and then had it triggered in february. it just keeps getting worse."
ptsd,bipolar,257,i really need some support i‚Äôm feeling over the edge semi suicidal because i feel like i‚Äôm failing at everything. i can‚Äôt even make friends. maybe i am just a bad person. maybe everything my ex ever said was true. i just feel like such a failure and just have no enthusiasm to keep fighting. need some encouragement. i have no one.

depression,anxiety,270,i am from britain. my mum left when i was a baby. at school everyone bullies me because i live in a druggie neighborhood and i don't eat breakfast or lunch and my school uniform is too small that my pants are splitting and i found holes in my shoes . everyone thinks it's even funnier when i'm tripped up on my face and then call me a tosser. they bully me because my dad can't afford internet or school trips or breakfast . i know i shouldn't be posting here or even on here but i'm just in need of a friend to talk to. i am at school for like 15 more minutes which is how i am posting this. please be my friend i will go to the library later if i can if anyone is willing to talk to me .
depression,ptsd,272,"i deliver pizza. sometimes people will put silly things in the delivery instructions. a lot of 16-22 girls will casually sexually objectify us by putting things like, ""send the cutest boy!"" or something like that. i don't like it, but whatever. the drawbacks of living in a patriarchy is that teen girls can be gross leches and get away with it, i just try and do my job. we don't get to pick what orders we take. so i got stuck with one that said ""send your cutest boy"". i do not have very good self esteem. i once weighed close to 300 pounds, but through diet and a lot of exercise i've b ugly. and because of my self esteem issues...despite knowing this girl is a sexist asshole, i have felt like i'm about as attractive as a puss filled tumor all night. i could call this person up and let her know what her cruelty did to me. i could write all this up in a note and leave it at her door, but all it would do is make me look crazy because a 17 year old with bad skin and a terrible dress sense called me ugly and made me feel 2 inches tall after trying to sexually objectify me when i'm just trying to do my damn job. thank you for reading. you're a nice person and i love you."
depression,anxiety,289,"i had to turn in my notes for a class, and forgot that i had a bunch of private writing in there. my teacher saw it, showed it to my other teachers, and eventually the principal, who sent me to the school therapist... it was the most embarrassing thing i've ever had to endure. i was called up to the school therapist's office and she showed me some scans of the journal and asked me what was up. it was a series of self deprecating shit about how much of a cunt i am. she had me explain why i was feeling that way, etc. i was in that room for about 2 hours. sounds like an awful situation, right? it turned out to be one of the best days of my life (but somehow still awful).as bad about it? * it was uncomfortable * it was embarrassing. take the fact that this is the only positive post that i have put on this sub (not about me nearly taking my life, or hating it) and realize that there is actual help to be had. even when it's uncomfortable as fuck, as i have come to find out. i'm still not happy, or even content. but i'm more sensible with thinking about the shit that has been going on in my life forever, and am able to think of it with a more realistic perspective. if anyone has any more questions or any advise for people reading this, unsure if they want some guidance or not? please, by all means put something down below. thank you, all."

bipolar,anxiety,309,i got a cat almost a month ago. i got him because cats have been shown to help with anxiety. his favorite thing to do was to lay on my chest and purr while knocking my phone out of my hand to have me pet him. i looked forward to coming home every day to him. i made sure to put him first and always snuggled him to show him how much i loved him. but he kept getting sick. it finds out he had an incurable autoimmune disease. notice how everything is in past tense? that's because i had to put him down an hour ago. i don't understand how life has given me this many hardships in my life and especially 2 days before my birthday. all i wanted to do was spend it with him. i really do not know what to do. i'm just really sad.

depression,bipolar,325,i can't stand how people these days are patting themselves on the back for spreading awareness about mental health. there is still so much farther to go. we have not made nearly enough progress for complacency.
bipolar,adhd,326,a little while ago i made a post where i was wondering whether my adhd-like symptoms where caused by bipolar or if i actually have adhd. well i just got back from seeing my old therapist and she says she's 99% sure i have adhd inattentive. she told me to absolutely mention it to my pdoc at my appointment in august. i'm so happy to hear from someone certified that i'm not incompetent. hopefully i can make progress from here. i'm glad for some of the motivation you guys gave me in my original posts. thanks for reading
anxiety,depression,327,i had a little numbness on my left side of my chest now im kinda bugging out while at work. and i cant stop thinking about it just want to know if thats normal for anyone. edit thank you all for your responses glad to know im not the only one feeling this way. i hope that you all can feel a little better.
anxiety,depression,329,"tomorrow i bury my best friend who tragically passed away at the age of 25. i'm heartbroken and i will be speaking at his funeral. i am happy with the speech but i am nervous, petrified to mess up. he was an incredible guy and i want to send him off well, justify what he meant to me. my ex who broke up with me 2 months ago has kept contact to ask how i have been doing and if i ever needed anything go to her. i went to the gym yesterday evening just to pass the time and maybe work off a small hangover i was nursing from the night before. i felt okay but by the end of my session i was very tired. as i was walking back towards my flat i spot my ex with a guy next to her sitting down. i could have turned around but i didn't. i go up to her and say hi, she seems shocked to see me and asks if i'm doing okay. i say no, not really and say i'll leave them to it and say goodbye. as i walk down the road my ex has caught up with me after she runs to catch up with me. she says she has done this to tell me thatuy who has a family that makes her laugh, feel alive. this guy has a child. i recognise him from her xmas party. i'm really confused about why she chased after me. it's obvious she cares but is she feeling guilty, trying to spare my feelings in the hardest time of my life. i do want her back in my life but seeing her with another guy hurt big time. seeing them close to each other eating ice cream. she works with him, did she like him when we were dating. i also hate the idea of her sharing her sympathy and support with other people, especially a guy like that. and it hurts to hear her say to me he's going through a hard time. i'm going through the hardest time of my life. i feel like i can't use her as a crutch. i'm so confused, hurt, a mess. i bury my best friend tomorrow . i am absolutely terrified. i feel sick, like i'm going to mess up and ruin everything. the last 2 months has been the worst of my life, it just has. i want things to be better. i want him back. i want her back. i feel terrible."

anxiety,adhd,376,"whenever i sit at my desk i think of all the things i enjoy doing / should be doing (which includes hobbies) like reading, writing, journaling, studying language, and i am paralyzed by the decision. i try and weigh it up by things like 'well i haven't done this one in the longest time' or 'this one is most enjoyable' or 'this one would be easiest to get ""done""'. but i can't decide. and treating my hobbies like tasks is a terrible attitude. i spend all this time trying to find the objective best choice of way to spend my time that i waste that time, don't get anything done, and don't enjoy it. i'm too worried of making the 'wrong' choice. i have to keep reminding myself to stop prevaricating and just pick one and who cares about weighing factors or making practical choices. just choose one! but it's hard."

anxiety,depression,397,i feel drained and exhausted. every day. even when i exercise. i'm so lonely but no one ever hangs out with me or talks with me. most of my friends left and now i'm back to where i started. :/ i feel guilty to and idk why. i've never experienced this type of sadness before
depression,bipolar,399,"i'm an 18(m) who has sporadic depressive episodes. i've told some of my friends both indirectly and explicitly. and i always regret it. i hate the way they feel like they are treading on thin ice around me, but then i clearly desire attention if i told them in the first place. i've tried saying it to close friends (mostly when drunk) and also tried using fairly obvious forms of art as well. whatever i do, whoever i talk to, i wish i just stayed on my own. probably going to end up regretting this aswell."
ptsd,depression,417,i understand that it says more about them but i can‚Äôt help but feeling pain whenever i see yet another person that shows deliberate apathy towards me. everyone in my family and everyone i thought was my friend have been narcissistic. incapable of empathy.
adhd,bipolar,422,"something i see mentioned a lot in this sub is people mentioning thy carry their daily doses in pill containers on keychains instead of the prescription bottle. just wanted to remind everyone that these are controlled substances and illegal to carry without a prescription. i don't recommend carrying around a months worth of medication for anyone considering our tendency to misplace and lose things. we should however be aware that if for some reason a cop were to search us and we don't have proof of a prescription they are going to assume we don't have one. it can get really messy and end up in an arrest, a trip to jail, and a felony possession charge. obviously this charge would be dismissed once you show proof of prescription but please keep this in mind. a good way to have proof on you at all times is to take a picture of your pill bottle each time you fill your prescription since you always have your phone on you."
ptsd,anxiety,431,"i feel completely trapped in my own head. i've had that ""chair is about to fall backward"" feeling day in and day out for like three weeks now. it's becoming exhausting. i feel like a thousand screaming emotions are trapped behind a stone exterior. i can't cry or yell or write. i can't express any emotions, even for moms most of the time, it's just particularly bad right now and trying to out-logic my emotions is just overwhelming sometimes. right now is one of those times. you guys are my people and i guess i'm not really looking for solutions, just someone to remind me that it will pass and maybe offer up some tips on self-care."
depression,anxiety,433,"nothing is wrong in particular in my life, i have a couple things that are kinda down. but nothing i can say should be making me have such a bad reaction to it. if you want to know, i have started a new job and part of the job is night shift sometimes... but i know that flip floping day to night makes me very sick, but if i am permanent nightshift it doesnt bother me. i know i can talk to my managers but part of me would rather just find a new job. however i am finding myself thinking even worse than usual about cutting my throat open and bleeding to death. the image in my mind is quite graphic, more so than normal."
ptsd,anxiety,437,i've started to use cbd oil to manage my anxiety and i feel like a person again. i have energy to both accept any negative feelings i have and still put out a positivity to other people. which is something i struggle with when my anxiety is fully active since it pulls me down and it's difficult for me not to come off nasty when all my energy is spent fighting anxious thoughts and coping with the feelings it creates. i have an easier time talking myself down from my anxious thoughts and can function better in public in general. i can focus when i read and not forget things because i don't have my brain going a mile a minute. this stuff makes me feel like my life has changed drastically. i'm so grateful it exists.
bipolar,adhd,438,"i just want to thank all the great people out there i have ‚Äúmet‚Äù the past few days. i felt such a sense of loneliness, and this sub has given me renewed self worth. i have positive influences in my life, but never had people to talk to who live with this diagnosis. reading your posts, replying to them, getting feedback, gaining understanding, etc. i hope this string of good days continues. i hope the rest of you out there are putting some good days together as well, and if you are not, know you have a friend who is ready to listen. thanks again!"
ptsd,anxiety,449,"it‚Äôs been a long time, but i‚Äôve never been able to school myself into calm when i see something moving out of the corner of my eye. walking across a baseball field, basketball court, or anything with moving projectiles puts me on edge and every sound is like something being thrown directly at me. after a year of dating, it finally happened. my boyfriend made a gesture like pointing at me, with something in his hand. i flinched. as usual, jerked my head and closed my eyes. he held tightly to me, and told me over and over again (with tears in his eyes) how he‚Äôd never throw anything at me. ever. it just shows, after the many years of my life, i finally have a shoulder to lean on. and yours may not be far away, so please don‚Äôt give up."

depression,bipolar,466,i've been in a major depressive episode for the last two years or so and lately i find myself only brushing my teeth maybe once a day and showering only once a week. i was just wondering if anyone else struggles with this at different times during a depressive episode.
depression,anxiety,467,"does anyone else feel this way? this has been crossing my mind a lot lately edit: i just want to thank everyone for the thoughtful, kind comments i've been recieving. it's been a nice change and i really appreciate it. you guys are the best. :)"
ptsd,anxiety,470,"i was 21 at the time, now i'm 22. in may of 2017, i got really sick out of no where. in a matter of 3 days, i went from feeling slightly out of it, to intense thunderclap headaches, pale, body aches, delirium, and ultimately passing out. i didn't want to make a scene or go to the hospital because i was just starting a new full time job, but i had a feeling that i was going to die. i can't really explain that very well, but i just knew deep down that someone was very wrong. at 4am i took an uber to the hospital and when i got there, upon checking my vitals (very low blood pressure and 160 resting heart rate) the nurses helped me onto a wheelchair and wheeled me into a bed in the intensive care unit. at this point, my memory is very groggy but i remember multiple people helping me take my clothes off to change me into a gown, and then doing an ecg on me. they got an iv into me and gave me a valium injection, as well as nausea medicine. i thought that was odd because i didn't feel nauseous at the time. the doctor came in and asked me what was wrong. i just cried and said my head hurt so bad, adn't push me too hard my fist few weeks back (i have a very physical job). now i'm healthier, but i still have a constant fear of getting sick again. i try to explain this to my mom and friends, but they think i'm just being dramatic and a hypochondriac. i don't feel safe anywhere but the hospital. i'm constantly scared. i don't have a fear of death, but knowing that i could easily become diseased and suffer, and leave all that i love behind makes me sad. it makes me sad that people don't understand what i went through. they are not educated on sepsis and think well ""hey, she didn't have cancer"" (my coworker actually said that, and later attributed my sepsis to being a vegetarian). i really don't talk about it a lot, but when i do, i get eye rolls. it's like people think i enjoyed taking a month off work. i constantly suffer from panic attacks now, where i feel dizzy and can't breathe well, but there's not much i can do about that. ativan doesn't help. my body and mind have been through hell and no one understands, or gives a shit. thank you for reading, i just had to get this off my chest."
depression,adhd,473,"a bit of background about me: male, turned 25 last week. i just feel like i have nothing and no one to live for. i‚Äôve been really struggling lately. the people i count on to come and talk to when i feel like shit just flat out don‚Äôt answer my texts, so i‚Äôve stopped bothering texting them. the only girl i‚Äôve ever been into shot me down and also never answers my messages either. so i stopped texting her as well. no one bothers checking on me so why should i reach out to them? my aunt died from brain cancer 3 years ago. and my older sister was killed by a drunk driver. i was seeing a therapist but stopped because i couldn‚Äôt afford it. they care more about money than the health of their clients. america summed up in one sentence i guess. i dropped out of engineering school in october after 6 years of college and multiple majors, 6 classes shy of graduating because i just didn‚Äôt wanna do it anymore. i was burned out and sick of busting my ass with nothing to show for it but exhaustion and stress. i may or may not go back. my student loans are due starting in june which i can‚Äôt afford. i have a car payment on top of it, paying for a car that i never wanted in the first place with money that i don‚Äôt have. i only bought it to shut my parents up about it, because my other one which i much prefer wouldn‚Äôt pass emissions for a completely bullshit reason but ran and drove perfectly all the same. i just absolutely fucking hate being told what i can and can‚Äôt do with my own damn car that i pay for 100% myself. my car is my therapist and my favorite thing that i own. i‚Äôm working a dead end job with no room for promotion or growth, and coronavirus got me laid off indefinitely til the whole mess dies down. i cannot possibly be expected to pay for all that shit when they know damn well millions of people are losing their fucking jobs. it‚Äôs been a month since quarantine and i can‚Äôt really even leave my house. can‚Äôt have a social life. just feel like i have no oat he gave me his number. he walked back to the police cruiser and backed out, flashing his headlights at me to do the same. he followed me to the highway, turning off onto a side road and honking as he drove away while i got on the entrance ramp. i drove the 2 hours back home, not completely believing what had just happened and how he saved my life. i never even got his name or badge number. i got home close to 5 this morning and no one was up yet luckily. i snuck in and went to my room and slept for about 3 hours. i gave no indication to my family that i tried suicide the night before. no one knew that i went out last night. i still haven‚Äôt told them and i don‚Äôt plan to. they have no idea that i could‚Äôve died. i called the officer‚Äôs number and left him a voicemail thanking him again. he texted me later in the day saying his offer was still valid any time. i have no idea if he had to fill out any paperwork and don‚Äôt really want to ask. everyone has at least one secret that they‚Äôll take to their grave, and this is probably mine. it‚Äôs a long shot that he‚Äôll read this but if he does, i don‚Äôt know what to say to him or how to thank him. his compassion saved my life. it‚Äôs crazy to think what would‚Äôve happened if he had taken a different patrol route and hadn‚Äôt come along when he did. he deserves a promotion and to win the lottery. i owe him my life. cops get a bad rap for being arrogant, power hungry racists with itchy trigger fingers, but this particular officer represents what humanity should be like. we wouldn‚Äôt have people killing themselves if we simply stopped being assholes to each other. i don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs a department medal for talking a suicidal person off the ledge, literally in my case, but he deserves it. i could probably call his department number and get his name and send him something in the mail. not a bad idea. godspeed officer. i‚Äôll never forget this and how someone cared, and cared enough to actually do something about it."
depression,bipolar,474,"the shame and stigma that comes with being mentally ill can be very difficult to cope with, as most people can't see a crushed self like they see a broken leg. i have been going through the yet most difficult time, and what aches my heart is when i lose a friend or i feel the sucpesion of being lazy or acting up only se what i feel is taking life out of me every day, to many looks just like a failure at doing things right, or even if understood it still makes people undesirable and socially marginalized. so, is my thought common? or have i missed out on something that when i come to realize will make the thought sound preposterous?"
adhd,bipolar,479,"a 15 slide presentation and essay(5pages) about neurotoxicity, an essay about cystic fibrosis (12 pages), and an organic chemistry assignment all in two weeks! i thought i couldn't do it but i did. thanks to those who gave me plenty of tips on how to write more efficiently!"

adhd,none,487,i just got finished with an interview and as the boss was walking me to the door he asked me what kind of music i listen to. i had absolutely no answer. i listen to music every single day. i listen to new bands and artists every day. but yet i don't know what i listen to. i can't recall names or bands or songs or artists or anything. i love all genres too. i just know that when i turn on my spotify playlist something i enjoy will play. anybody else have this? i can listen to an album 100 times and not know what the album name is or what my favorite song off that album is called. it's so frustrating talking to people about music because i can't recall anything.
depression,bipolar,493,"i took a number of ssris during my last depressive episode and wellbutrin xl was the only one that made me flip into ""good days"" on occasion, however, would often slip back into depression after i went to sleep and woke up. i finally got out of my last depressive episode was during a ""good day"" where i got angry about flipping back to depression each time, that i vowed to wake up the next day feeling normal. strangely, it worked! i was feeling good for about 1 1/2 years, off the wellbutrin xl, and life was good. about 5 months ago, i fell back into depression and am taking wellbutrin xl again. hasn't done much but in 5 months, have only flipped into a ""good day"" twice where i feel normal, energized, have my motivation back and feel like my old self. i tried to get angry and vowed to wake up to being feeling good, but sadly, the next morning i was back to a deep depression. has anyone else had this experience?"
bipolar,depression,497,"you are climbing a mountain, it's hell, you want to give up , you push on and when you finally think you can't take another step, someone passes you on the way back down and tells you it's just 5 more minutes. a grueling ten minutes pass, you collapse on a rock and drop your pack. you see the summit. you lie on the ground for ten more minutes trying to shake out the last drops of water from the bottle into your mouth and they dribble down your face instead. you brought double the water everyone else did and it wasn't enoughiew was beautiful, you should see the view from the peak, it's amazing, so worth the trip, and you go wtf. you know night will come eventually, climbing up that mountain, never reaching the ""summit"", uncertain of how many hours you have left. only that night will come and then the struggle will end. stop making false promises that ""it will get better"". stop asking me to believe in fairytales. i don't want another false hope only to be shattered again like a glass falling to hard floor. i am so tired of picking up the pieces."

adhd,bipolar,558,"we all hate waking up and end up getting super alert at night, right? turns out that norephinephrine (one of the major things we are short on because it needs dopamine to make) is probably part of that. it is the thing that helps us become alert, increases steadily through the day, then resets when we sleep. so we wake up, are supet should, *and* norephinephrine helps regulate blood sugar levels, so we're more likely to be hypoglycemic zombies when we wake up in the morning, so we're screwed from multiple directions. ~~yes i have been geeking out researching neurotransmitters, why do you ask? don't worry, i'll have found a new fixation in a few more days :d~~"
depression,bipolar,559,"kinda shitty advice. but i'll start with some backstory. i'm on mobile so forgive me. (this will be kinda rambly) i was diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety disorder after i checked into a psychiatric hospital a few years back, but i always felt as i grew up that something was wrong. when i went to go meet my biological mother (who is very bipolar) when i was 18 things started to click with me that i needed to figure out a way to find meaning. it didn't help that my step-mom was an abusive cunt. so overall i kinda suck at being a person.(still do) anyways, i've struggled with constantly feeling down, and also feeling a whole lotta shit i didn't really understand. because of this i turned to weed and alcohol when i was 15. went through a few phases of drinking hard, but really weed was my poison of choice(still dont think it's bad but that's for another sub). again anyways because of the plant i kinda regained a sense of what it meant to be a healthy functioning member of society, but it was  pay the rent, things get complicated with family, with work, with life. and all of it together makes me wanna opt out. but then i think of leaving him by himself to deal with it himself and what a living hell that would be. even if i cant do much, ill do what i can till i can't. because if i dont that would make me sadder than anything i can ever encounter in my life. my point is that out there there are strong, amazing, incredibly intelligent and driven people, who do this shit alone. while feeling everything. and its heart breaking. my dad spent his life trying to make me feel welcome when every fiber of my being says i don't belong on this earth. the least i can do is gtfo bed and try to do something. even if my battle that day is just to brush my teeth. so that he can see a good looking smile that he made. to make him feel just a little better. that's my part, my mission. thats what gets me up. there are people that can use your help, and you owe it to them. but that s just my opinion."
adhd,anxiety,563,"i just came to complain honestly. i‚Äôve been trying to fall asleep for hours and i have to be up early and the fact that i have to wake up tomorrow morning stresses me out and then it makes it harder for me to sleep. i get so frustrated that people can just ‚Äúgo to sleep.‚Äù every time i put my phone away and close my eyes my mind just races with thoughts. sometimes anxious thoguhts, hypothetical scenarios, replaying conversations,  not even think it‚Äôs a panic attack, i can really only just describe it as just ‚Äúone of those nights‚Äù and it‚Äôs torture. not to mention i‚Äôve had like 2 different songs mentally playing while i‚Äôve tried to write this and lost track of myself while writing this post about three times. anyways thanks for reading if u made it to the end. it‚Äôs just comforting knowing that i‚Äôm not the only one bc it genuinely feels like i‚Äôm going crazy."

anxiety,bipolar,738,"couldn't think how to title this. i've got other issues but i'm thinking this one may be tied to my anxiety/panic problems (or maybe it just exacerbates them?) for example, i've noticed it most pointedly the past week while my cat's been sick. she's been to the doctor, i'm handling the practical stuff. but emotionally it's roller coaster. she seems to be feeling better (responding to meds and eating) and my mind's saying yeah, she's back. she seems a lil stiff andind won't stop telling me is definite even though the rational whisper knows i've never yet had to deal with the worst-case scenarios. i'm just wondering if y'all can relate? is this an anxiety/panic related thing? i've got some other issues (diagnosed bipolar and self-suspected mild asperger's) so i'm trying to define/understand what's going on with this catastrophe thinking because i deal with my issues/symptoms best when i understand better where they stem from."
none,ptsd,749,"i was recording the police while they were using same mouthpiece to check for *drinking under influence* during march. i felt that this is wrong to do while there is a contagious virus out there, you fucking don't know who's got it. one traffic cop sneaked up to me and held me while he called all his colleagues, 7-8 guys surrounding me. their leader screamed and yelled at much law exists and people know about it, it will make a significant difference because the police will have a sense of ""someone's watching me"" and could bring down police brutality. edit: deleted the video, it made me feel uncomfortable having it in my gallery. i had nightmares about how it could have gone more wrong, for a week. you know it's bad when police gives you ptsd."
depression,none,751,"sometimes, i hear this man. only in the stillness of night does he descend. ‚Äúyou‚Äôre alone,‚Äù he teases. ‚Äúyou‚Äôre isolated,‚Äù he taunts. ‚Äúyou‚Äôre nothing,‚Äù he mocks. i‚Äôve never quite liked him. but still, i keep him around. sometimes, it‚Äôs just nice, ya know? hearing a human‚Äôs sound."
bipolar,adhd,752,"third week of school. one class has an attendance policy of forfeiting all attendance points if you miss more than two classes. i mean, attendance is 40/420 pts so it could be worse. i guess. just gotta blow them away with my assignments... i‚Äôll start by drinking this bottle of vodka. fall 2019 is not going as planned."
anxiety,adhd,757,"hey all, i've noticed recently that i've been putting things where they don't belong, or opening cabinets to look for things that i know are in another cabinet. i'm 20. sometimes i'll be walking and i'll have to ask myself ""where am i even walking to?"" then i have to think about what time it is and what day it is and say ""oh, i'm going to english class."" or sometimes i'll be sending a text and something else will happen and i'll put the phone down only to open it up later and realize i never sent the text. appointments slip my mind constantly or i'll remember that i never went somewhere i was supposed to and then think about it and think ""wait, yes i did do that/go there."" it's really scaring the shit out of me. anyone else have these types of memory lapses?"
bipolar,adhd,764,"it's happening again. time has slowed by the tiniest of fractions all the infinite of paths have become slightly less infinite, and slightly less impossible impossibility is eroding...again yesterday's tasks, which seemed so heavy, so futile, so devoid of hope are now infused with the knowledge that all tasks are as light as you make them, as important as you deem them, and hoping that this feeling can stay it's happening again. time is reminding me that it can't cease to exist the click of time's tongue can change it's tone depending on how i choose to unwrap it's gifts like friendship, it can never leave you, it can never speed up, it can never enour nothingness my ego claims the well-known eyes are kinder with their gaze, but it knows better they know better i know better. it's happening again. the arena of my mind changes with each breath, with each thought from challenge to shelter to prison to dead end my arena transforms until it doesn't until it's a step behind until it's steps behind it's happening again. my mind cannot keep up with my arena my arena will not keep up with my mind the clock ticks slower now until it doesn't. time is up. the focus is narrowed. the narrowed is focused. this is all gibberish nonsense...time has changed it all. impossibility is growing. it's happened again."
ptsd,anxiety,766,"slithering around, i can sometimes feel it wrapping around my thoughts. sometimes it'll tempt and induce fear that it may strike and then sit back, other times it will strangle and constrict my thoughts, biting and injecting it's venom into my thought circuit. i feel like there's an ever elusive way to drive it out of my head, that frustratingly isn't a concrete, logical method to do."
depression,bipolar,768,"it's getting hard for me to remember a lot of things and my brain is always foggy. i had a job interview earlier and i could have sworn i heard the manager say that *she'll* give me a call this afternoon, and i haven't heard anything from them, and now i'm having a miniature crisis because i don't know if that's what i actually heard or she actually said *tomorrow afternoon* or she said she wanted *me* to call this afternoon or tomorrow afternoon or if i heard her correctly and she just didn't bother to call me and gave the job to somebody else. this is so fucking frustrating, i feel like i can't trust my brain and it makes me feel like an idiot. please tell me meds can fix this..."
depression,adhd,771,"does anyone else ever feel like... they aren‚Äôt doing things for enjoyment but they‚Äôre just doing manual controls of themselves bc they have to? ‚Äú okay now it‚Äôs time to eat. okay that‚Äôs done, now it‚Äôs time to lay down. okay that‚Äôs done, now it‚Äôs time to see your friends‚Äù but everything really just feels like you‚Äôre going through the motions without any real enjoyment?"
depression,anxiety,780,"i hate it when my ""friends"" say this. i don't know if they don't care or don't know how to help or if they genuinely believe this. i've also gotten comments like ""stop being sad"" or (for my anxiety) ""stop worrying."" i don't know if people don't take me seriously or just don't want to. i ask for help, and no one answers (anymore, i pushed away the one person that did care about me and it kills me). i've just retracted into my own shell. no one understands the pain i feel (as edgy and cliche as that sounds) and i don't think anyone will even bother to try ever again. i don't fit anywhere. i don't belong here. i feel like at this point i'm just delaying the inevitable and that, if i did go, no one would miss me. no one would even fucking notice..."
depression,anxiety,783,i feel like shit mentally and physically and i'm terrified :( and all at the time when i have received horrible news.. edit: thank you everybody who has commented and whoever else might want to share their experience. every single one of you has alleviated my depressive thoughts and anxiety. thank you. i hope this post has done the same for some of you aswell.
depression,anxiety,789,"you know the sound a plastic cup makes when you squeeze it too hard? when you are standing and talking to people and you look normal but you are trying so hard not to scream or cry or break down in front of everyone so instead you tighten your grip on your cup. you hear the sides crackle as they cave in. once you release, the cup pops back into its original shape but there are still white lines running down the side from where it bent. i feel like i am making the crackling noise and i am covered in white lines. it is stupid but it seemed fitting."
anxiety,adhd,793,"i'm having a really weird time right now. i'm going to preface this by saying i make significantly more than a lot of people, but i'm just learning to be responsible with it as of recently. in trying to save towards my goals (studying / teaching in japan) i found that it'd take me about 6 years to save up what'd it'd cost to do it. it's a lowish amount, about 20k, but i learned that my ceo males that in an hour the other day and it's been eating at me. i feel horrible because i just can't get the thought of my dreams and aspirations would take someone else an hour to achieve. just... yeah. sorry to rant. i'm down tonight. going to apply for a few more part time jobs. i hate being impatient like this."
depression,anxiety,794,"it‚Äôs been 4 days since my last suicide attempt. maybe 5-6 days since i stopped self harming, and a day or two since i completely stopped having everyday thoughts of death. yesterday, i took my first bath since this had started and i‚Äôm proud of myself. i no longer deal with this constant sadness and heavy feeling everyday, i no longer deal with anxiety always being up my ass telling me i would be better off dead. i‚Äôm starting to get back into the habit of things, and slowly becoming the person i was before. all i can say in the end is fuck anxiety and fuck depression. all they did was drag me down and i‚Äôm so glad to be strong enough to make it through."
anxiety,adhd,799,"posting this is extremely nerve-wracking, but hey, i'm doing it! oh. my. god. i actually did it you guys! 6 months ago my psychologist convinced me to take an online english class... i was so reluctant and was about to quit more than a handful of times, but despite crying my eyes out my psychologist wouldn't let me quit. she knew i could do it, and i'm so thankful she didn't enable me when i wanted to run the other way. i owe this woman everything. it's been 7+ years since i finished school, and this is the only thing i have accomplished since then. it was without a doubt hard and it felt impossible at times, but i'm so proud of myself now - something that rarely happens."

adhd,none,807,"i see your, our, struggle. evolution made us this way for a reason. we have a purpose. but it's really fucking hard to find that in this fucked up modern society. imagine. lots of nature(yes the planet has nature). a brand new start. let everyone be free from the wrong kind of responsibilty. let everyone gravitate towards their natural talents and skills, let people be passionate. no schedule. no shaming of bad structure or organisation. ok maybe bring a handful of neurotypicals for the paperwork. yeah i'm in total denial of the world we actually live in. too painful to face the truth."
depression,anxiety,812,"sleep is the only time i feel okay. i feel like i have vivid, colorful dreams where i actually feel happy but i wake up and it‚Äôs back to reality. but i‚Äôm in a constant struggle between staying up late so i can delay the inevitable of going back to work and sleeping longer. sometimes if i wake up in the middle of the night i just stay awake so i can ‚Äúdelay‚Äù going to work. i lie awake for hours, checking the clock every fifteen minutes... ugh... someone help me omg"

depression,ptsd,815,"my 17 year old son committed suicide six months ago. it was frustrating for me to read the top thread here today. people did care. his friends cared. his dad, me and his two brothers cared. we supported him. we got him help. we listened. we hugged him a lot. i spent hours and hours in conversation with him. it wasn't a burden. he had a unique perspective and was wise beyond his years. he was never seen as a burden. we didn't patronize him. we didn't tell him stupid nonsense. we did our best to understand. when he was having a bad stly because we miss him so much but also our resulting trauma. even so, i hold no anger towards him. i still cry every day. so much of who i was, was tied to being his mom. i'm at sea as to what meaning and purpose i now have... anyway, i wrote this to mark the anniversary of the last time i looked into his beautiful blue eyes only to see the spark that made him a compassionate, intelligent, loving soul was gone. also, to dispel the idea that all suicides happen to people who were not loved and/or supported. thank you for reading."
anxiety,bipolar,818,"i‚Äôve been working for about 7 months, this is the longest i have held down a job. i‚Äôve gotten a car and started driving for the first time and going places by myself, i‚Äôve made friends and have learned how to talk to people better, i‚Äôve opened my first credit card and started keeping track of bills. i‚Äôm still somewhat anxious but have learned to control it better, i‚Äôm currently struggling a little bit as a new driver but i‚Äôm sure i‚Äôll get the hang of it. i just thought i‚Äôd share for anyone who is still struggling. 7 months ago i was completely lost and now i know what‚Äôs best for me."
depression,anxiety,832,"ever since i was little, i was always that odd person that would try to put herself into situations in order to socialize and have a group of ""friends"". i was always left out because of this and they actively tried to avoid me. i just gave up trying to make friends for a long time until i hit high school. i was se\*\*\*lly a\*\*aulted when i was 14 and i was scared to do anything or be alone, so i broke out of my anti-social shell and mat feel like i'm a failure to my parents because i'm not as outgoing or social as my brother is or my cousin is. i always say, ""at least i'm not out doing drugs"" just to make the situation seem less sad. it doesn't work and i just feel sad and alone. how do you make friends that stick because i'm tired of just sitting in the house, looking at peoples' stories, and feeling envious that i don't have a group of friends to do stupid shit with."
ptsd,bipolar,833,"i‚Äôm so tired of having bad memory, it makes me feel so stupid. i‚Äôve been watching the star wars movies with my boyfriend for the last week and i can‚Äôt remember hardly anything. i get the basic plots but names and details are always lost on me. i have to ask questions the whole time and it‚Äôs genuinely creeping out my boyfriend. he doesn‚Äôt understand how i can forget a detail from 20 minutes ago. i‚Äôm just sad. i use to have great memory and now i can‚Äôt even enjoy entertainment. i just feel like a shell."
bipolar,anxiety,834,"i've noticed a theme in my negative thoughts about myself in the last year has been a focus on this idea that i'm a failure. it's something i think all too many of you can relate to, and something i hereby challenge you to do with me. i'll do it in the comments so it doesn't overshadow your accomplishments (because i want to hear about them and be proud of you!) or turn into nk of other things i've done i can be proud of, and maybe it'll help us see some of the awesome things you've done in life that you might not appreciate for its level of awesomeness. so...what in life was hard for you that you managed to do anyway? what was something you did that's been hard for other people that wasn't hard for you? what've you worked at? stay awesome, folks."
depression,anxiety,835,"which is wack, because we're all a bunch of strangers hiding behind usernames. but this is such a common theme for me. for example, if someone passes me on the freeway, i immediately assume it's because that person is angry at me and wants to run me over. where is this line of thinking coming from? is it anxiety? i've been depressed for 13 years and this ""everybody hates me empirically"" has only surfaced in the last 1-2 years. anyone else deal with this?"

ptsd,anxiety,840,"i‚Äôm not sure if this is just general anxiety or an emotional flashback. but sometimes i‚Äôll just get randomly super uncomfortable, and i can physically feel it in my arms and knots in my stomach. it‚Äôs almost as if i‚Äôm feeling violated for no reason and all i want to do is put a giant sweatshirt on and curl into a ball. it happens at super random times like sometimes just sitting in my room alone or out with friends or family. it really ruins my day and is overwhelming but i haven‚Äôt heard anyone else talk about it."

depression,ptsd,856,"i came home from work and my husband had moved out. we had been together for more than 15 years. no desire to discuss what went wrong, no chance of reconciliation, no warning... he was just gone. i‚Äôve had mdd for 9 years following a traumatic brain injury. now i‚Äôm in the deepest depression i can imagine. i‚Äôve been hospitalized. i‚Äôve been thru 7 weeks of outpatient. i can barely get myself out of bed. i f how long until everything physically starts falling apart around me because i‚Äôm not functioning and i‚Äôm alone in this house. i try to keep it clean. i care for my pets. i try to talk to someone every day so i‚Äôm not completely isolated. i‚Äôm working part time again and slugging thru it. it‚Äôs torture. i just needed to share this with someone other than my journal. the struggle to just survive is so painful."

""all my life, i have never been anything other than ordinary. i have never been exceptional in any way. i have never been pretty, or particularly intelligent, or good at sports. i have never been anything over than ordinary. average. i am okay with this. most people really are ordinary. however, i am kind. and generous. i am passionate and considerate and whilst i can be selfish, i am often selfless. i don‚Äôt bully or harass others. i vent sometimes abohe same story. over and over and over again. i am weird. different. unlikable. friends often turn on me, abandoning me for different reasons i am yet to understand. some i never will. and i don‚Äôt understand. i really don‚Äôt. what is it about me that is so wrong? what do i do that makes people dislike me? what am i missing? do i do something wrong? do i say something wrong? is it the way i act? behave? am i blind to my faults, so much so that i can‚Äôt see them? i just want to be liked. i want to have friends. i want to know that the friends i have in my life aren‚Äôt going to suddenly abandon me, too. i want to know what is so damn wrong with me that people hate me on such a frequent, regular basis. because this feeling is killing me. and it makes me want to die."" caring for her can be hard but there is nothing more worthwhile that i can do. i'm hoping there is someone on here who can relate with her? if that's you, what do you wish someone had said to you? thank you"
depression,anxiety,864,"when you have depression or anxiety aging feels 10 times worse. i‚Äôm 21 and i feel incredibly old already. i suppose the worst part is that when you are a kid in highschool people always say that life ‚Äúgets better‚Äù and of course the media really hypes up your early 20s as the best time in your life. i am very socially isolated with no friends. all i do is attend community college and feel like a failure... yet this is the so called ‚Äúprime of my life?!‚Äù i find it depressing that my physical peak is coming and going so quick. i feel like i have no control over time - i constantly worry about how fast it‚Äôs passing and i‚Äôm not afraid to make life changes due to anxiety. i know , life doesn‚Äôt end when you turn 30. but for someone like me who probably never will get married or have kids aging seems hopeless. my body will decompose all while i get forgotten about by the world. hell, being lonely at 21 sucks enough i can‚Äôt imagine being lonely and isolated at 40+ ."
ptsd,depression,865,"i have this regularly and destroyed my social life once again a while back. i pushed away all people i love and lost basically every human connection. i feel like i'd just justify my behavior when explaining it to them and manipulate others into giving me another chance when i'll most likely do the same thing all over again in a few month/years. when i'm in such a state, i can't control it. i lose every human feeling and any empathy left in me. i don't think it's ever going to be any other way, so i don't care anymore. i'm starting to think that i should stay in this totally emotionless state just to stop hurting my loved ones."
bipolar,ptsd,869,"i know it doesn't seem like a big deal, but my room has been squalid lately. i was terrorized by a huge cockroach last night. i heard it scurrying around, but alas i could not find it because my floor was covered in clothes, empty wine bottles, bills i can't pay and random pills strewn about. the stank of shame hung heavy in the air, or maybe it was just my dirty laundry. i don't know. anyway, i think i'm doing better today. i don't feel as abjectly miserable as i normally do. i honestly feel like sisyphus most days. maybe the wellbutrin is finally kicking in? ü§î friday would have been my two year anniversary with my fiance, but he left just like everyone else. my faith in humanity has been annihilated,cted me because i had substance abuse problems. thank god and fuck you dr. hahn. üñï anyway. things are looking up for me. i have been in deep despair since september of last year. i've never been consistently... depressed? for that long. i hesitate to call it a depression, because my typical depressive symptoms aren't present. i don't really know what exactly is the matter with me. ect fried my brain, that's all i know. so that happened. maybe it was a positive thing since i haven't tried to off myelf since the procedure, yet everything feels so foreign to me. i can no longer identify what sort of episode i'm in. i just feel... numb. if unseasoned chicken breast was a feeling, that's how i'd describe it."
bipolar,ptsd,878,"monthly appointment with my doctor again. so i was a little worried about feeling this weird ""not caring"" on some things that i usually do. so i brought it up when he asked, is there anything you want to bring out? i told him that i find it strange when i'm supposed to be angered in a situation and i feel like i don't care anymore. i can't figure out the reason why but i just choose automatically to not care. there are also other aspects but it's more difficult to illustrate. so he asked me, is that good or bad? i replied, that's the issue, i don't know. i'm not sure if it is good or bad. i said maybe imm just tired of being stressed. he smiled and i was surprised when he said, then it's good that you are becoming resilient to daily stress."
depression,anxiety,886,"everyday in high school i see people who can be engaged in certain classes and discussions out of what seems like interest. sometimes i see or hear about a student who went above and beyond on something. or, at the very least, i notice people who can do work and study for tests reasonably ahead of time. every time i see one of these things i feel jealous, sad, and sometimes almosly interested in any of them. college is coming next year, and i have no idea what i'm going to do, or if i even have the motivation to make it through. it's been difficult enough pretending like i care in high school. any kind of work is just a massive mental chore to get through. if it weren't for my massive anxiety and fear of falling out, i probably wouldn't get anything done."

anxiety,ptsd,911,"my doctor and counselor have me listed as extreme anxiety and depression, early childhood ptsd, bi polar, borderline personality disorder. it's a relief to have an answer to what my problems are. this has been an on going problem my whole adult life. my first job, i had reasons for being depressed. i dropped out of school, parents were divorcing and i didn't have a stable housing situation, i was falling behind and depressed, full of anger and anxiety. i didn't want to call myself weak though and admit i had a problem, so i attempted to self medicate by escaping reality. i skateboarded, played video games, drank, smoked weed, partied, did everything i could to feel numb. 5 years later, because i didn't seek help or medication early on, i was put on suicide watch due to my new medications not worki application. my point to all this is i would be homeless and probably dead without her. she has saved my ass countless times over the years,having a mental illness makes holding a job so fucking difficult, i've lost at least 6 jobs since being with her. i have nothing but respect and love for her to be putting up with all this, while we are both still fairly young (i'm 24, she's 21 later this year) i wish her parents understood mental illness, but it's kind of a taboo in her family so we keep things as vague as possible. i just hope that i get through to disability services and can make an income that way, to relieve some stress from her life. she put off school for me from the very beginning, the least i can do is help her get through school. sorry about the rant. i hope everyone has a great day."

bipolar,anxiety,924,"i started new meds a few weeks ago, and i think i found a good combination that works for me. i don't wake up wishing i was dead, i don't get irritable as much and i can go out in public without becoming super anxious. it's been harder to fall asleep and i have a few other small side effects, but they're not terrible. it's just nice to not be in a terrible mood 24/7. i hope others can find medications that work for them too!"

bipolar,depression,938,"i'm so bored with my life. everything i do does not give me any satisfaction whatsoever ex: trying to be social, reading, watching movies etc. i just can't pay attention nor do i really want to. all i ever want to do is sleep because i'm so bored... been sleeping about 14 hours in total each night/day. i know i am in a severe depressed phase right now but i used to cry and feel emotions... now i just lay in bed, try to watch movies etc (can't sit through anything) and wait until i can go back to sleep. it's really sad actually ... that being said, i am a college student who is failing two classes because i really do not care to go to class because i can't even pay attention there so i feel like its a waste of time. does anyone ever feel this way? i know what depression is like but being absolutely emotionless is new... i don't really know what to do"

bipolar,anxiety,961,i've been struggling to rationalize myself right now. i have thoughts to hurt or kill myself. or walk for hundreds of miles. that my family and friends hate me that they are judging me and laughing behind my back. i feel like i constantly have to reassure myself that these perceptions aren't real. i have coursework i'm doing for an online course i really want to pass. i don't want to fail.fail.fail.fail.fail. i don't know how to control this my speech is being affected by this either too fast or slow and slurred. this anxiety has to stop now.
bipolar,anxiety,963,"sorry for the rambling post. i just need a safe place to vent. i'm pretty much losing it. i haven't been to work all week because i'm crippled with anxiety and i've been super irritable, lashing out, experiencing hallucinations, and have been feeling incredibly suicidal. last night, my fiance had to basically sit on me to make sure i didn't hurt myself. i begged him not to bring me to the hospital. i think i should go to the hospital to get stabilized but i don't know if it will do much good as i know that when i get out i won't be able to afford the medication they'll put me on and i'll be back to square one. i'm sorry. i just feel so overwhelmed right now."

anxiety,ptsd,977,"my wife passed out from a panic attack yesterday in the theatre while we were watching *a quiet place*. i was so scared and didn't know what to do. about an hour into the movie, there's a scene where someone steps on a nail. it wasn't even very gory, but i guess it triggered some bad memories for her. a few seconds after that scene, my wife's arm started twitching kind of like a seizure. at the same time, she started making sounds like she was snoring or maybe choking. when i looked at her, her head was lolled to the side and her eyes were closed. not realizing what was happening, i nudged her a bit, thinking she had fallen asleep. when her head rolled to the other side and there wasn't any other response my concern sky-rocketed. i took her head in my hands and gently shook her a little bit trying to wake her up. her eyes partially opened, and i could see her pupils were looking up like when you roll your eyes. there was no other response. i tilted her head forward and the ""snoring"" sound stopped, but she was still unconscious. at this point, about half a minute or so had passeder feel safe. i tried to just hold her and comfort her. after about a half hour she was doing better. i felt so helpless when she was unconscious. it's very scary when you suddenly realize your loved one is having a medical emergency. later in the evening, she revealed to me that when she was a teenager, she had an abusive boyfriend that would rape her, cut her with a scalpel, and poke her with needles. sick stuff like that i guess. she wouldn't say much more about it than that. i am angry. not at her, but at the thought some sicko did this to her. and i hurt. i grieve that she has experienced something so traumatic it causes this type of thing. she agreed we will get her into some therapy. she needs healing that i never knew she needed. i also know this isn't about me, but i feel a bit hurt this is just now coming out. we've been married about 5 years, and i never knew this stuff. what else don't i know? i don't know what type of advice i'm looking for. how can i be there for her? how can i help? what do i do if this happens again? did i do the right thing both during and after?"

ptsd,adhd,1074,i bought a couple of bluetooth led lights from homedepot for around $15 each. through their app i setup 'schedules' that automatically dim the lights slowly on and off in the morning and at night. when my alarm goes off in the morning the light has been slowly dimming on for 10 mins and usually i am already awake. at night i don't realize why i am suddenly sleepy until the light is almost off. i still have plenty of nights of insomnia but it has helped me create a better routine and it helps so much that it happens automatically. anyone else tried something like this?

bipolar,adhd,1128,"so in the title, within quotation marks, are what i've heard from people i spent the most time with. 1) my mom, 2) a now-ex boyfriend, and 3) a former friend. 1) my mom kinda blew up in the parking lot of a hospital. the doctor said i didn't need a cough pill for my infection, and would be fine with only the prescription she gave me, and then my mom asked if she could prescribe me with a cough syrup. the doctor agreed to prescribe a strong cough syrup, and i asked if i don't need a cough pill, ""do i need cough syrup?"" the doctor said no, but said ""the medicines won't react with one another,"" and ""if you want a cough syrup, i can prescribe one."" *but i don't.* my cough won't go away (respitory infection) until the steroids kick in, but it will go away. i don't like taking meds i don't need. i'm defensive about this, because every time i have respitory issues, my mom asks the doc for a cough syrup ""for my own good"" and i feel like shit bc it's got some depressive drug in it, and i feel ultra sluggish the morning after i take it. i don't need it so i'm adverse to taking it. my mom says it's ridiculous that i have a cough and won't take a cough syrup, when no cough syrup was prescribed or suggested. the steroids will take it's course. but mothers will be mothers. i just hate taking drugs i don't actually need. (and i'm 18 so i'd think the doctor would have asked me first. guess not.) anyway she called me ungrateful and wouldn't let me speak and i dunno. it hit me. she said: ""i'm better off dead than i am alive to you, because nothing i do as your mother makes you happy."" i wanted to shoot myself in the mouth right there and then, ngl. i know that isn't the (logical) answer to this, but she isn't the only one who's said stuff like this. 2) my ldr boyfriend of two years broke up with me last night. he says he doesn't feel like he can talk to me, because he says offhanded things, and for a while, i didn't address them until months later (which is toxic). and now he feels that he'll fuck up no matter what he does, so what's the point. in the past i've addressed things as they came up and he either made fun of me, got super defensive, or asked ""so what's the problem?"". for example: he didn't speak to me for long periods of time. for like. a year. cancelled majority of skype dates at the last second. i said that i knew he has other obligations, but that still felt a bit emotionally neglected. (being left on read for days and sometimes weeks, not hearing from him for months, reading an ""i love you, too"" from him was rare. i felt like he didn't like me.) but he said that i had no reason to believe that. he had a roommate who made me cry, and he didn't defend me. even if i say that i didn't appreciate a comment, he would just join him. of course, he didn't mean to be rude, and of course he didn't mean to overlook my crying, didn't mean to misunderstand me. but he refused to buy earbuds because of his ""indispoable income"" (even if he went out to drink once a month). which gave his roommate ammo to be a bully. so i mailed my then-bf earbuds and he lost them. it felt as if he didn't put any effort into the relationship, and was justifying himself. when i asked if he wanted to break up, he sounded surprised and confused as to why. said that he loves me. i wasn't angry, just hurt and confused with all the mixed messages. but i said i believed him and ignored my gut. plus, on holidays, he drives six hundred miles in one go to visit me (and his family. so contrary to what he says, i'm not the only reason he comes to the city i live in.) but he said ""you think i wanna see my family? barely anyone there wants to see me. i'm driving for nine hours straight just so see you. of course i love you."" he gave multiple examples of his responsibilities, asked if i understood, and still asked what the problem is. i couldn't teents to me and to other people. i understand how depression can be; but that doesn't excuse her from being mean. from playing rough and with scissors (as a seventeen year old). from going out of her way to patronize people. but she put on her snapchat story her suicidal thoughts, talking about how everyone she knows is against her. so i swiped up, let her know that i apologize if i wronged her, and that i want her to be okay. that i don't think anyone is against her. that i am here if she needs to talk. she said that i can't make her pity me, and i was baffled. that she doesn't have the energy for my bullshit. (yikes.) that i shouldn't play nice if i don't feel nicely about a person. (still don't know what's she was talking about but it was childish. but still yikes.) and then she said all i do is complain about my family problems and boyfriend and do nothing to fix it. (that was when i said ""good to know,"" and blocked her. hehe.) it's so funny that she *asked me* what's wrong, didn't accept ""nothing"" for an answer, and then secretly hated when i was open and honest. i thought she was my friend. but i guess only therapists are meant to hear your problems. anyway. i digress. days after i blocked her, she came around me in person. went out of her way to sit next to me. acted fearful, as if i would reject her. took every single chance she got to be overly nice. for example: i was presenting and the class (of 13 people) was talking over me. she stood up, cupped both hands over her mouth, and projected: ""everyone! chris is talking! it is important to hear what they say, so that they can finish their presentation!"" sat down, then grinned at me. the class had the same weirded-out expression as i did. like. ugh. that was so artificial that it hurt me. i have a floridan friend who i tell some of these situations with, and he says it sounds like the other person has some unsolved problems of their own. my therapist said the same thing about all three scenarios. that nothing i complain about is like. ""i'm so sad my dad got me a blue car. i wanted a red one."" y'know? like the problems that bother me are literally ""so i'm homeless and don't know where i'm sleeping tonight "" or ""i got 27 spider bites in my sleep"" or ""my mom is threatening to kick me out and i'm an unemployed student"" or something that can't be given advice, because it's totally out of anyone's control. like when my car got totalled and i kept having flashbacks about the crash throughout the day. i couldn't sleep at night. for weeks. or when three of my classmates died. or when i was in a sexually abusive relationship for six months, got assaulted everyday on school grounds, and didn't tell anyone for eight months. i have flashbacks and awful dreams about *that* one to this day. but i don't say anything until someone asks me what's wrong. and even if they do, i'm reluctant to say so. bc none of this can be hugged better. it's heavy. it's uncomfortable and nobody wants to hear it. those are the only things that get to me. those are the things i go to therapy for. but my therapist doesn't believe in dwelling on (talking about) past traumas and griefs. i don't know what anyone wants me to do anymore. do i just let go of *everything*? i do not exagerrate; these things happened in the same twelve months. i'm not trying to excuse my complaints, but, yikes. i don't know what to make of any of this. anyway. tldr: nobody i open up to stick around. are all of these situations like. situations where both parties have made acceptable mistakes in handling their situation? or am i this unhappy person who makes people miserable because i complain so much? am i ungrateful? am i being crazy for saying the things i do? does anyone else hear statements like these from people who see you the most? it's times like these that makes self destructive behavior so easy."
depression,bipolar,1129,this is becoming a problem. this is not the first time this has happened either. i am surprised i have not been fired. i just can't get up. i am so unmotivated. help! what can i do?
anxiety,adhd,1131,"this is an idea i've been sitting on for about 3 months and now i'm willing to do it. i see posts about people having no friends and how making friends is hard all the time and i get it, i'm in that boat too. so i want to reach out to the people who would like a complete stranger to check up on them at a completely random time over the next 31 days. if you leave your username i'll go through, when i'm bored, and send you a private message asking ""are you ok?"" you can reply with one word, yes or no, or you can spill your guts to me and i'll do my best to give you good advice or at the very least give you a ""fuck that * insert person* for being such a * insert derogatory name.*"" ok that is all :)"

""why don't you feel good enough? i love you, why isn't that enough? i compliment you all the time. why don't you listen? does my opinion not matter enough?"" it's not that it's not enough. it's that i reject the way you see me because i'm not worth it *in my eyes.* it has nothing to do with what you feel about me, it's just the way i view myself because i've viewed myself negatively for so long, and can't change now. it's too much of a comfort to dislike myself. is that annoying to handle? probably. but, it doesn't change the fact that i can love someone with my whole heart and not feel an ounce of love for myself. can anyone else relate?"

ptsd,anxiety,1392,"it may be bizarre to say this but ... i cannot think, i cannot feel, i cannot do anything because i am too scared to do anything because i cannot trust anyone because i feel that i am living among a world of sharks, just like in the world of game of thrones. i am too scared of doing anything or even talking to anyone because i feel that everyone will come after me i feel that if i move one step, just one step, and everyone will come at me and eat me alive. i am too scared of doing anything and i feel very gloomy becuase this world, the entire world just fucking scares me. i know that there are probably good people out there and i applaud you for that but just like in the world of game of thrones, the good people always lose because is a messy, messy place that is filled and made up of lies and dirty work because somehow humanity is inherently evil, to this point"
depression,bipolar,1393,"don‚Äôt get me wrong , i‚Äôm very grateful that i can take care of myself , but i‚Äôm still depressed so i think i get at least some leeway to be pissed about this . what i hate is that when you‚Äôre high functioning you don‚Äôt have an illness to fall back on . it‚Äôs like when arthur fleck says ‚Äúthe worst part about having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don‚Äôt‚Äù . that‚Äôs extremely true in all cases but that‚Äôs how i feel right now as a high functioning . when you‚Äôre not high functioning people see that you‚Äôre not okay and the cut you some slack ing . i‚Äôve been depressed for the last four years , but i‚Äôm high functioning so is it really valid ? when you don‚Äôt feel like cleaning or doing your laundry you‚Äôre dirty . when you can‚Äôt bring yourself to pick up after yourself you‚Äôre dirty . and why‚Äôs that ? because nothing is wrong with you and there‚Äôs no reason for you to be doing this . they don‚Äôt understand depression and it shows . it‚Äôs just annoying when you have to be normal like everyone else even though you constantly struggle and nobody sees that . it‚Äôs like if it isn‚Äôt tangible it just isn‚Äôt true !"
depression,adhd,1404,"i‚Äôve been having the worst time of my life these past months and in return, i‚Äôve been late on assignments. my parents know that i‚Äôve been dealing with really bad depression and anxiety lately and i‚Äôve told them the reason why my assignments are overdue. it‚Äôs because i‚Äôm too mentally drained and unmotivated to do it. iÔ∏è can‚Äôt come up with anything to write because i‚Äôm too focused on how bad everything is. they never ask me how i‚Äôm doing, they ask me if iÔ∏ève gotten any homework done yet. and iÔ∏è just can‚Äôt take it anymore."
anxiety,ptsd,1405,feel free to message me anytime. i may not always be able to reapond right away but i always respond eventually and i never ghost away. i try my best to hold conversation woth anyone. i love you all.
ptsd,anxiety,1406,"i tend to internalize everything, i close up and shut down a lot. i don't really get angry at others, just with myself. it really helps for me to talk about it because it seems like i can get rid of some of the things that i've internalized."
adhd,bipolar,1408,"this cycle repeats itself until we/i get depressed--a low level but long lasting state of depression without swings, without strong emotions, a sort of vacant apathy. this isn't at all to say that its perpetual or hopeless, i'm just looking to open discussion about how to break this (without medication). for too many of us this pattern is sustainable. it leaves us drained and ashamed, but because of circumstance theres nothing that kicks us into gear. feel free to vent and support others, different perspective is good perspective!"
depression,bipolar,1410,"sorry if this has been asked before, but i was wondering if anyone knows or has experienced their intelligence deteriorating because of depression (or maybe meds)? i really used to be so smart and understood things easily and now i struggle so much academically and it makes me so frustrated and sometimes brings me to tears the fact that i feel so stupid and i feel like get stupider every year, i can't tell if it's because of my illness (i have chronic depression so i'll be taking meds my whole life) or what. any insight would be appreciated."
adhd,bipolar,1411,"while most people i know can barely muster a tired smirk, even the lamest ones keep me snorting forever. just saw someone here say ""copypasta"" and it had me rolling for minutes. and i'm actually in a horrible mood."
anxiety,adhd,1415,"i've been battling depression, anxiety for about 15 years. i've also struggled with adhd all my life. on top of that i'm in my mid 30s and never been in a relationship so my self esteem is cripplingly low. lately at work my anxiety has been getting worse. i'm convinced that the people i work with think i'm a creepy loser and constantly talk abal with my issues. i think i may need to move to a psychiatrist and take a more clinical approach. i'm supposed to see a doctor next week to see if she'll put me on depression and anxiety medication, but i really don't know what to expect. i'm so tired of my mind going nonstop all day. i just want to stop obsessing over what people think of me."
ptsd,anxiety,1423,"long story short, when i was in elementary school, i was bullied relentlessly by a kid much older than me. he used to do all kind of unpleasant shit to me, but what i hated the most was being sat on or held down and tickled until i cried. he was too strong and i was defenseless. i hated it and finally broke down and told my parents. tworld just falls down around me. now, tickling is a fairly common things between families and friends, and i'm living in constant fear of it happening. i know, it seems incredibly strange and i hate talking about it. it's so embarrassing because it seems so trivial to everyone else. i haven't even managed to say it to my therapist yet."
anxiety,ptsd,1424,"seriously. a minute ago, i was shoveling food into my mouth. i felt like i had a billion things to do at the moment, even though in reality i had a lot of time to do those things. i felt light headed and my heart was racing. in the moment i realized that there was no point in rushing and decided to take my time eating. as soon as i started to slow down, my anxiety instantly improved. i didn't feel 100%, but i felt more calm and less overwhelmed than before. it's weird how a simple thing like eating slowly can change things up. (forgive me if this is an obvious lpt. it's certainly not new because i've been told it countless times, but i've often overlooked it. hopefully this will help those of you who overlooked it as i have.)"
anxiety,adhd,1433,like i hate it for two reasons because first of all it either emasculating or infantilising. and second it implies that im not doing my best or at the least not trying or sometimes it comes off as someone making light of my feelings.
bipolar,none,1436,"[my last so i asked for some useful website ideas i could build for our community here and i got a few awesome replies that i‚Äôve taken under consideration. my main goal here is to build something that people (especially newcomers) will actually use. **i want it to be a place of happy, positive and organized information.** /u/fitsofthefather suggested building a section of medication and treatment related info that‚Äôs backed by research and studies. i want to hold off on that fidence boosting scripts that you can recite to yourself in times of need. it seems like a lot, but it‚Äôll fit into one website. my only question is would it benefit this community and do you see it being useful? if so, i will need a few people to consult regarding information for the website and if anyone wants a place to blog you‚Äôre welcome to blog here! everything will be anonymous unless you want otherwise. thanks everyone. edit: thanks so much to /u/tosher23 for the gold!"
adhd,anxiety,1447,thank you to this [wonderful who went waaaay out of their way to try and hurt my feelings but ended up turning a bad day into a good one because it reminded me that some people have it worse. there are people out there who only feel good when they make others feel bad and those are the people to feel truly sorry for. i'm so flattered that they saw me as a target :)
depression,none,1448,"my best friend visited my city last weekend. i found out from a facebook post about how great it was seeing all his friends. 'had a great weekend thanks to all my london friends, see everyone in a few months!' shit man. when i get married he'll be my best man, and he didn't even think to text when he spent a weekend in my city."
adhd,anxiety,1452,"they're both red, so they're totally the same thing, right? uuuuugh. and then i had to do the awkward ""oh no, actually i can't buy that, i'm so sorry"" thing and run away. so embarrassing. and even better, my car is in a parking garage and i'm going to have to call my boyfriend to come bring me money so that i can get it out. super awesome job today, self. sorry, just needed to vent. do neurotypical people really not do this shit all the time? because i feel like i do it way too often."
depression,adhd,1459,"well, today marks 24 years from the day i was born. and for as long as i can remember, it's still one shitty fucking birthday. last year was pretty shitty. i lost my best friend, my job, had not a dime to my name and was suicidally depressed. this year i'm on medication and i'm trying to be happier, to move on and to make a better man out of myself and to just try to be.... better. of course life wants to bitch slap me in the fucking face. so far since waking up i've found out that the police have recovered my wallet that was stolen a week ago. the wallet that had every shred of id in it. all the id was torn to pieces e i checked my bank account, they've taken out the monthly fees. there were other bank fees and yet another statement fee that they keep not reversing or taking off my account despite getting no statements. all in all? -$29. so i had about 68 cents to play with by the time it was all said and done. i mean is it too much to ask for a fucking break in my fucking life? for one fucking day where i can actually say that it's fucking mine and i can enjoy it or do i have to suffer through this fucking bullshit for the next goddamn century? if so i'll fucking finish it now. i am so fucking sick of this shit. fuck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bipolar,adhd,1460,"my kitchen counters are always full of crap. half unpacked bags of groceries, 12 packs, bread products, clean dishes i didn't finish putting away, receipts, cookies, chips, you get the picture. well today i got the motivation to clean it off. now, i didn't clean clean the kitchen. my stove still has food stuck to it, floors need to be swept, sink is dirty, but i put all clean dishes away and sorted most of the clutter. that's a supom after i do some more grading. i did some grading today. is it the higher remeron dose kicking in? is it the tms working? is it the fact that i started taking a multivitamin, vitamin d, and b12? do i really care what it is? here it is, the middle of the night, i took the max dose of atarax/vistaril, and i'm still awake. shit. i would clean but i'm dizzy from the sleep meds. this is reminding me of when i was diagnosed before meds."
ptsd,anxiety,1469,"i‚Äôm incredibly nervous but i‚Äôve decided to try some medical marijuana this week. maybe next if i chicken out. something has to change. i feel like i‚Äôve been doing whatever i can for the last two decades and plateaued with my health in the last four years or so. my medication, support system, physical activity level, and therapy are helpful but i still feel very frostrain is tailored to my issues and i trust my ‚Äúbud tender‚Äù but am terrified to lose control. but i think it could be the best type of exposure therapy for me. obviously my greatest fear is losing control but having a mild experience with some mj and facing it could be helpful. or it could be really, really bad. anyone relate to this or have tried anything similar ?"
depression,anxiety,1472,"don't you feel like wanting people to just get off your back and leave you alone, except that you don't really wanna be alone? don't you also feel so sad that you internalize everything but you still hope that someone... anyone will just read your mind and come by to give you what you want to hear, except you actually don't know what you want and you can't tell them because you already know what they'll say? and don't you also feel so... defeated but you hope that maybe eventually you'll find a reason, maybe a person, or at least a way to cure this feeling... but not really? yeah sorry guys i don't really have a place to vent, just wanted to share."
anxiety,bipolar,1475,"this should be a celebratory post but i've spent two days awake, shaking, throwing up or otherwise... i don't know if i can do it but i can't live the hell of staying in our 1 bedroom apartment any longer. i got hired at an oil and vinegar bar, and i really want to work there because i cook a lot and adore olive oil and i buy their products, but they want me to be a hard salesman, pull people in, explain a whole spiel about the chemistry and benefits of oil... and i'm dying inside tonight. the owner seems adamant about good training and told me not to spew bullshit if i didn't know it, cause you could be talking to a chemist and you might sound dumb, and i can't get that off my mind. except when i shopped there i dreaded when the employees bombed me with information. so yeah, i work at 2 tomorrow expecting to not last the 2 week probation period. everything i'm studying just gets lost in my head and i retreat back to my no window bedroom calm down. but i can't lose my car or stay in this house."
depression,anxiety,1485,"i was diagnosed with major depression and generalized anxiety when i was hospitalized over a year ago. since then i've been put on tons of medication. i hate the meds, i don't feel sad or anxious as much anymore, but now i just feel emotionless and apathetic. i don't even feel like myself anymore and i hate it, i feel like i've had my emotions and motivation taken from me. now all i wanna do is lay in bed."
