depression,bipolar,1,"i despise how when someone takes their life, people will say ""why didn't they just get help? why didn't they talk to me or someone else?"" because 99% of the time, the person who took their life did try and get help. but they had all their problems dismissed and invalidated. i can't stand how people these days are patting themselves on the back for spreading awareness about mental health. there is still so much farther to go. we have not made nearly enough progress for complacency."
depression,adhd,3,"if you care, will you read? my depression has gotten really bad over the last 2 years, and today i realized something. i don't have anyone. everyone i talk to, people i'd call 'friends' don't really care. they only notice me whd i want it all to just end. i don't know why i'm posting this, i don't know what i'm doing anymore. i don't know anything at all. and most of you are just going to look over this and leave. but if you care, will you talk to me?"

depression,bipolar,30,"here's to devin i didn't wake up yesterday until 6pm. i laid in bed until 9, woke up and bought a case of beer and 2 packs of cigarettes and started binge drinking. i took a shower for the first time in days. i wanted to be clean and drunk for what i planned to do. today is my 25th birthday. i didn't want to live this day. i planned to cut my arms up and bleed to death in the shower, but i wanted to play a few last rounds of rocket league to calm my nerves. then i got a message from a random player i was in a few matches with: ""wanna play in a party? playing with randoms isfted my spirits throughout the day today. i've told my family everything and will be seeking help in the form of therapy and a possible medication adjustment, if necessary. if you're out there reading this and you can't see the way back up, cling to me and we'll climb up together. again, thank you all so much for taking the time out of your day to wish me well and feel free to pm me anytime or to add me on psn: coonroast55 (it has to do with my last name and the fact that me and my friends used to put -roast on the end of everyone's last name for no reason whatsoever). &lt;3"

depression,bipolar,37,"""dont end your own life because you will hurt others"" shows one of the worst mindsets about mental illnesses people only think about themselves. your own pain doesnt matter, its just the pain for others, mentally healthy people they want to avoid. please dont confuse this with people who dont commit suicide because of other people - this is not what i am talking about. trying to push through by thinking about others is completely different than telling someone that their pain doesnt matter or matters less than the pain of others. imagine going to the doctor because of a broken leg and they tell you will too. we should talk about their pain, about their suffering, their fear. everyone is so quick to say ""oh yes mental illnesses are real ofc"" but when they are confronted with it they are ignorant. i dont think you can always keep going because of others. one day it will be too much. you need to put yourself first sometimes. the title might be misleading because you can say it - if its clear that this is not the only reason to not end your life and that your pain matters, but i cant write an essay in the title and i hardly ever heard someone say it without the worst judgement in their voice so..."

none,adhd,58,"what to do after c2? hi everyone! first things first. a bit of background: having been studying english for almost seven years, i passed cae in 2015 and subsequently passed cpe in 2018 (got a). after the proficiency exam, i managed to create some sort of language bubble around me. i have at least six hours of speaking practice weekly. i keep learning some new words and expressions. i read for at least an hour every day. i am an avid writer. i dabble with poetry and short stories (i post some on reddit and elsewhere). perhaps it may sound sacrilegious to some, but i don't really see c2 as some kind of pinnacle. i reached it a while ago. since then, i seem to have somewhat improved my writhed; it also feels like you've reached a plateau and now you're crawling rather than leapfrogging towards some new level. and that's fine. i'm going to retake this exam this year or maybe next year, just to keep my language alive and kicking. i put too much time and effort into it, and it would be too profligate of me to lay it all to waste. what do you think, folks? your opinions are welcome. nb. i am working as a chemical engineer. there's not much opportunity for me to apply my english at work, let alone at a level that high. i participate in and contribute to some local off-line speaking clubs, but, truth be told, they do not really challenge me. and i want something duly challenging."
bipolar,adhd,60,"just sharing my recent talk with my doctor monthly appointment with my doctor again. so i was a little worried about feeling this weird ""not caring"" on some things that i usually do. so i brought it up when he asked, is there anything yo bad? i replied, that's the issue, i don't know. i'm not sure if it is good or bad. i said maybe imm just tired of being stressed. he smiled and i was surprised when he said, then it's good that you are becoming resilient to daily stress."
none,adhd,70,"the truth about long term travel and your resume/career you see a lot of folk in here posing a question something along the lines of: ""if i take a year or two off to travel, how will this affect my future career?"" and many of the answers people offer up are absolute bs, mostly self-fulfilling drivel meant to rationalize their own life choices. so while many will disagree (this is the internet, after all), here is the actual truth about how long-term travel will affect your resume/career. **what will employers think when they see the gap in my resume?** they'll hate it. you may get lucky with that one in a hundred diamond in the rough but overall taking serious time off to travel is seen as a bad thing by any business in the pursuit of profit. can you spin your time overseas to look ""better"" in the eyes of an employer? absolutely. can you leverage the language skills, problem solving skills and social skills you picked up on your trip? absolutely. can you still get a job in your field when you get back? absolutely. but don't delude yourself into thinking any hiring managnd forgetting there's a different life out there. so many people seem to want it all...travel for months on end and still build their career. while a very minute percentage of people can pull off the double-whammy, most don't....so it's up to you to make a choice about what's more important to you: maximize career success or gather life experiences. for me i can't fathom a life that doesn't involve travel and adventure as the core goal....but there's no doubt that in terms of dollars and cents i am way, way behind pretty much every one of my friends in terms of earnings, retirement savings, etc. so yeah, it may be the right choice for you to throw all caution to the wind...but don't fall into the trap of actually believing it's ""good"" for your career because it's not. it is, however, good for your soul. it really depends on what's important to you...and that's not a judgment call where travel is right and career is wrong but to an extent you do need to make a proper choice and run with it. edit: i should have specified that this post is very geared towards north america."
anxiety,adhd,76,"depersonalization/dissociating? depersonalization/dissociating is the closest thing i've found to how i feel but not quite. i feel like i'm just floating through my days. like they fade into each other and i'm just trying to get through each one to make it idon't feel like i can relate to anyone either, so i don't bother going out of my way to communicate with anyone (say in a class setting) which just adds to the not-present feeling. what is this called, if anything? and what can i do about it? i'm so miserable"

none,ptsd,89,"[emergency help] canadian traveling to cape town and left my passport on plane hi i thought i would write here to get more info. i have tried going back to the airport and speaking with lost property as well as check in counter as well as the airline's phone number for lost property and they all said nothing was found. next step is to get a new passport. the canadian consulate is closed for a holiday in cape tffice with a small desk outside for his secretary. all our paperwork had to be scanned to the pretoria office, and it was them that made the decisions on how long it was going to take, etc. cpt's office didn't really do anything but scan it to them and email. their office was pretty useless. on top of it, pretoria's office hours were only 9am-12pm. i really hope this doesn't happen to anyone else in the future."

depression,bipolar,511,"a cop stopped me from killing myself last night a bit of background about me: male, turned 25 last week. i just feel like i have nothing and no one to live for. i‚Äôve been really struggling lately. the people i count on to come and talk to when i feel like shit just flat out don‚Äôt answer my texts, so i‚Äôve stopped bothering texting them. the only girl i‚Äôve ever been into shot me down and also never answers my messages either. so i stopped texting her as well. no one bothers checking on me so why should i reach out to them? my aunt died from brain cancer 3 years ago. and my older sister was killed by a drunk driver. i was seeing a therapist but stopped because i couldn‚Äôt afford it. they care more about money than the health of their clients. america summed up in one sentence i guess. i dropped out of engineering school in october after 6 years of college and multiple majors, 6 classes shy of graduating because i just didn‚Äôt wanna do it anymore. i was burned out and sick of busting my ass with nothing to show for it but exhaustion and stress. i may or may not go back. my student loans are due starting in june which i can‚Äôt afford. i have a car payment on top of it, paying for a car that i never wanted in the first place with money that i don‚Äôt have. i only bought it to shut my parents up about it, because my other one which i much prefer wouldn‚Äôt pass emissions for a completely bullshit reason but ran and drove perfectly all the same. i just absolutely fucking hate being told what i can and can‚Äôt do with my own damn car that i pay for 100% myself. my car is my therapist and my favorite thing that i own. i‚Äôm working a dead end job with no room for promotion or growth, and coronavirus got me laid off indefinitely til the whole mess dies down. i cannot possibly be expected to pay for all that shit when they know damn well millions of people are losing their fucking jobs. it‚Äôs been a month since quarantine and i can‚Äôt really even leave my house. can‚Äôt have a sociareminded me that he gave me his number. he walked back to the police cruiser and backed out, flashing his headlights at me to do the same. he followed me to the highway, turning off onto a side road and honking as he drove away while i got on the entrance ramp. i drove the 2 hours back home, not completely believing what had just happened and how he saved my life. i never even got his name or badge number. i got home close to 5 this morning and no one was up yet luckily. i snuck in and went to my room and slept for about 3 hours. i gave no indication to my family that i tried suicide the night before. no one knew that i went out last night. i still haven‚Äôt told them and i don‚Äôt plan to. they have no idea that i could‚Äôve died. i called the officer‚Äôs number and left him a voicemail thanking him again. he texted me later in the day saying his offer was still valid any time. i have no idea if he had to fill out any paperwork and don‚Äôt really want to ask. everyone has at least one secret that they‚Äôll take to their grave, and this is probably mine. it‚Äôs a long shot that he‚Äôll read this but if he does, i don‚Äôt know what to say to him or how to thank him. his compassion saved my life. it‚Äôs crazy to think what would‚Äôve happened if he had taken a different patrol route and hadn‚Äôt come along when he did. he deserves a promotion and to win the lottery. i owe him my life. cops get a bad rap for being arrogant, power hungry racists with itchy trigger fingers, but this particular officer represents what humanity should be like. we wouldn‚Äôt have people killing themselves if we simply stopped being assholes to each other. i don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs a department medal for talking a suicidal person off the ledge, literally in my case, but he deserves it. i could probably call his department number and get his name and send him something in the mail. not a bad idea. godspeed officer. i‚Äôll never forget this and how someone cared, and cared enough to actually do something about it."
adhd,bipolar,512,"""are you retarded?"" apologies for the use of that word in this post, for those who might be sensitive to it. *edit again* copy/pasting a comment to another user: where i'm from people use it as a slur toward the autism community. i'm actually not even sure it's just where i'm from - i see it all over the internet too. i don't personally think they're synonymous but since i witness ""autistic"" and ""retarded"" being used in the same sentence by shitty people all the time, i only wanted to be clear that i don't feel the same way and that i don't want to hurt anyone with my post :( that's why i had previously written that i don't use that word, nor would i ever call somngelist. but when i argue with my boyfriend i can barely remember what i've just said...i can't always remember how the argument even started. i get really flustered and then that gets worse. all i seem to hear is ""you're wrong."" i'm not always good at getting across what i mean the first time, either. so in frustration last night, my boyfriend asked me ""are you retarded?"" and it honestly hurt me a bit. i know some of you have had people ask you that. you start giving the question some thought because you feel you can't do anything right, ever. i'm not sure why i'm making this post...just feeling down in general. fucks with me every time, when someone asks me that."
