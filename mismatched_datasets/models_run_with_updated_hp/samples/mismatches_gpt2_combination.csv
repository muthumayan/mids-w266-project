ptsd,bipolar,4,"i cry whenever we raise our voice at our daughter we have a three year old who is, well, 3. she’s getting very difficult and we need to be firm and not let her run wild. problem: when my husband raises his voice at my daughter (mind you, this isn’t screaming. it’s not (annoyed while driving, or if we bicker) this starts happening. i start dbt group tomorrow. i’ve never tried it. i hope i can find skills to deal with this. i had this under control for a very long time and then had it triggered in february. it just keeps getting worse."
ptsd,depression,7,"after a bit of scrolling... i’m crying because reading some of these posts really make me feel validated and like i’m not alone. this week has been god awful, but finding this sub and being able to relate / not feel so alone is really helpful and i’m really happy that this community exists."
depression,bipolar,8,"i've called five different therapists now and none of them are accepting new patients dude, what the actual fuck. fuck all this ""therapy will help"" bullshit. all my paste people to make money talking/ taking advantage of mentally ill people. fuck it all. this is all just a massive waste of my fucking time. i'm so fucking tired of living."
bipolar,depression,15,"finally put a couple good days together - this sub has really helped i just want to thank all the great people out there i have “met” the past few days. i felt such a sense of lonelinessing of good days continues. i hope the rest of you out there are putting some good days together as well, and if you are not, know you have a friend who is ready to listen. thanks again!"
none,bipolar,18,"you can help my mother. my mother has had joint pain for quite sometime, and now it has escalated to a very different level where she can't even walk and she has been on the bed for past 6 months. i'm from a small towm called jamshedpur/ tatanagar and we have gone to almost every doctor and tried all their methods but no improvement has shown, infact by taking soo many h who can really help her unlike the doctor's in my city.. so what places/hospital/finance schemes are my option? if the treatment to it is high we cannot afford it.... what to do guys. i'm really desperate and really i cannot see my mother suffer every minute of everyday... i tried to say this as openly as possible but i know i don't know the best words to describe it...."
anxiety,depression,29,"guys... i just did two things i never thought i'd do in a hundred years. i signed up for stuff. in 9 days i will be going to madison to see my favorite musician play live after being a big fan since i was like 13 (i'm 21 now). i'm goir anything like this. i always stop if i can't find anyone to do it with me. but i figure if i live life like that, i'll never get to do anything i want to do ever. i'm excited, i'm nervous... but it's almost like a *good* nervousness."
adhd,bipolar,31,"only you would appreciate this nobody else in my life would understand this but i know you guys would. all my life i have been shit at school and academic learning. i've been medicated for almost two years now. i heard today that my assignment for a professional qualification scored 80%, one of the highest marks given. i could never have done that prior to treatment. i am so god damn proud of myself."
adhd,bipolar,39,"can i give you all one big cyber hug?? fairly new to this subreddit (been browsing it for about a week) and i'd just like to say that i absolutely love tternet family because these are the types of interactions/friendships i crave irl. but for now, have this cyber hug of appreciated, you guys are the best."
ptsd,bipolar,40,"i posted about my first emdr experience fairly recently. now, before i've even had my second treatment, my therapist told me she is leaving the office for a non profit... i'm feeling...abandoned i guess. i know it's irrational. career changes happen and it's grwho weren't vets. i also felt like when she was telling me, that she didn't really care that i was going to have to switch therapists. she tried to sound like she cared but i know better. she's probably relieved she doesn't have to listen to my problems anymore."
depression,bipolar,43,"49 y.o. virgin here, bday in a month, severely depressed, ask me anything hi, this is a throwaway for obvious reasons. i want to thank this comunity for support during worst days. i have been depressed for a long time. in a month i am going to be a 50 yo failure, a ghost, etc. i am living completely alone with my cat. all my relatives are dead or cut off contacts with me a long time ago. i make a decent living and have travelled a lot. why am i virgin? good question. i am obviously noblow up to these proportions. thank you guys for kind words and support. i will try to answer as many answerds as possible. edit2. by the way, i am not hopeless or bitter. just very depressed, that's why this ended up in this sub. i see a lot of threads by young 20-25 y.o. virgins, so i decided to share my story, i thought that may be helpful in some way. edit3. omg i did not expect the post about me being an old vrigin to be my most upvoted and popular, especially on throaway account."
ptsd,depression,57,"i cried several times today cw: suicide, violence, law enforcement, child abuse... i cried on my way to work after i bought my coffee. i saw the sunrise and started crying because i thought about the people i couldn't save because i wasn't good enough, they won't get to live and see a sunrise. or enjoy a coffee in the morning. that hurt (i worked with certain organizations i can't name for obvious reasons tracking human traffickers for some context. anyone in law enforcement, or first responders probably know you can't sdrunk last night too. i cried at home because i just needed to. i think i just needed a day but i had meetings. ive been feeling so helpless that i can't even bother to feed myself, ive lost so much weight. i think i want to die but i have friends that have committed suicide too. and i don't want to put my friends through the pain i felt. today was a bad day and i wanted to bitch about it, welcome to my shit show ladies and gentlemen. i'm weak now, i don't have any more mental fortitude left. i hope your day was better :)"
ptsd,anxiety,58,"dae have really bad disassociation after panic attacks. once i come down from flashbacks or panic attacks, i get really bad disassociation. sometimes lasting for days. does anyone else go through this. any tips on how to stop it. i tried grounding but im so far gone it doesn't help."
depression,bipolar,59,"i just attempted suicide latest update; if the majority wants me to go into detail in everything of my experience from that night on, the other side and such. id be happy to, i need motivation and comfort to do so. well ive never been on this website. i just googled my thoughts thorough and sorta winded up here. 29 hours ago i ate 30 tablets which of brand i will not state due to security, i drank 10liters of beer, one bowl of hash and said bye. i met my childhood friend, he said i was more than welcome, he missed me, we'd have fun. i instantly thought i was trippin on some sort of marked dope. my long lost friend told me about times i forgot by far, in details, things that i miss. i felt like i was hanging out with him for weeks, when suddenly i saw an old woman which i clearly knew (not going further into details but she is well known by our family as a psychic). she told me to say loudly if i was happy at the moment, which i did. we sat and spokis not my first language, i just see patterns in my head to how it should sound due to my autism. lets start again, i've already fallen back twice. adrenaline popped somewhere in my shoulder to get me back last time, not due to the fact id wanna die. but i've gotten severe damage from the attempt which the doctor said would make life ""different"" for now im doing okay, im tired. really really tired. i feel empty and for the moment completely alone. doc put on donnie darko today, i watched the whole thing thinking about depression and family for some reason. i've seen it a gazillion times but that's the first step to ""different"" i guess, im not familiar with the feelings i got at the moment and im gonna keep posting daily (as far as my body and mind lets me). for the moment i can barely do it, fyi i would never even start typing on here today if it wasn't for all the support and heroism in mankind. you are all my glowing angels, thank you. -xx dxty 3m"
anxiety,bipolar,63,"motivational speakers: do they upset anyone else? i just saw a motivational speech tonight. the speech was fine, good advice, well written. but i left it feeling so hopeless and almost in tears. here's this guy who's wealthy, driven, positive, and fit previous ones. i feel like a fucking negative nancy and that by not fixing that *right now,* i'm sabotaging my own life. i don't feel motivated right now. i sort of want to curl up into a ball. does anyone else react this way to motivational speeches?"
ptsd,bipolar,83,no one will give me my meds i've seen three different doctors and none of them will give me my meds. i'm literally getting to the point i will just buy the pills off the internet and risk going to prison just to function. they keep trying to tell me there are other meds that help that aren't addictive. why do they keep telling me this fucking lie and why the fuck do they believe it!!! i guess i'll just drink to function because that's what these people fucking want. i want to strangle these fucking doctors.
adhd,bipolar,86,"do any of you ever fear people might think you are a liar because you can't remember details of anything, even things you actively enjoy? i often have people bring up songs/albums/bands or movies/tv shows during conversation. they might say, ""have youd it. i fear it makes me appear as a compulsive liar who says they like things just to fit in when in reality i just cannot remember many details, lines, names or lyrics, just i enjoyed said movie/show/album etc. anyone else get this? feelsbadman.jpeg."
depression,adhd,88,"i always type out comments on how relate to someone and their situation, only to delete them and keep it to myself. i don't know if it's because i feel they won't care, like i'm being annoying, or if i realize i simply don't want to share. i just know i do it."
anxiety,adhd,89,"yesterday i rented a car i had the day off and it was only 30 dollars a day (minus fuel). i drove around all day looking for tough places to parallel park. i switched lanes, i hit the gas, parallel parked some more, tried different things,  resolve as this one. all you need is some quality time with the vehicle. edit: i also got completely ass backwards lost and found my way back again via signs alone and even asked some stranger for directions. point is it's a great exercise."
bipolar,adhd,90,"i can really use some encouragement right now. my doctor recently decided that she thought i was stable enough to start treating my adhd on top of my bp1. she warned me that the medicine could cause me to have a bad reaction and potentially lead to another psychotic episode or something. she started me on a low dose of vyvance but i didn't feel like it was doing anything and i've gradually gone up to the maximum dose. i've been pretty messed up for about a week now though. i also have pretty bad social anxiety and i think the meds are making me manic or mixed manic. i've been very disconnected from other people., paranoid and socially withdrawn. i havnt left my appr but i'm afraid because i don't want to get admitted again. she's a new doctor and i don't know how she is about this sort of thing. my last dr seemed like he wanted to try and have me admitted ""for observation"" all the time, even when he wanted to try me on new medicine. that's bullshit though because hospitals are safe places where they remove the stress of the outside world. how can they observe if a medicine is working or not if there aren't any factors at play that would cause an episode. i don't know what to do. i won't go in for an unscheduled appointment. the last time i went to an unscheduled appointment for issues i ended up being admitted against my will"
ptsd,anxiety,94,a strange and perhaps interesting question does anyone feel emotionally immature after/during an unmanageable anxiety attack or panic attack? i was diagnosed with ptsd when i was 7-8 years o else experiences this or if it's just me. i keep meaning to talk to my therapist about it but i keep forgetting. i'm mature in other ways but emotionally i feel like it's that of a teenager.
bipolar,depression,100,"so sick of the revolving door of therapists [rant] i'm on my fourth new therapist this year. y'know it takes a while to warm up to them and be comfortable trusting them. i was just getting to the point of really liking the one i was seeing and they just called to tell me she's leaving. i know therapists are people and life happens to them and shit but argh. now i'm back to square one of having to feel out this new person and explain all my shit to them and get them to the point of having *me* figured out. it feels like a waste of my goddamn time...i've told my story to so many people and just when they get to the point of actually helping me i get stuck back at sque relationship so we need to figure out who else you can have as a support."" bitch please, we've been in a long term relationship longer than you've had your counseling license i'd wager...just because we aren't married doesn't mean it's ""unstable."" i went home and mailed my old therapist and said, ""hey i'm sorry to hear you're going i hope everything works out ok, if you're still practicing in the area please let me know where and i'll go with you"" and she wrote me back and said basically ""thanks for being my patient, i'll still be practicing and i'll be in touch soon."" so....hopefully i can go back to her because this new girl just made me want to punch something."

adhd,anxiety,104,"people sceptical of my diagnosis because i'm ""successful"" apologies for long post / first post awkwardness. i was diagnosed about a month ago after going to several doctors about my struggles. the first doctor dismissed me because ""i didn't fail in school"". the second said i was just distracted by my own anxiety. finally went to a psychiatrist who clocked add right away, paired with generalised anxiety disorder. the reactions of friends and family have been sceptical at best, and their main comment is ""but you've always done so well."" yes, from the outside i'm not a failure: * passed school * got a four year degree * got a job and got promoted * now self employed as a consultant the truth is, even though i was so desperate for a d **does everyone get an identity crisis when they get diagnosed?** do you find you have to retell your life story to people - with the ugly parts you never shared before - so that they get it? i also feel a little cheated because i'm 28 and have spent a lot of my adult life reading self-help books, trying to accept and love myself as i am. only to discover that things i've fought so hard to love about myself (like being overweight) are a legit by-product of messed up chemistry in my brain (i'm now losing weight effortlessly since starting concerta, because i'm not impulsively eating &amp; obsessing about food.) **tl;dr recently diagnosed, people don't believe me because i've never let myself fail in public. anyone else like this?**"
anxiety,ptsd,107,"i asked to change the tv at the doctors i was sitting at the doctors waiting for my husband to finish when the 700 club came on the tv talking about how jesus healed mental and physical disabilities. i thouging to fake news. so i changed it to local news. so now listening to a million commercials, but none of them claiming i can be cured by allowing jesus into my heart. but i did it!! i'm really proud of myself."
bipolar,depression,112,"anyone in boston want to meet up? just feeling lonely lately, and haven't had any friends with this shared experience. i'm in my early twenties but am totally cool with friends from all walks of life. let's get dinner or drinks!"
bipolar,anxiety,113,keep getting impulsive rapid thoughts when i'm alone. (nsfw) i've been struggling to rationalize myself right now. i have thoughts to hurt or kill myself. or walk for hundreds of milpass. i don't want to fail.fail.fail.fail.fail. i don't know how to control this my speech is being affected by this either too fast or slow and slurred. this anxiety has to stop now.
ptsd,bipolar,114,"lashing out at people you love because you can't tell them what happened? is it common? too much horrible shit has happened to me in the past few weeks. one of the things i can't tell my parents. i have been going around house to house staying with other people because i want to avoid my parents. due to my other mental health issues, i still live at home at age 2my psychiatrist is being a bitch to me. didn't care that i couldn't sleep. i had to go to the e.r. (i have medicaid) to get sleeping pills that actually work because she wouldn't return my call after giving my trazedone, which doesn't even work. i'm so angry at everyone. even my therapist who i told my problem to, i don't think he takes me seriously. i'm so tired."
ptsd,anxiety,115,"something feels wrong. like it says, something feels wrong. i can taste in my mouth that something isn't right. it's as if i'm looking at everything through a different light, like my ms being screamed throughout my head. i can feel in my chest that something is wrong, it's not anxiety, it's my heart pumping so loud. it feels like something very bad is about to happen."
anxiety,depression,119,"i did it guys!! i made the call to a place to finally seek some help. i was honest with the lady on the phone and it felt good knowing that i (we!!!) are not alone in this!! i know i will not always feel like this and i hang on to that thought and for now, that's what is getting me through this tough time. may all who read this know that this too shall pass and if anyone needs someone to talk to, i am here to listen."
anxiety,bipolar,124,"does anyone else talk to themselves, sometimes negatively? i consistently talk to myself. sometimes i will sit down, and have conversations with myself. it's like a back and forth q&amp;a; as my mie names too. like ""idiot"", ""stupid"", or ""loser"". in all honesty, i feel like i only call myself these names to motivate myself to do better next time. however, i'm not sure how helpful it really is."

anxiety,bipolar,142,"i'm 25 and i'm tired. tired of knowing who i am, but not what i want to be. tired of society deciding where i should be at in life and what i should be doing. tired of feeling like all i've done is waste my time not knowing what to do. tired of being told to make a difference in the world. tireat. tired of looking at others achievements and feeling perpetually inferior. tired of feeling like i'm in some race that i'm losing. tired of self doubt. tired of this never-ending cycle. i'm exhausted and i don't know what to do about it. does anyone else feel this way? if so, what did you do?"

ptsd,anxiety,150,just stopped myself from going into a full blown panic attack and he didn’t even notice. i was sitting at the kitchen table and my husband was standing over me trying to give me a high-five… he thrust his hand out so quickly at me i got triggered and started to tear up and breathe very heavily. now normalx years and he didn’t even notice... i asked him just now how he felt about me not spiraling into a panic attack and being able to come myself down this tim all he said was “ that was nice.” i needed to share with you guys because i have no one else in this world. for a moment i was really proud of myself.

bipolar,anxiety,155,"cried for the 1st time in over 5 years title says it all. i was bombarded this morning by my boss, essentially belittling me in front of the entire office. i sucked up like the man i am, and sat down belmost forgot how that felt. i ran to the back half of the office, stood out in secluded section of the warehouse and wept. granted it was for only about 30 seconds, i haven't felt such relief in so long."
ptsd,anxiety,171,i use cheap bluetooth led lights to help regulate sleep. it is amazing. i bought a couple of bluetooth led lights from homedepot for around $15 each. through their app i setup 'schedules' that t is almost off. i still have plenty of nights of insomnia but it has helped me create a better routine and it helps so much that it happens automatically. anyone else tried something like this?
bipolar,adhd,173,"does anyone else have the most awful time choosing words wisely during conversation? i feel like every time i have a conversation or try to, i’ll have em in the first half, but by the second i imagine the -2 social points from sims. it’s not just imaginary. after i get that feeling, ugh i feel people glaring at me and my gut is telling me to stop and continuing on until i’ve ruined the atmosphere. telling a joke that is insensitive/being annoying/rambling/etc it feels awful because it does numbers on my reputation. it gets in the way of dating and making friends."

anxiety,adhd,181,"lpt: slow the fuck down. seriously. a minute ago, i was shoveling food into my mouth. i felt like i had a billion things to do at the moment, even though in reality i had a lot of time to do those things. i felt light headed andwly can change things up. (forgive me if this is an obvious lpt. it's certainly not new because i've been told it countless times, but i've often overlooked it. hopefully this will help those of you who overlooked it as i have.)"
bipolar,adhd,183,"forgetting how to speak correctly, or at all. i'm just curious to see if this happens to anyone else; the title is pretty self explanatory. (tl;dr at bottom) i don't mean like i'm ""out of it"" or even just fatigued for the day and my brain loses its train of thought one too many times. i feel like that happens to everyone at least once in a while (including myself). i mean like it takes an insane amount of mental energy for me to say a sentence from start to finish correctly, usually takes me a few tries to do so. so to say to speak, or how to speak in general. anyone else have similar experiences? tl;dr: does anyone sometimes find their speech to be very impaired, like you feel as if you forgot how to speak at all? maybe due to an episode, personal issues, both, etc? edit: thank you so much everyone who replied to this post, sharing your experiences and such. one of my biggest insecurities is my speech (due to the issue mentioned in this post) and it's so comforting to have so much nice, supportive feedback and to know i'm not alone on this :)"
adhd,bipolar,187,"i finally swallowed my pride and went back on add medication, first pill today. holy shit i should have done this ages ago. for anyone suffering and on the fence about it, give it even more serious thought. also this might be a bit of an overreaction seeing as its just the first fucking day but if this is how things are normally going to be then yeah; i should have done this ages ago. when i went on academic probation after my first year of college my mother told me that i should consider going back on it and would pay for it. i declined; citing that i did not want to be on the medication for my whole life and that i didn't want my success to be thanks to a pill. prideful. i did not want to be seen as ""weak"" needing medication just to focus on things that people did so easily. fast forward almost two years. i got my associates at a community college, but barely. my gpa was just a hair below 2.5, preventing me from transferring. i did land a job that paid well and i enjoyed. i had it for a year before hitting 3 strikes and being let go. 1st strike was because i went to fast and didn't double check something. 2nd strike was honestly just me not clocking in during the window before shift started. several of these tardies were over because i would get carried away talking to my co-workers about what needed to be done before shift (i had an odd job and this was required. i showed up 10-15 minutes early each shift). i would clock in after the buzzer rang, reminding me. 3rd strike was because of repeated er. on the other, i'm feeling *liberated*. like the world is open to me now. literally every teacher i've had has mentioned that i should be doing a lot better than i am right now. every employer has praised my skills and work ethic but bemoaned on how i might solve problems other can't, but stumble on the simple things we do every day. today is a turning point. things will not be the same. the world had better watch out, because i don't think its prepared for /u/replieswithanimegif on medication. thank you to /r/adhd, and your wiki in particular. reading through the wiki was an eye opening experience that convinced me that i wasn't weak/broken/whatever. i had an issue. there was a solution. i realized that i was what i criticized often; someone refusing to acknowledge the answer when its staring right in front of them. thank you for helping me confront my pride and shove the answer in their face. tl;dr /r/adhd wiki is amazing. after two years of getting very little done academically and losing my job over add issues i've finally swallowed what to me was a bitter pill. if today is any indication, this is the beginning of major beneficial change. for the first time in a long time, i'm going to go to sleep without the thought of all the things i didn't get done tormenting me and making me feel inadequate. at least if adderall doesn't fuck up my sleep too much since i took it at like 1pm. thankfully my old job had me up till 12am anyways and i often don't get to sleep until 2 or 3am. here goes nothing."

anxiety,adhd,257,"my personal tips for anxiety (long post) i haven't beat my anxiety, and i don't think that is ever possible. it's important to understand that anxiety is natural, and everyone experiences it; anxiety is a human emotion and it is natural to feel it. for some of us, it can be detrimental to our life however. i apologize if there are any grammatical or spelling errors. tl;dr: eat varied vegetables, exercise everyday, meditate, detach yourself from mental clutter, be aware of your drug intake, pay attention to the moment, engage in flow, seek anxiety and confront it. **nutrition** you are what you eat. if you are neglecting your diet you are neglecting your mind. personally, i have had a lot of success by implementing certain foods and being aware of the effect that these foods have on my body. tl;dr: eat vegetables, supplement magnesium ,abstain from caffeine or supplement l-theanine, learn about your gut microbiome, consume less sugar and eat more vegetables, consume sufficient fats. * magnesium: magnesium relaxes the body and helps contribute to a healthy electrolyte balance. personally, i noticed a severe reduction in my tremors and baseline anxiety level once i started to supplement magnesium glycinate. * caffeine: this appears to be obvious, but i feel like a lot of people do not think about this. excessive caffeine levels increase the amount of mental noise i have, which results in higher levels of anxiety. * l-theanine: a natural amino acid that is found in green tea. if you do choose to consume caffeine, combine 200mg theanine with your caffeine dosage to help combat any anxiety. also works splendidly as a study aid. * gut microbiome: i am not going to pretend to thoroughly understand this complicated system. but, from my understanding we have a second ""brain"" in our stomach. the bacteria that we choose to feed within our stomach has a feedback system, which fuels certain cravings and can change our mental state. this is why your anxiety may peak after a round of anti-biotics, you have eliminated all the bacteria in your stomach, and if you eat a diet rich in sugars or simple carbs you will have fed the bad bacteria. if your gut is populated by these bad bacteria, it will have repercussions on your mental health. * microbiome practical advice: consume more fiber and vegetables to feed good bacteria. consume more probiotics rich foods such as kimchi, kefir, saurkraut, and kombucha. favoid simple carbohydrates such as sugars, white bread, etc. avoid alcohol. consider supplementing a probiotics, examine.com is a fantastic resource to find the right supplement for you. **t seperately. * you are not your thoughts: your thoughts are not completely true and are built upon heuristics. just because you believe that your coworkers are talking about you, this does not make it true. our brains are incredible, but they are oftentimes inaccurate. * mindfulness: again, the goal is to dwell less in our brains, and focus more on the present moment. there is no past or future, the only thing that truly exists is the present moment. when your anxiety is peaking, take time to focus on the sensation of your breath, rub your fingers together and be aware of the feeling, do anything that grounds you with your physical sensation. * watch your brain: take the time every day to just let your brain think. don't try to control your thoughts or empty your brain, just wait and see what your next thought will be. if it is negative, don't reject the thought. follow the thought as far as your mind wants to, and move on when you notice another thought arise. again, this creates a barrier between you and your mind. * flow: have you ever played a game where you are completely in the moment? maybe the ball was just thrown to you, and your body seems to react automatically. this is flow, and it is a important part of our mental well-being. you can achieve this state through many different activities, take the time to find the ones that you can find flow in. **the importance of fear**: courage isn't the absence of fear, but the ability to recognize your fear and act anyway. by engaging in activities that give you anxiety, you will find that your anxiety is often times unfounded. this sounds difficult, but honestly the best thing you can do with your anxiety is to push yourself. take baby steps, don't jump into the deep end. you will be controlled by your anxiety if you don't push the levels a bit. if you have social anxiety, start talking more online. make small talk with the cashier. find whatever baby steps work for you. **therapy**: you are not weak if you consult a therapist. please, if you are really struggling go and try to talk to some different therapists. they are generally wonderful people who just want you to live a happy, fulfilled life. **recommended reading:** siddhartha by herman hesse meditations by marcus aurelius the power of now by eckhart tolle the subtle art of not giving a fuck by mark manson the slight edge by jeff olson the feeling good handbook by david burns. these are some of the things that have helped me, hopefully you find something that can help you as well. if you have any suggestions or something that you would like to comment on, please do."

bipolar,none,288,"dbt day one - radical acceptance and healthy distraction dialectical behavior therapy aims to balance accepting things as they are with aiming for positive change. the main disciples in dbt are mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, emotional regulation, and distress tolerance. each day (if i can keep this up) we will discuss an exercise from one of these topics. the first and most basic distress tolerance skill in my book is distraction. distraction gives you time to create an appropriate response to pain or impulse by temporarily stoping you from thinking about the pain or impulse. distraction is different from avoidance because you still intend to deal with the situation in the future, when you are more ready. sometimes for me if i can distract myself from emotional pain the pain passes on it's own with no further action necessary. an example would be when i get woi'm hardly eating and i've already exercised a lot today). browsing redding will distract me from an impulse. here is a hypothetical example (it's not relevant now, but it will be later). i am bipolar and i am depressed. i want to kill myself now, but i will probably feel better in the morning. i will call my uncle and talk on the phone to distract myself from the pain. if he doesn't pick up, i will pet my dog. it is ok to cry. feel free to type out more than one example. it might be a good idea to do one for feeling up and one for feeling down. this post was guided by the dialectical behavior therapy skills workbook by mckay, wood, and brantley, but it is original content. if you share credit ssnakeggirl and the dialectical behavior therapy skills workbook or you're plagiarizing big time. the book is $11 new and $4 used, so if you want your own copy it's very accessible."

adhd,anxiety,676,"i cleaned my room and holy shit! sorry, this is long. so, just like the title says, i cleaned my room yesterday. i mean, i really cleaned it. it was disorganized and always messy and it had been driving me nuts for probably a year. i made a deal with my husband that every saturday we would choose one area of the house and purge it and really scrub it. we've lived in our house for 6years and we neaten it here and there, clean it up better when company comes, but we've never really gone room by room and sorted everything and purged all the old stuff and scrubbed the corners and walls and stuff. so this is pretty embarrassing, but i normally use natural cleaners for everything except the toilet and i've never really scrubbed everything hard- just surface cleaning here and there to get it a step above unsanitary and gross. yesterday i broke out the big guns and used an entire brand new can of scrubbing bubbles just on my makeup counter and toilet/shower area (our house was built in the 70's and our sink is in our bedroom opposite another counter vanity for make up, and the toilet and shower are in a tiny little room with a pocket door). you guys, i dusted everything, scrubbed the window frames, washed the windows, cleaned our lampshades inside and out including the bulbs. i scrubbed all the baseboards, washed and reorganized my medicine cabinet shelves e're each tackling their bedrooms. little by little we're going to make our way through the whole house and de-clutter and organize it. it's such a daunting task, but just knowing how good it feels to get it done is huge motivation! i'm also trying to not berate myself for letting it get so bad. cleaning is probably my least favorite activity ever, but i feel so good when things are picked up and cleaned. i know it's better for my mental health and feeling in control, too. more motivation to get rid of a lot of extra crap taking up room in my life! tl;dr-cleaned my room and it was much worse than i'd realized. motivated to keep the momentum going and get the rest of the house in order. edit:: i thought i should give an update! it has been three weeks and my room is still clean! i can't even believe it, but it is!!! dh and i both also clean all three of our kids rooms and i cleared up a lot of launfry today. i can't even begin to tell you how motivating it is to get this done. i think i've reached a point where i actually want to clean things up because of how nice it feels! we still have some pretty major sections of the house to work our way through and it will be a chore to get the kids to be more cognizant of their rooms, but after three saturdays of committing to this it feels like i'm almost at the stage of making it a new normal! *happy dance!*"

depression,bipolar,805,"if you feel shitty, help someone else not feel shitty. kinda shitty advice. but i'll start with some backstory. i'm on mobile so forgive me. (this will be kinda rambly) i was diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety disorder after i checked into a psychiatric hospital a few years back, but i always felt as i grew up that something was wrong. when i went to go meet my biological mother (who is very bipolar) when i was 18 things started to click with me that i needed to figure out a way to find meaning. it didn't help that my step-mom was an abusive cunt. so overall i kinda suck at being a person.(still do) anyways, i've struggled with constantly feeling down, and also feeling a whole lotta shit i didn't really understand. because of this i turned to weed and alcohol when i was 15. went through a few phases of drinking hard, but really weed was my poison of choice(still dont think it's bad but that's for another sub). again anyways because of the plant i kinda regained a sense of what it meant to be a healthy funcnt know how we'll pay the rent, things get complicated with family, with work, with life. and all of it together makes me wanna opt out. but then i think of leaving him by himself to deal with it himself and what a living hell that would be. even if i cant do much, ill do what i can till i can't. because if i dont that would make me sadder than anything i can ever encounter in my life. my point is that out there there are strong, amazing, incredibly intelligent and driven people, who do this shit alone. while feeling everything. and its heart breaking. my dad spent his life trying to make me feel welcome when every fiber of my being says i don't belong on this earth. the least i can do is gtfo bed and try to do something. even if my battle that day is just to brush my teeth. so that he can see a good looking smile that he made. to make him feel just a little better. that's my part, my mission. thats what gets me up. there are people that can use your help, and you owe it to them. but that s just my opinion."

adhd,anxiety,1104,"what learned helplessness is like just in case anyone isn't aware of what learned helplessness feels like, and as a warning to people not to keep trying the same thing over and over, i've written the following. i will use the term ""brain"" to refer to the unconscious, impulsive parts of the brain, the parts that aren't ""you"", and ""you"" to refer to your conscious experience and rational brain. (disclaimer, this is only my experience, i don't know what other people's experiences are.) --- imagine walking around, going through life, except you don't decide what you do. your brain decides everything for you and you have no say. it wants to play video games, so you play video games. that isn't to say you don't fight it, but on those occasions that you do you either are simply unable to do anything, or every frustration with yourself for every past failure floods upon you, washing your willpower away in a tidal wave of anxiety. you quickly learn the only way to fight is to not fight at all. --- now, imagine somebody calmly tells you, ""i know it's hard, but you really need to just get up and do it. i have no magic bullet unfortunately."" this is nice, they know that you have a hard time ""just doing it"" but at this point there's no way around it, it just needs to be done. you wholeheartedly agree with them, and feel like the ultimate solution _is_ to ""just do it"". your brain however immediately reminds you how ""it's never worked before, so why will it work now?"" this isn't just a small voice, it is backed by the combined anxiety of every failure and inadequacy you have ever had. --- i'll attempt to explain what lies behind this sense of hopelessness: this sense of hopelessness, in its simplest form, is the feeling that ""it's never worked, so why would it change?"" however, it goes deeper than that. the following is the main thought process: - according to other people you just need to try hard enough to solve the problem - you feel ""i just don't care anymore"" ( ditto ) - ""i hate myself"" (when i metaphorically close my eyes, cover my ears, and run from what i need to do yelling ""lalalalalalalala"", also when i am sitting doing something i enjoy and remember what i'm supposed to be doing) - ""i just can't."" (when i try to calm myself or when i'm lying in a fetal position on the bed, spiraling deeper into depression) - ""i just want the world to go away"" (this feeling makes me realize why some people kill themselves. i fortunately just retreat to my bed or some form of entertainment that allows my brain to shut off temporarily) --- i'm not saying this is permanent problem, or that there aren't any solutions, just that it's incredibly difficult, more difficult than i feel most anyone can imagine. it's the torture of hopelessness, with the frustration of fully knowing with your rational brain that hope itself is all that is needed to solve the problem, yet finding that hope hopelessly far away. please, everyone. think before you tell someone to ""just try."" they may have forgotten how to. --- edit: some people may say that you just need to build in systems, and i agree that that is a good solution, but at least for me, i've tried so many of my own systems that even trying to talk with it causes my brain to lock up with anxiety. likely because it forces me to confront all my past failures, which further discourages me from trying. i'd still love to hear any advice people have though. --- tl;dr; learned helplessness isn't thinking you are helpless, it is feeling that you've forgotten how to try. if you really wanted to try it would have worked, since people say to just try, so you must not really _want_ to try, so you begin to instead want to want to try. in addition, confronting it in any way brings with it all the anxiety of every past failure, meaning that often, instead of doing something you often fail to do you just close your eyes and hope it'll go away."
