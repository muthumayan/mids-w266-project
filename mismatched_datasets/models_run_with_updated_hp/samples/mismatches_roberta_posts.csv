bipolar,anxiety,0,"lately i've been having this issue with how time passes. i don't seem to feel it pass. like it's ten thirty pm for me right now, and i don't feel like a day has passed. i haven't been doing anything absorbing wween setting it and the alarm. it's kind of a problem. i don't seem to realize that i'm wasting as much as i am because time doesn't register at all. has anyone else experienced this? is there anything i can do?"
anxiety,ptsd,2,"i was sitting at the doctors waiting for my husband to finish when the 700 club came on the tv talking about how jesus healed mental and physical disabilities. i thought about just going to the cnews. so i changed it to local news. so now listening to a million commercials, but none of them claiming i can be cured by allowing jesus into my heart. but i did it!! i'm really proud of myself."
ptsd,depression,3,"i'm 26 now and 8 months ago my (first ever) girlfriend of a year killed herself, i was the first to find her. i've moved to a different state and tried to keep busy, but time isn'to go to class but i'm planning to just drop them all. i'm a former marine and spent time in iraq and afghanistan, but that's nothing compared to losing my baby the way i lost her."
none,anxiety,4,"i'm feeling very discouraged. i have a fever, sore throat and cold and my bunk mates and i confirmed we have bed bug bites this morning. the hostel confirmed it and now i'm hanging around waitt bitten. not sure if the washing machine will fit my bag. i have only been on this trip 4 days and while the travelling has been amazing, bed bugs and sick to start off with has been horrible."
depression,adhd,6,"it's really silly, but i need to walk one egg a day, do one raid and get 10'000xp. that's the only freaking thing i can get done in a day. it has no value, but at least it's something."
ptsd,depression,13,"i had a few very traumatic events happen to me over the course of about 3 years. as a result, i really don’t trust in anything or anyone anymore. i managed to get married and really do trust my partner, but not anyone else. i just moved across the country and i’m findien through to harm me. it gets really exhausting because i’m really lonely here since i don’t know anybody which exacerbates my depression. it’s like, i have the desire to try and make friends but what i’ve been through just won’t let me. it’s such an isolating feeling."
adhd,anxiety,19,"just in case anyone isn't aware of what learned helplessness feels like, and as a warning to people not to keep trying the same thing over and over, i've written the following. i will use the term ""brain"" to refer to the unconscious, impulsive parts of the brain, the parts that aren't ""you"", and ""you"" to refer to your conscious experience and rational brain. (disclaimer, this is only my experience, i don't know what other people's experiences are.) --- imagine walking around, going through life, except you don't decide what you do. your brain decides everything for you and you have no say. it wants to play video games, so you play video games. that isn't to say you don't fight it, but on those occasions that you do you either are simply unable to do anything, or every frustration with yourself for every past failure floods upon you, washing your willpower away in a tidal wave of anxiety. you quickly learn the only way to fight is to not fight at all. --- now, imagine somebody calmly tells you, ""i know it's hard, but you really need to just get up and do it. i have no magic bullet unfortunately."" this is nice, they know that you have a hard time ""just doing it"" but at this point there's no way around it, it just needs to be done. you wholeheartedly agree with them, and feel like the ultimate solution _is_ to ""just do it"". your brain however immediately reminds you how ""it's never worked before, so why will it work now?"" this isn't just a small voice, it is backed by the combined anxiety of every failure and inadequacy you have ever had. --- i'll attempt to explain what lies behind this sense of hopelessness: this sense of hopelessness, in its simplest form, is the feeling that ""it's never worked, so why would it change?"" however, it goes deeper than that. the following is the main thought process: - according to other people you just need to try hard enough to solve the problem - you feel like you have tried counn't care anymore"" ( ditto ) - ""i hate myself"" (when i metaphorically close my eyes, cover my ears, and run from what i need to do yelling ""lalalalalalalala"", also when i am sitting doing something i enjoy and remember what i'm supposed to be doing) - ""i just can't."" (when i try to calm myself or when i'm lying in a fetal position on the bed, spiraling deeper into depression) - ""i just want the world to go away"" (this feeling makes me realize why some people kill themselves. i fortunately just retreat to my bed or some form of entertainment that allows my brain to shut off temporarily) --- i'm not saying this is permanent problem, or that there aren't any solutions, just that it's incredibly difficult, more difficult than i feel most anyone can imagine. it's the torture of hopelessness, with the frustration of fully knowing with your rational brain that hope itself is all that is needed to solve the problem, yet finding that hope hopelessly far away. please, everyone. think before you tell someone to ""just try."" they may have forgotten how to. --- edit: some people may say that you just need to build in systems, and i agree that that is a good solution, but at least for me, i've tried so many of my own systems that even trying to talk with it causes my brain to lock up with anxiety. likely because it forces me to confront all my past failures, which further discourages me from trying. i'd still love to hear any advice people have though. --- tl;dr; learned helplessness isn't thinking you are helpless, it is feeling that you've forgotten how to try. if you really wanted to try it would have worked, since people say to just try, so you must not really _want_ to try, so you begin to instead want to want to try. in addition, confronting it in any way brings with it all the anxiety of every past failure, meaning that often, instead of doing something you often fail to do you just close your eyes and hope it'll go away."
adhd,none,22,"i often have people bring up songs/albums/bands or movies/tv shows during conversation. they might say, ""have you seen or heard x?"" and if i have i will say ""yeah, i liked it, enjoyed it etc etc etc"". however,lsive liar who says they like things just to fit in when in reality i just cannot remember many details, lines, names or lyrics, just i enjoyed said movie/show/album etc. anyone else get this? feelsbadman.jpeg."
adhd,bipolar,26,"most people able to be productive and functional when their basic needs are fulfilled... so do i! but what different is what i need is fun and exciting stuffs (or my meds) for me to be able to being productive and ""functional"" (or my brain will be potato). people can't go on if they are hungry, i can still go on all day all night if i have my squishies or after hearing a good song in spotify which gives me my spurts of dopamines!"
anxiety,depression,27,"i’ve been working for about 7 months, this is the longest i have held down a job. i’ve gotten a car and started driving for the first time and going places by myself, i’ve madew driver but i’m sure i’ll get the hang of it. i just thought i’d share for anyone who is still struggling. 7 months ago i was completely lost and now i know what’s best for me."
ptsd,depression,28,"i know that's a very ""wtf"" topic title, but weird times call for weird celebrations. just googled him for the first time in eons and found new news articles. now i'm just sitting here laughing at how thoroughly he's fucked up his life. probation violation :) actually, twelve of em, but who's counting? **he has** ***nothing*** **left**. he has forfeited a high-paying licensed career, almost a decade of life outside prison now, his well-kozen lives is probably never going to be happy again. :) *was it worth it, my good bitch? would you make the same life choices and still be a degenerate piece of shit...or do you regret it a lil by this point?* i'm just so fucking jazzed at this news. that violent waste of oxygen can eat shit and taste his own karma. **may all the terrible people in your life end up ruining their own lives with their gratuitously awful decisions too :)**"
adhd,depression,29,...and you still waste your fucking time on your phone and only end up doing some of it at least it's better than nothing but yeah this was me the other day. i stayed up all night at my work to catch up on things that i'm way behind in
depression,anxiety,32,"i felt like this very often lately. it's terrifies me. i keep telling myself that this is all just in my head, but is it true? or is it merely a comforting thoungt i am desperately clinging to? (sorry for my terrible english.)"
adhd,depression,34,"seriously. i never realized other people struggled with as many of the same things that i struggle with. finding this community helped me realize that i'm not alone, and helped me better understand my mental illness. i am so grateful."
ptsd,depression,41,i can't function. i have a test in the morning and a final exam thursday that i won't be attending. she ran away and got hit by a car and died. i don't know how i'm going to go on. i can't live without her.
depression,anxiety,44,it's been like this for 4 years now and i'm getting so tired of that constant thought just bouncing around in my head. it makes me even more depressed to know that that i cant handle any minor incovenience without thinking about suicide first. i used to think this shit couldn't get much worse but i was so wrong.
adhd,depression,45,"i see your, our, struggle. evolution made us this way for a reason. we have a purpose. but it's really fucking hard to find that in this fucked up modern society. imagine. lots  structure or organisation. ok maybe bring a handful of neurotypicals for the paperwork. yeah i'm in total denial of the world we actually live in. too painful to face the truth."
bipolar,depression,51,"you are climbing a mountain, it's hell, you want to give up , you push on and when you finally think you can't take another step, someone passes you on the way back down and tells you it's just 5 more minutes. a grueling ten minutes pass, you collapse on a rock and drop your pack. you see the summit. you lie on the ground for ten more minutes trying to shake out the last drops of water from the bottle into your mouth and they dribble down your face instead. you brought double the water everyone else did and it wasn't enoughiew was beautiful, you should see the view from the peak, it's amazing, so worth the trip, and you go wtf. you know night will come eventually, climbing up that mountain, never reaching the ""summit"", uncertain of how many hours you have left. only that night will come and then the struggle will end. stop making false promises that ""it will get better"". stop asking me to believe in fairytales. i don't want another false hope only to be shattered again like a glass falling to hard floor. i am so tired of picking up the pieces."
bipolar,depression,53,"hey bpr, it's been a minute. i wish i could say i was doing well, but then i'd be lying. i'm okay, i guess? i'm barely on reddit anymore because i have no energy to deal with any aspect of my life outside of work (including my return to finish my last class for college, which will hopefully happen in the next couple months.) i'd been making my job my only priority when it finally hit me the other night... these people do not respect me. when i told them i wanted a different position (that paid less) they didn't listen. and when my coworker started telling me about the stuff they've done to him... that was the final straw for me. i can't do it anymore. am i depressed? i definitely have reason to be.p of this, my uncle just passed from cancer a month ago... just a month after his son died in his sleep (we still don't know what happened there.) but i'm finally getting my life in order. in the past several months i've quit alcohol, klonopin and cigarettes. i paid off all the money i owed my college so i could return. and i pretty much sacrificed my existence just to make that money. what else is new? well, i just turned 30. maybe i feel like i'm a little too old for this... but for the most part, this milestone just makes me want to change things for the better. hope you've all been doing well... i missed you guys. and thanks for those of you who reached out to me... i'm hoping to be around more."
depression,anxiety,55,"we've been dating the past month and i got the balls to ask her out. she said she'll think about it which means no, but i still got the nerve to do it! 😃"
depression,adhd,59,"it took massive amounts of energy, but somehow i accomplished something today. i woke up just in time before the garbage pickup came. it's so hard just to stay afloat and not stay in bed so these little victories have to count for something. it seems like forcing myself to do everything in the morning will lead to more productivity, it's tough. i remember when i had the energy to do all these things without even thinking twice."
bipolar,none,60,"it's happening again. time has slowed by the tiniest of fractions all the infinite of paths have become slightly less infinite, and slightly less impossible impossibility is eroding...again yesterday's tasks, which seemed so heavy, so futile, so devoid of hope are now infused with the knowledge that all tasks are as light as you make them, as important as you deem them, and hoping that this feeling can stay it's happening again. time is reminding me that it can't cease to exist the click of time's tongue can change it's tone depending on how i choose to unwrap it's gifts like friendship, it can never leave you, it can never speed up, it can never enour nothingness my ego claims the well-known eyes are kinder with their gaze, but it knows better they know better i know better. it's happening again. the arena of my mind changes with each breath, with each thought from challenge to shelter to prison to dead end my arena transforms until it doesn't until it's a step behind until it's steps behind it's happening again. my mind cannot keep up with my arena my arena will not keep up with my mind the clock ticks slower now until it doesn't. time is up. the focus is narrowed. the narrowed is focused. this is all gibberish nonsense...time has changed it all. impossibility is growing. it's happened again."
none,bipolar,61,i'm flying from dallas to hong kong in january and it's 17 hours. i've flown 12-13 hour flights before and they really mess with me. so i'm wondering - what are your tips for not going crazy on such a long flight? ps: i'm terrible at sleeping on planes. thinking about taking some sleepy meds to see if it'll help
anxiety,ptsd,64,"i took the first step. i’ve been struggling so much for the past few months. it’s gotten to the point that i’m barely sleeping and when i do, i have insane nightmares. a couple weeks ago i booked a therapy appointment and it was today. i stood outside the building and came very close to just leaving because the idea of opening up about what i’m strug; if you’re wondering if you should start looking for a therapist, do it. if you’ve found a therapist that seems interesting but you’re not sure if you should reach out, do it. if you’ve made an appointment but you’re not sure if you should attend, attend it. and if you’re standing outside wondering if you should go in, go in. it will help, i promise."
bipolar,depression,65,i love how easy it is to go from not giving one shit about what other people think to giving all the shits. the paranoia that people are talking about me.t thought i really was just a horrible person. at least now i know that i just have a broken brain and not just a completely broken/ defective as a person.
depression,anxiety,73,"i feel like i almost get some weird sense of satisfaction when i'm in a cycle of self loathing. i don't feel happy during it, but there's something addicting about having that nasty inner critic voice just shit on me and my seld any resistance to it feels straining and requires a lot of mental effort. tl;dr anyone else feel a sense of catharsis when you have a spiral of negative thoughts of yourself? any tips for getting out of that cycle of thoughts?"
depression,ptsd,75,"anyone else fantasize about this? this thought has become extremely dominant in my mind lately. i would love to see how ""friends"" and family react to my death. as dark as it sounds i can't help but feel curious. just a day or two of mourning and then back to normal. forgotten. just like how people forget i still exist now."
bipolar,depression,79,"i know it doesn't seem like a big deal, but my room has been squalid lately. i was terrorized by a huge cockroach last night. i heard it scurrying around, but alas i could not find it because my floor was covered in clothes, empty wine bottles, bills i can't pay and random pills strewn about. the stank of shame hung heavy in the air, or maybe it was just my dirty laundry. i don't know. anyway, i think i'm doing better today. i don't feel as abjectly miserable as i normally do. i honestly feel like sisyphus most days. maybe the wellbutrin is finally kicking in? 🤔 friday would have been my two year anniversary with my fiance, but he left just like everyone else. my faith in humanity has been annihilated,cted me because i had substance abuse problems. thank god and fuck you dr. hahn. 🖕 anyway. things are looking up for me. i have been in deep despair since september of last year. i've never been consistently... depressed? for that long. i hesitate to call it a depression, because my typical depressive symptoms aren't present. i don't really know what exactly is the matter with me. ect fried my brain, that's all i know. so that happened. maybe it was a positive thing since i haven't tried to off myelf since the procedure, yet everything feels so foreign to me. i can no longer identify what sort of episode i'm in. i just feel... numb. if unseasoned chicken breast was a feeling, that's how i'd describe it."
ptsd,bipolar,82,"not all that unusual where i work actually. the supervisor i broke down in front of had his own breakdown about 8 years ago. its an engineering company that specializes in large, high risk sort of projects. so lots of crazy hours and stress. without realizing it, i went something like a week without sleep. i was supposeannot be on most meds), and various other things. nope....i get a couple of emails detailing the online videos i have to watch. ""sexual harassment: always a bad touch"", ""work place violence: serpentine to success"", ""msds and you"", along with ""export proprietary controls for intellectual property"" our hr department sucks."
none,bipolar,85,"im a high schooler starting to consider my future, and im open to anything that allows me to work for a bit and then travel for months at a time. it doesnt have to be especially lucrative, just as long as its not a minimim wage job"
bipolar,depression,95,because any kind of sickness is more tolerable than depression when it gets bad. i feel guilty for being around others when i might be contagious but it's what i have to do.
bipolar,none,96,"it does a really good job of exploring the ways in which traditional eastern religion and modern neuroscience overlap. if you're interested in how meditation/mindfulness techniques can help with managing your swings, definitely check it out. most of the content is available for free on google books."
bipolar,depression,99,the creditors cannot chase me anymore. i won’t be able to buy a house or get credit again (thank god). bankruptcy can come across as a dirty word but 25% interest on a 5k credit card while i’m a student is just fucked up. i feel free.
none,bipolar,103,"i recently received $467,000 from two federal grants to launch a community based participatory research study to understand the challenges and success factors for autistic people in the workplace. the study focuses od settings. my study will seek to understand what helps autistic people do well professionally, and develop a plan to improve professional outcomes. i will be back at 7 pm et to answer your questions, ask me anything!"
adhd,anxiety,107,"you know how sometimes you'll just remember something in the past you did and cringe at yourself and its like, kinda physically painful? that's the feeling i'm talking about. for most people it just kinda comes and goes and they are fine bearing it for a moment, however i seem to either be hypersensitive to the feeling or just really bad at regulating it (probably a bit of both tbh), as half the time ""i wanna punch myself"" doesn't stop at just being a descriptor of how and feel and ends up being a bit of how i cope with it til it passes :/ i'll end up hitting myself on my leg or arm or something or punching a nearby wall as a way to relieve the tension, never hard enough to leave a lasting mark but often enough to be worrisome. i know it's not healthy but i don't know what else to do cuz the feeling is otherwise ui'll end up having a panic attack, yet i pretty much never actively avoid possible triggers and even signed up for my school's improv and dance clubs completely out of my own freewill (actually participating, however, is a different matter). basically, never happens to me lol. does anyone have any advice on better ways to cope with the cringe feelings, or with just emotional regulation in general? i'm on ritalin ir rn and while it does seem to help a bit, the problem is still very present, especially later in the evening or at night where i'm more tired and the meds have worn off. **tl;dr i have general emotional regulation problems and specifically always end up coping with ""cringe"" feelings with self harm. does anyone have advice on healthier ways to cope or other general help with emotional regulation?** thanks!"
bipolar,ptsd,109,"i'm just curious to see if this happens to anyone else; the title is pretty self explanatory. (tl;dr at bottom) i don't mean like i'm ""out of it"" or even just fatigued for the day and my brain loses its train of thought one too many times. i feel like that happens to everyone at least once in a while (including myself). i mean like it takes an insane amount of mental energy for me to say a sentence from start to finish correctly, usually takes me a few tries to do so. so to say a 3 sentence response to somethiow to speak in general. anyone else have similar experiences? tl;dr: does anyone sometimes find their speech to be very impaired, like you feel as if you forgot how to speak at all? maybe due to an episode, personal issues, both, etc? edit: thank you so much everyone who replied to this post, sharing your experiences and such. one of my biggest insecurities is my speech (due to the issue mentioned in this post) and it's so comforting to have so much nice, supportive feedback and to know i'm not alone on this :)"
anxiety,depression,113,"it started off okay, i was answering questions, trying to get to know the 2 interviewers. then the ceo of the company asked a question, i began to answer, and he kept interrupting me when i began to talk. this totally derailed my train of thought, stressed me out to the max, and i started to cry. i did regain composure and finish the interview but i just want to crawl into a hole and die. the thought of going to another interview, even at another company, and i start crying all over again. help."
adhd,none,115,"from an article i just read: &amp;#x200b; *the chaotic, ephemeral eddies under his grandfather's rowboat are a perfect image of nelson's style of thought. i was already taping our conversation, but nelson clearly wanted his own record. not because he was concerned about being quoted correctly, but because his tape recorder and video camera are weapons in an unending battle against amnesia. the inventor suffers from an extreme case of attention deficit disorder, a recently named psychological syndrome whose symptoms include unusual sensitivity to interruption.* *if he is stopped in the middle of anything, he forgets it instantly. only by running his own tape recorder could nelson be confident that his words would not float off, irrecoverably, into the atmosphere.* *nand a filmmaker, but he needed a way to avoid getting lost in the frantic multiplication of associations his brain produced. his great inspiration was to imagine a computer program that could keep track of all the divergent paths of his thinking and writing. to this concept of branching, nonlinear writing, nelson gave the name* *although the concept of hypertext made nelson legendary in programming circles, he is not a programmer. ""i have a terrific math problem,"" nelson said. ""i still can't add up a checkbook: i can add a column of figures five times, get four different answers, and none of them will be right. i'm very accident-prone and extremely impatient. i can't work my macintosh - i have three that are completely unfunctional and one is marginally functional.""*"
bipolar,depression,116,"so i have been working my ass off the past 2 1/2 years to get my head back together and take a bunch of classes i needed for education endorsements so i could get into masters in teaching program. i just found out i got into the program!!! wooo i'm going to grad school! 3 years ago i could barely get out of bed, this spring i'll be learning to teach at an excellent school and i just felt like sharing with people who would get how big of a deal this is to me. i am so happy."
ptsd,anxiety,119,"i went to a pool party this weekend for a friend's birthday i made playing dnd. one of the guys there picked me up in the water, i said ""i don't like touching,"" and he dunked me. he brought me back up, and i said ""stop! i don't like touching,"" and he dunked me again. a group of his friends was standing very close and could have stopped it, but i wasn't listened to with the respect i deserved. so, this guy got to grab me, put me in a panic attack, and have a great party with no repercussions. meanwally my mother failed to believe me and extract me from a nightmarish situation. just like i did everything right at the party and a group of my so-called nerd friends left me to deal with the situation on my own. i've also been struggling with feeling like i'm making a big deal out of a small flirtatious move. but it's the speaking my boundaries and wishes and having them ignored that feels so, so much like i'm 8 again. i'm 8, and i just have to acquiesce to a man's wishes and not consider my own."
anxiety,adhd,122,"i can't sit still when i get my eyebrows done, and when i'm in class i usually doodle to focus. i pay attention very well in school regardless of that, and drawing helps me focus."

anxiety,adhd,134,"hey all, i've noticed recently that i've been putting things where they don't belong, or opening cabinets to look for things that i know are in another cabinet. i'm 20. sometimes i'll be walking and i'll have to ask myself ""where  constantly or i'll remember that i never went somewhere i was supposed to and then think about it and think ""wait, yes i did do that/go there."" it's really scaring the shit out of me. anyone else have these types of memory lapses?"
adhd,depression,138,"you know that feeling when your willpower gas tank is empty, all your energy to keep pushing is burnt, and you have to take a break? getting to that point and working through makes me extremely uncomfortable, and it's the closet thing to physical pain i can imagine without actually being it. hard things cost even more energy than theyseriously when i tell him i need break, or i can't do this alone, especially when we're behind schedule on things. which is always. can anyone help me explain to him why i can't just ""buckle down and ride it out"" like he always has? edit: thank you everyone for your responses! i hope others find them as helpful to their lives as i have"
bipolar,depression,140,"i have lied to my friends and family for a very long time. it goes beyond the ""how are you?"" and ""fine, thank you"" dialogue. i lived with a smile on my face and i told myself that i was strong. i recently had an episode where i couldn't fake it anymore. i became really really sick. and now, the people i love are asking me questions because theyd never hurt her like that. my mom looked so shocked. i want to keep lying and putting up a face. but the truth is that i'm exhausted and really tired of acting like someone i'm not. and i know that my family and friends are asking questions because they want to understand and help me, but i want them to continue seeing me as ""smiley joojoobar."""
bipolar,ptsd,145,"so about a week ago my wife and i moved back from georgia to texas. we thought me driving all the way from georgia (she has no license) at night to texas in one teering wheel. then my vision started to swirl. i had to call the police to escort us to the nearest hotel. people, your medicine is very important. please take it."
anxiety,ptsd,149,"i quit my job today. it was fucking terrible. not quitting, but being there. from september, i've had the worst time working there and trying my best for an abusive relationship. it took every fiber of my being to go through with it, but i feel like i've shed a ten ton husk. long time lurker, but i had to make an account to post this."
adhd,bipolar,155,"so my last job was kind of a shit-show. i was having real issues with focus and staying interested at my last-last job (this was before i was diagnosed) and going through a lot of personal stuff in my life (divorce) i wanted to make more money, and get a change, and prove to my ex that i was capable. i let pride blind me, and i applied for a job as an embedded engineer with a local company. well... due to moving needs in the company, they decided they didn't really need an embedded guy at the time, and brought me on as a c# software developer to try me out. i volunteered on a large scale embedded project, learned a bunch of great embedded skills, and did a project my talents at day's end. i'm honestly pretty sure he was surprised as i was that i was let go, but the decision was made way above his head. i was pretty fuckin' bummed for the last month. anyway. just got a call yesterday from a small company looking to bring on a senior fpga engineer to lead their satellite technology development, and i believe i'm perfect for the role. i've always wanted to put stuff in to space, so i'm very stoked right now. i'm hoping the interview goes well, and that i manage to impress them. i could really use the win right now. also, now that i've got the meds, and i've got the right therapy, i really think this will be my chance to shine."
none,adhd,161,"maybe this way of saying it is fine, but when people ask around and compare test scores, i genuinely believe and want to tell people that they shouldn't focus on what other people scored but focus on themselves and their own work. i don't want to sound too formal or even rude since i am a student. so how should i reply to people asking whatever test mark i received?"
adhd,depression,164,ever since i can remember i've always been an extremely curious person and if i ever overheard someone talking about something like a secret or drama i would be dying to know what they were talking about and beg them to let me know too. right now i find myself absolutely torturing myself over my ex girlfriends in i grew to be such a manipulative person. so am i just nosey or you guys like this too? i also hate hate hate when someone starts to tell me something then says never mind and cuts it off. it can literally ruin the rest of my day if they refuse to tell me what they were gonna say (until i forget about it at least)

adhd,bipolar,270,"wow, i am overwhelmed by everyone's support! let me clarify a few things with some background info: after 4 1/2 long years, i graduate in a month. in fact, last night i was finishing up my capstone project that's due today and i was having the hardest time because i put half of it off until last minute and i'm stressed the fuck out. anyway, even though i made it through college, i'm now being faced with new challenges and a shit ton of deadlines. i'm graduating in a few weeks, yet i missed a doctors appointment recently because i forgot, still have trouble with not wasting my time for hours and have two labs that are kicking my ass and i can't keep up. however, this morning i woke up to a reminder that though it's an uphill battle, especially while managing bipolar disorder, that i really am doing better than i think. whether you're freshman in the same shoes i was in four years ago, or are thriving the career you worked your ass off for, your advice, encouragement and the courage to open up have inspired the hell out of me. every single one of you. that being said, i want to share something in return that i hope will encourage you as well: i was never a model student. i dicked around in high school (on the days i actually went lol). i was your standard class clown. my grades were average, but i was always late and had to work extra hard to keep up. senior year, i accepted that since nobody believed i would make it through my first year of college, it was probably true. my first year, i was eust like your heart, meaning mental health issues should be combatted just like you would any other part of your body. you can't just one day decide that because you've changed your mindset that you don't have heart disease, just like you can't do that with adhd. obviously. the good news is, is that together, by sharing our experiences and simple solutions, we can at least all go about this knowing that we are not alone. i understand not everyone has access to resources such as medication and therapy, and i truly respect anyone who has gone without. ultimately, it is coming to the realization that you are the one who has to initially seek help, which is hard when it's hard to do anything in the first place. if you are reading this, that means you are already one step ahead because you're on this subreddit. thank you to everyone who has taken the time to share your time management solutions, love and other things you've done that have helped you with daily tasks. these are valuable insights that can truly make a difference. i took some advice i read in a comment on another thread and had a productive day yesterday. it wasn't much, my damn it was satisfying when i looked at how much i'd crossed of my to-do list. alright, so i have to get back to my project but i could not ignore the outpouring of support from my fellow adhders. also, if anyone has any questions or just needs somebody to talk to, message me. i'm so glad i found this community. remember, you're awesome. go kick today's ass. cheers"
ptsd,anxiety,281,i've started to use cbd oil to manage my anxiety and i feel like a person again. i have energy to both accept any negative feelings i have and still put out a positivity to other people. which is something i strugglebetter in public in general. i can focus when i read and not forget things because i don't have my brain going a mile a minute. this stuff makes me feel like my life has changed drastically. i'm so grateful it exists.
adhd,anxiety,284,every single day it's the same. i'm 2 minutes late which has me run the way to the train station. it's always those 2 minutes. i hate it. i start hating myself for it. it keeps happening. why? and who else? how do you cope? it's a common pattern btw. also includes deadlines and other things. i'm always the exact amount of time late to make things uncomfortable.
adhd,depression,286,"i picked up this new book called the subtle art of not giving a f*** from one of my favorite writers, mark manson and i've found it incredibly useful for dealing with both my day to day and future goals. one of my favorite quotes from the book is this: *“the desire forsing your fucks on that. anyway, if the above quotes sparked your interest i highly recommend purchasing the book. there are many fantastic subtleties to the topic that i couldn't possibly put down into a short post and mark manson is a great. peace and have a good day."
bipolar,anxiety,287,"i've been feeling needy and ignored lately, the thing is i'm not interacting with anyone really outside my so. it's too much to handle right now. and my so gives me cuddles and is being helpful. there is really no one to ignore me, you know? but i just feel bad for some reason. i can't figure it out. i'm even upset when people don't reply or upvote my posts and that is really weird because i don't usually notice votes. i ruminate over whether i said the wrong thing or upset someone. i don't always reply to people i've gone into crisis i managed. i dunno, i felt a little weird after a session a few weeks ago. kinda like emdr weird and the session was kinda an unconscious exploring one, not emdr but a different therapy. i keep going back to that. i am left with just vague feelings i don't understand and just feeling uneasy. this is really bugging me. i keep expecting it to resolve, but when i'm resting or taking a time out to recharge it's really on my mind. and i feel unusually sensitive of late,since that weird appointment."
anxiety,depression,291,"so the title sums it up. i'm almost 28, all my friends are engaged, married or have a clatter of children. i have never even had a boyfriend in my life. i've had ""friend with benefits"" who in reality were not friends and have not benefitted me. i can see now i was used a practice girl before they moved onto women they actually care about. i have social anxiety and hate myself so expect others to hate me too. things like eye contact are very difficult. i use alcohol as a tool to try and be fun but it never really works out. not e first time in my life, he dumped me before i got that far. i'm not angry, i don't blame him, he just didn't feel the same way i do. it's left me absolutely broken. i believe im not good enough for anyone and don't see the point in going on anymore. i just go through the motions every day without feeling anything. i am on meds and see a doctor regularly but nothing helps. i tried counselling and could not talk. i have a history involving suicide and sexual assault and so trust is hard for me. i don't know where to go from here."
depression,anxiety,301,"i'm not sure where to post this, i just need to talk about it. two days ago my mother was told she had 3 weeks left to live. she couldn't move or talk and her breathing was fast. two weeks before that she was in remission for breast cancer and fine then fast forward to now and the problem was her liver, they had to keep draining fluid.. last night she said one thing to me, i's heart breaking. i want to sleep forever and cry all day. i'm depressed and miss my mom. edit- thank you to everyone who commented such nice things and messages of support. it really helped to read through some of them and realize i'm not alone and she is without pain and suffering now. to have so many people care about someone they never met is amazing and i have no words."

adhd,depression,307,"video games, weed, watching porn, eating fatty foods, drinking, etc. these are all things i find very hard to control. when i smoke a bit of weed i crave more instantly and i don't stop smoking until i'm baked out of my mind. whenever i'm feeling bad i start overeating, which leads to me feeling worse, which leads to more overeating. whenever i feel bored (which is quite often) i play video games. this leads to me using only video games for pleasure and to esccult emotions, and i dull myself with unhealthy behaviours, instead of just accepting the emotions and processing them in a healthy way. when i stop using these behaviours the negative thoughts and emotions start hitting me very hard. but probably that's just a phase you have to go through, to get out better on the otherside. are there others who struggle with balancing life like me? if you've found a solution, please elaborate. is this just a discipline thing?"

none,depression,468,"it's not that we lose power all the time, internet is slow, poverty, hassling, haggling, scams, the things that most people hate... it's that it has made me so goddamn cynical. i have to assume that anyone who's indian that approaches us, wants to take something from us. i talk to a man for 5 minutes and he invites us to dinner. he probably wantsy speak a word. i'm to the point where i'm about to just completely ignore any passerby who attempts to speak with us. is that too much? any advice on coping with this kind of cynicism? i can't afford not to be vigilant like this, because i feel like i'd be sacrificing safety. but i also hate not being able to give people the benefit of the doubt."

adhd,ptsd,477,"sometimes i feel like i'm thinking of nothing but i'm really thinking about what i'm thinking and that, of course, is distracting. it's almost like a ""meta-conversation"" about the conversation or whatever i'm doing. in it i analyze body language,add brain can explain how a non-add brain experiences conversation? (or life, lol) (this comes from a conversation a friend. i asked her if she ever ""thinks about her thoughts."" she looked at me strangely, couldn't really understand the concept.)"
bipolar,depression,479,"i have no motivation to do anything. i don’t go to my one online class, i don’t get off of my couch except for when my dog needs me to, i can’t clean, i can’t do the laundry, my dishes are piling up, and i still can’t make myself get off of this couch. how do y’all push through? what are little things you do to get out of this?"
anxiety,depression,481,"sounds conceited, but i am. and nobody to talk to about it. kids dad ended up getting a damn dui with our two kids in the car. 😡 cys (child protective services) ended up coming to my house to talk to me and the kids  and i didn't even cry. everything is fine now. it wasn't as hard as i thought it was! :,) to do something that makes me proud of me... im in a happy daze. now if only i can be brave enough to leave this post up.. lol"
anxiety,depression,483,"yes. you. the person reading this right now. you're amazing. i'm telling you because you probably don't hear it as much as you deserve to. because you're battling some really tough things that most people won't ever understand. because even though you're doing that, and it's hell, you're s to see you through the storms. because there will be storms. maybe you're in the storm right now. you'll get through it. because you're strong, stronger than you think you are. you're incredible and strong, and i know you can do it. i have faith in you. i'm here for you. you. are. amazing."
ptsd,anxiety,486,"i was 21 at the time, now i'm 22. in may of 2017, i got really sick out of no where. in a matter of 3 days, i went from feeling slightly out of it, to intense thunderclap headaches, pale, body aches, delirium, and ultimately passing out. i didn't want to make a scene or go to the hospital because i was just starting a new full time job, but i had a feeling that i was going to die. i can't really explain that very well, but i just knew deep down that someone was very wrong. at 4am i took an uber to the hospital and when i got there, upon checking my vitals (very low blood pressure and 160 resting heart rate) the nurses helped me onto a wheelchair and wheeled me into a bed in the intensive care unit. at this point, my memory is very groggy but i remember multiple people helping me take my clothes off to change me into a gown, and then doing an ecg on me. they got an iv into me and gave me a valium injection, as well as nausea medicine. i thought that was odd because i didn't feel nauseous at the time. the doctor came in and asked me what was wrong. i just cried and said my head hurt so bad, adn't push me too hard my fist few weeks back (i have a very physical job). now i'm healthier, but i still have a constant fear of getting sick again. i try to explain this to my mom and friends, but they think i'm just being dramatic and a hypochondriac. i don't feel safe anywhere but the hospital. i'm constantly scared. i don't have a fear of death, but knowing that i could easily become diseased and suffer, and leave all that i love behind makes me sad. it makes me sad that people don't understand what i went through. they are not educated on sepsis and think well ""hey, she didn't have cancer"" (my coworker actually said that, and later attributed my sepsis to being a vegetarian). i really don't talk about it a lot, but when i do, i get eye rolls. it's like people think i enjoyed taking a month off work. i constantly suffer from panic attacks now, where i feel dizzy and can't breathe well, but there's not much i can do about that. ativan doesn't help. my body and mind have been through hell and no one understands, or gives a shit. thank you for reading, i just had to get this off my chest."
bipolar,anxiety,490,the school year is finally starting! i've been going in on extra days to decorate my classroom. it's pretty much decorated and now i'm organizing my cabinets since they're a mess with random stuff shoved places. i think by the start of the year i'll have stuff totally organized. i'm so so so excited! it gives me a sense of worse. i'm sure the kids will stress me out when they come and i'll get all anxious but for now i'm having a great time.
bipolar,depression,491,"i live in south texas. the weather here is always humid and hot as balls, however we are finally beginning to see some weather changes. it was pouring almost all day yesterday and this morning when i walked out of my apartment to leave for work, it was fresh! fresh and cloudy and so beautiful, but then i started to feel the depression creeping in. for fuck's sake *eyerolls so fucking hard*"
bipolar,depression,499,"it doesn't seem to be related to depression. i don't feel depressed, i just feel really in need of sleep. the only problem here is that i'm soon to be employed again and i know i won't be able to just do this whenever i want. but it feels like ... a necessity, like going to the bathroom or something. my body just takes over and i need that sleep. does this happen to anyone else? how do you navigate it?"
bipolar,anxiety,521,i can feel the floor dropping out like the last time i was hospitalized. i can't go back there. it was traumatic. i've tried every med and i'm terrified. i turn into a fpecting from this. i can't live like this. how do people make it? i can't believe i have to lose myself over and over until i die. i can't fucking do this. i'm so scared.

depression,bipolar,524,"kinda shitty advice. but i'll start with some backstory. i'm on mobile so forgive me. (this will be kinda rambly) i was diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety disorder after i checked into a psychiatric hospital a few years back, but i always felt as i grew up that something was wrong. when i went to go meet my biological mother (who is very bipolar) when i was 18 things started to click with me that i needed to figure out a way to find meaning. it didn't help that my step-mom was an abusive cunt. so overall i kinda suck at being a person.(still do) anyways, i've struggled with constantly feeling down, and also feeling a whole lotta shit i didn't really understand. because of this i turned to weed and alcohol when i was 15. went through a few phases of drinking hard, but really weed was my poison of choice(still dont think it's bad but that's for another sub). again anyways because of the plant i kinda regained a sense of what it meant to be a healthy functioning member of society, but it was  pay the rent, things get complicated with family, with work, with life. and all of it together makes me wanna opt out. but then i think of leaving him by himself to deal with it himself and what a living hell that would be. even if i cant do much, ill do what i can till i can't. because if i dont that would make me sadder than anything i can ever encounter in my life. my point is that out there there are strong, amazing, incredibly intelligent and driven people, who do this shit alone. while feeling everything. and its heart breaking. my dad spent his life trying to make me feel welcome when every fiber of my being says i don't belong on this earth. the least i can do is gtfo bed and try to do something. even if my battle that day is just to brush my teeth. so that he can see a good looking smile that he made. to make him feel just a little better. that's my part, my mission. thats what gets me up. there are people that can use your help, and you owe it to them. but that s just my opinion."
bipolar,ptsd,529,"35(m), recently divorced and lost my job on monday due to a nervous breakdown. i'm in the first week of 30 day outpatient treatment program, seeing the psychiatrist tues. ex (43f) didn't believe my need for mental health care and we got in plenty of fights over it throughout our 8 years. the irony is that she's a nurse. she left me for my boss w and it feels like a victory to have the opportunity to see a therapist 3x a week after being told for years that i wasn't permitted or the relationship would suffer or end. i spend lots of time right now laying on my back staring at the ceiling while ugly crying. i've read a bunch of your stories and i think you're all very strong. much respect."
anxiety,depression,534,"i constantly feel like i’m being lied to. i overanalyze things, my brain always finds a way to twisted things people say so it seems like a lie. my head hurts and i often cry. things started to feel like this since i was being cheated on 6 years ago."

adhd,ptsd,578,"often times i'll get distracted from my thoughts either by external influences or just another idea coming in, and then i have to spend a good 5 minutes trying to work out what i was thinking about again."
adhd,anxiety,581,"so... you know the thing where you get way over invested for about a month and then completely forget about them? i do that, a lot. so i came up with this plan. in hindsight i’m not sure why i ever thought it would work. it seemed like a good idea at the time. it goes like this: if i date someone i’m not interested in, i won’t obsess. if i don’t obsess i won’t get bored, iin mouth filter. if he asks why i don’t think it’ll work, currently all i’ve got is ‘i just find you boring’. i can’t say that to him. i just can’t. i might have to date him for eternity just to avoid it. so, yeah. psa: finding them boring from the start doesn’t stop you finding them boring later. also: how do i ditch him without hurting him?? tl;dr: bored of a guy, again."

depression,none,615,i hate the fact that euthanasia is not legal in the u.s. imagine being severely sick and suffering and people forcing you to stay alive. that seems like a form of torture to me. i wish guns where legal were i live i would have killed myself a long time ago.

depression,bipolar,637,i've been in a major depressive episode for the last two years or so and lately i find myself only brushing my teeth maybe once a day and showering only once a week. i was just wondering if anyone else struggles with this at different times during a depressive episode.
adhd,depression,638,"so, you've spent a while working hard at school/life/career/relationships. things have been going well, and all of a sudden some much needed time off comes along. you've got half the week off, and the other half is pretty light in comparison, so it's the fucking best. you can slack off a little bit, and let your mind wander, and there's no ill effects, because everyone does iticult. you got this. slowly scale back your bed time and get a little more rest each night. try to set some reasonable alarms for yourself this weekend, so you keep up the pattern of waking up before noon, and try to make a short to do list to be able to check off some accomplishments. remember, forgive yourself, and don't let any stumbles make you feel like everything is lost."

anxiety,depression,645,like i hate it for two reasons because first of all it either emasculating or infantilising. and second it implies that im not doing my best or at the least not trying or sometimes it comes off as someone making light of my feelings.
anxiety,ptsd,647,"to save you a google search, depersonalization is when a person feels like they are detached from themselves and they are seeing life almost as if they are in a dream. basically, they are very spaced out all the time. i work retail at the moment and while i'm working, i'm almost always either really nervous/anxious or in this dream-like state of mind. i'm so sick of it, man. edit: i don't know why but when i made my title i must've capitalized is and probably on accident. ignore that please, lol."
bipolar,depression,650,"i've been depressed for two months now, and panic attacks and prolonged crying jags from this week that have left me very depleted. this time around i'm feeling just so isolated. all of my close friends are in relationships, so they don't have much time to give me extra support. i understand that i can't be a priority for my friends and family all of the time, but a text checking that i'm ok every once in a while would go a long wacticing piano and reading, and today i even cooked for myself; but i'm just so tired. life is gray right now and it's hard, and trying to bring myself out of this depression feels almost impossible. i know it'll pass...i'm just not sure when, and waiting for it to lift is painful. i want my life back, dammit. sorry for the length and self-pitying nature of this post; i just needed to get this off my chest. thanks for reading &lt;3"

bipolar,depression,686,"my parents aren't bad people, but i don't think they've tried to understand my situation. they seem to just view me as lazy and workshy, because i have been able to do other things, like go across the country getting jobs, and making plans to start on courses and work full time at the same time, and this past weekend i went scuba diving, but i've struggled to find work, and i just left the job i only started last week. maybe they've got their minds stuck on depression and thinking i should be bed bound and unable to do anything, but in reality i have been doing much better since i got sober, and i'm building up to a normal level, i just wasn't ready ford work, but i'm not expecting that to happen. i'm in a grim sort of limbo, i just want to hide in my bed, because i can't stand the way my parents are viewing me right now. i started crying about it all this morning in public, not the actions of a mentally sound person. edit: well getting books in the hope my parents would read them has turned into them yelling at me and one saying they don't want to know, the other saying they've been through it, which he hasn't, not properly clinical depression as far as i know (and i did ask previously about family history) and certainly not bipolar. i'm going to just hide here in my room now. i feel pretty unwelcome."
bipolar,adhd,690,"someone reminded me the other day that there’s no cure for this disorder. as someone with a family history of it and someone who has been struggling with it most of my life, i objectively knew that, but i realized that this whole time i’ve been trying to change my medicine for almost a year, my mind has been hopeful for a cure. i have been wanting to cure it, not treat it, but actually be rid of it forever. wow. remembering that there’s no cure really hurts a lot and makes me kinda hopeless."
anxiety,depression,694,"i feel alone and useless unless i'm high or drunk. i might be failing classes at this point, or at least close to, but i can't go to class unless i'm on something without feeling like i want to kill myself or just give up completely. i'm even high right now, i haven't been sober in over a week."
adhd,anxiety,712,"the two are actually quite similar, so i would definitely take a look to make sure that you are going down the right path. it is also called ""emotional dysregulation disorder"" and it includes impulsivity, trouble concence of a 3-year-old, and you lack object constancy. so basically, you are constantly suspicious and worried about a close person's emotions changing when they aren't constantly talking to you or directly in your area."

ptsd,depression,716,i've had them for several years and i'm passed getting suicidal/etc but it just gets really hard to breath and always ends up disabling me for a good few hours. obviously i know what's happening and that it will pass but i just need advice that will help it pass faster. i have 2 jobs and they are setting me back time wise so much and i'm just really frustrated.
bipolar,depression,718,i just wanted to take a moment to brag about my husband. i came down and now i’m depressed. i’m crying for no reason. i can’t think because of the fog. my hen he gets home. he made me tea the other night when it was cold. i’m lucky to have him because we got married before my onset. he didn’t sign up for this.
bipolar,depression,719,"last week i wore my hair up everyday to work. not because i particularly like the way it looks, but because i couldn’t will myself the effort to take a shower for 5 days. wearing my “depression” hoodie that is 3 sizes too big, just so i can ignore my weight issue and have it’s dog hair covered fabric drape around my already dirty pajama shirt that i wore the last 4 nights. being this kind of sad is funny that way even something as mundane and rudimentary as doing my laundry takes more effort f glitter about to explode taking shots at the bar with my friends and oversharing too much with too many people this happiness turns agitated and irritable every small inconvenience feels like i might just turn green, sprout some brown shorts and call myself hulk like a rubber band that is twisting tighter and tighter until it snaps. and cuts my arm with an exacto knife and down i fall again… when people ask me how i am they should just ask me who i am today and what does my laundry look like"
ptsd,anxiety,729,"the other day i or i should say we went on a 1st date with a woman i had just met a couple of days earlier. i say we, because my service dog was with me. after we had eaten, we were just chatting n't remember driving home. i just couldn't think straight. i was short of breath. my heart was pounding. it had been such an amazing date up until that point. has anyone been thru anything similar?"

adhd,anxiety,735,"i was lucky enough to be able to give it a shot because i moved into my dorm today. i packed 3 boxes and 2 were under-packed. i basically asked myself what the bare essentials were. things that i had duplicates of. things i could do without. for example, i decided not to bring my christmas lights because, although i like dim lights, my desk lamp pointed at the wall gives an identical ambient *stuff* but now i know where everything is. i can drop my keys on the counter and find them easily and not worry about knocking other things off. it's great.i want my keys, i glance at the counter and they're *right there* no other distracting stimuli, just keys. i feel so calm and in control. i can focus on other things besides wasting mental energy filtering out all that unnecessary stimuli."
adhd,anxiety,737,"...and yet, everytime i want to cool a warm soda/beer i'm 100% sure that this time i will remember it. ironically, i still look for a place to put it (subconsciously) where the cleaning wouldn't take too long. i guess that's how my coping mechanisms work..."

anxiety,depression,740,"i love to grow flowers, it's pretty much my only hobby and the main way that i de-stress. i have flower beds all around my house and i view my plants as my ""babies."" but last year my emotional support cat passed away at 12 years old and i feel like my soul went with him, it was thet getting nervous and going back inside. now my beloved garden has its life back, and i feel a little bit better. now that i have new things popping up from the ground i have no excuse to ignore them. i hope i can muster up the strength to keep going. for today, i'm proud of myself."
depression,bipolar,755,"now that i've struggles with this bullshit for 7 years, i've come to the realisation that literally no one cares no one is genuinely there for you. everyone will claim to be there for you and beg you to open up to them because they want to be the hero who 'saves'd because you just can't quite bring yourself to talk to people. going through days of mania followed by weeks of lowness and having people expect you to be okay because of those few days of mania everyone wants to be there for you until you actually show symptoms"
adhd,bipolar,757,meaning you get a sudden clarity of how differently you behave while medicated. i had realized how helpful the medication is when i forgot to take it one day and it was a massive cluster fuck

adhd,ptsd,764,"hey everyone, can we talk about a serious topic for a moment? i want to hear the community's experience on masturbation and medication. **is anybody else experiencing porn addiction or extremely long fap sessions that are hard to stop early?** --- my story: i've always had some elements of porn &amp; masturbation addiction but it never got out of hand (pun intended) nor did it ever affect my life. i wouldn't have  way to overcome it or mitigate it, but failed. this week i've started nofap since my own personal measures didn't work. if i can't fix it myself by the next time i see my psych, it's too serious for me not to tell him about all this. --- **am i the only one that experiences this? do you guys have any similar experiences?** thank you for your thoughts or anything at all. i just ask that you keep it serious. thanks."

(i have medicaid) to get sleeping pills that actually work because she wouldn't return my call after giving my trazedone, which doesn't even work. i'm so angry at everyone. even my therapist who i told my problem to, i don't think he takes me seriously. i'm so tired."
adhd,depression,778,"and told her i don’t even remember what people who talked to me minutes ago were wearing. i almost never do. clothes are boring. idgaf about clothes. if you give me thousands of subjects to spend time thinking about, clothes would be like the last one. is it serious that people care so much about small physical details? i can’t believe it."

bipolar,depression,934,"yesterday was rough. i broke things off with my ex the day before yesterday due to some toxic and manipulative behavior. he freaked out on me and has been sending me messages on every app possible saying some of the most horrible things imaginable up until yesterday evening when i blocked him on everything possible. we we're dating for 6 years and i feel so fucking dumb. it was obvious he was trying to hurt me and he didn't, but he den i said i didn't want to hang again he tried to blame me for his actions so i blocked him too. i think i'm ok emotionally, but what the fuck? idk why i keep attracting people like this. i just don't understand and i'm so sick of it. i'm a sweet person and i don't feel like i deserve it. anyway, i just wanted to vent about my fucking horrible day yesterday. it was a scary day. as always, you guys are wonderful people and thank you :)"
adhd,ptsd,935,"any time i manage to get to the doctor and get my prescription filled before i run out of pills i have this sense like i just dodged this enormous freight train of life mangling destruction. the pharmacy i use is attached to a grocery store so for some reason the i imagine the train dressed like strange danger and its waiting for me in the cookies isle. not much else to say, just felt like sharing."
adhd,anxiety,939,wake up. be anxious about something. forget to do something. lose something. someone asks me to do something. forget. fail. be reminded of something else i forgot about a few months ago. over-react. someone at work says something. over-analyse it. fixate on it. was it a joke? every joke has an element of truth in it. become hyper-sensitive. nearly break down into tears. debate suicide. wonder why my referral is taking so fucking long.
adhd,bipolar,945,today i almost feel like... manic? i don't want to minimize what it's like to have an actual manic episode but goodness gracious my mind is racing. and i cannot focus on anything and feel like need to do something crazy. (more than i usually do hahaha)
ptsd,anxiety,946,"hello, i just got a weighted blanket and was trying it for a month to help me sleep. i was sleeping amazing with it for 2 weeks, (i'm 5'9, weigh 140lbs, male 27 year old just fyi) but then started getting a pain in my chest when i was sleeping. i was loving the blanket so much i just ignored the pain hoping it would go away. it kinda comes and goes. i t it was horrible. i basically need the weighted blanket now, i can tell i am addicted to it, but i need to find some way to avoid the chest pain. could a lighter blanket be better? i'm also going to try having it only on my legs and feet tonight. maybe that could work. brainstorming, thanks for reading this and if you have advice it would be appreciated."
bipolar,depression,947,"like many of you, when i get depressed i tend to stay in my room, unshowered, and pass the days bingeing on netflix, hulu or amazon prime. i canceled netflix so i could afford movie pass. (i'm on a fixed income.) it's a subscription service that allows you to see one movie a day, every day, for $10 a month. (this is not an advertisement, just an idea. i don't work for movie pass.) i spoke to my private showing. so maybe if you're like me and love movies, a subscription service may be the thing to help you leave the house. amc theaters also has a subscription service for $20 a month if you can afford that. (this is in the us). sinema has plans starting at $4.99 a month. if you love movies and want to have a motivation to leave the house once in a while, this may be a good idea for you."
anxiety,depression,948,"i just saw a motivational speech tonight. the speech was fine, good advice, well written. but i left it feeling so hopeless and almost in tears. here's this guy who's wealthy, driven, positive, and fit as fuck. i'm struggling to work ou i feel like a fucking negative nancy and that by not fixing that *right now,* i'm sabotaging my own life. i don't feel motivated right now. i sort of want to curl up into a ball. does anyone else react this way to motivational speeches?"
adhd,depression,951,"for anyone suffering and on the fence about it, give it even more serious thought. also this might be a bit of an overreaction seeing as its just the first fucking day but if this is how things are normally going to be then yeah; i should have done this ages ago. when i went on academic probation after my first year of college my mother told me that i should consider going back on it and would pay for it. i declined; citing that i did not want to be on the medication for my whole life and that i didn't want my success to be thanks to a pill. prideful. i did not want to be seen as ""weak"" needing medication just to focus on things that people did so easily. fast forward almost two years. i got my associates at a community college, but barely. my gpa was just a hair below 2.5, preventing me from transferring. i did land a job that paid well and i enjoyed. i had it for a year before hitting 3 strikes and being let go. 1st strike was because i went to fast and didn't double check something. 2nd strike was honestly just me not clocking in during the window before shift started. several of these tardies were over because i would get carried away talking to my co-workers about what needed to be done before shift (i had an odd job and this was required. i showed up 10-15 minutes early each shift). i would clock in after the buzzer rang, reminding me. 3rd strike was because of repeated problems in just failing to do certain things after being told to so. if i didn't writeted*. like the world is open to me now. literally every teacher i've had has mentioned that i should be doing a lot better than i am right now. every employer has praised my skills and work ethic but bemoaned on how i might solve problems other can't, but stumble on the simple things we do every day. today is a turning point. things will not be the same. the world had better watch out, because i don't think its prepared for /u/replieswithanimegif on medication. thank you to /r/adhd, and your wiki in particular. reading through the wiki was an eye opening experience that convinced me that i wasn't weak/broken/whatever. i had an issue. there was a solution. i realized that i was what i criticized often; someone refusing to acknowledge the answer when its staring right in front of them. thank you for helping me confront my pride and shove the answer in their face. tl;dr /r/adhd wiki is amazing. after two years of getting very little done academically and losing my job over add issues i've finally swallowed what to me was a bitter pill. if today is any indication, this is the beginning of major beneficial change. for the first time in a long time, i'm going to go to sleep without the thought of all the things i didn't get done tormenting me and making me feel inadequate. at least if adderall doesn't fuck up my sleep too much since i took it at like 1pm. thankfully my old job had me up till 12am anyways and i often don't get to sleep until 2 or 3am. here goes nothing."
none,anxiety,955,"my mother has had joint pain for quite sometime, and now it has escalated to a very different level where she can't even walk and she has been on the bed for past 6 months. i'm from a small towm called jamshedpur/ tatanagar and we have gone to almost every doctor and tried all their methods but no improvement has shown, infact by taking soo many high power medicinn really help her unlike the doctor's in my city.. so what places/hospital/finance schemes are my option? if the treatment to it is high we cannot afford it.... what to do guys. i'm really desperate and really i cannot see my mother suffer every minute of everyday... i tried to say this as openly as possible but i know i don't know the best words to describe it...."
bipolar,depression,959,"so in the title, within quotation marks, are what i've heard from people i spent the most time with. 1) my mom, 2) a now-ex boyfriend, and 3) a former friend. 1) my mom kinda blew up in the parking lot of a hospital. the doctor said i didn't need a cough pill for my infection, and would be fine with only the prescription she gave me, and then my mom asked if she could prescribe me with a cough syrup. the doctor agreed to prescribe a strong cough syrup, and i asked if i don't need a cough pill, ""do i need cough syrup?"" the doctor said no, but said ""the medicines won't react with one another,"" and ""if you want a cough syrup, i can prescribe one."" *but i don't.* my cough won't go away (respitory infection) until the steroids kick in, but it will go away. i don't like taking meds i don't need. i'm defensive about this, because every time i have respitory issues, my mom asks the doc for a cough syrup ""for my own good"" and i feel like shit bc it's got some depressive drug in it, and i feel ultra sluggish the morning after i take it. i don't need it so i'm adverse to taking it. my mom says it's ridiculous that i have a cough and won't take a cough syrup, when no cough syrup was prescribed or suggested. the steroids will take it's course. but mothers will be mothers. i just hate taking drugs i don't actually need. (and i'm 18 so i'd think the doctor would have asked me first. guess not.) anyway she called me ungrateful and wouldn't let me speak and i dunno. it hit me. she said: ""i'm better off dead than i am alive to you, because nothing i do as your mother makes you happy."" i wanted to shoot myself in the mouth right there and then, ngl. i know that isn't the (logical) answer to this, but she isn't the only one who's said stuff like this. 2) my ldr boyfriend of two years broke up with me last night. he says he doesn't feel like he can talk to me, because he says offhanded things, and for a while, i didn't address them until months later (which is toxic). and now he feels that he'll fuck up no matter what he does, so what's the point. in the past i've addressed things as they came up and he either made fun of me, got super defensive, or asked ""so what's the problem?"". for example: he didn't speak to me for long periods of time. for like. a year. cancelled majority of skype dates at the last second. i said that i knew he has other obligations, but that still felt a bit emotionally neglected. (being left on read for days and sometimes weeks, not hearing from him for months, reading an ""i love you, too"" from him was rare. i felt like he didn't like me.) but he said that i had no reason to believe that. he had a roommate who made me cry, and he didn't defend me. even if i say that i didn't appreciate a comment, he would just join him. of course, he didn't mean to be rude, and of course he didn't mean to overlook my crying, didn't mean to misunderstand me. but he refused to buy earbuds because of his ""indispoable income"" (even if he went out to drink once a month). which gave his roommate ammo to be a bully. so i mailed my then-bf earbuds and he lost them. it felt as if he didn't put any effort into the relationship, and was justifying himself. when i asked if he wanted to break up, he sounded surprised and confused as to why. said that he loves me. i wasn't angry, just hurt and confused with all the mixed messages. but i said i believed him and ignored my gut. plus, on holidays, he drives six hundred miles in one go to visit me (and his family. so contrary to what he says, i'm not the only reason he comes to the city i live in.) but he said ""you think i wanna see my family? barely anyone there wants to see me. i'm driving for nine hours straight just so see you. of course i love you."" he gave multiple examples of his responsibilities, asked if i understood, and still asked what the problem is. i couldn't teents to me and to other people. i understand how depression can be; but that doesn't excuse her from being mean. from playing rough and with scissors (as a seventeen year old). from going out of her way to patronize people. but she put on her snapchat story her suicidal thoughts, talking about how everyone she knows is against her. so i swiped up, let her know that i apologize if i wronged her, and that i want her to be okay. that i don't think anyone is against her. that i am here if she needs to talk. she said that i can't make her pity me, and i was baffled. that she doesn't have the energy for my bullshit. (yikes.) that i shouldn't play nice if i don't feel nicely about a person. (still don't know what's she was talking about but it was childish. but still yikes.) and then she said all i do is complain about my family problems and boyfriend and do nothing to fix it. (that was when i said ""good to know,"" and blocked her. hehe.) it's so funny that she *asked me* what's wrong, didn't accept ""nothing"" for an answer, and then secretly hated when i was open and honest. i thought she was my friend. but i guess only therapists are meant to hear your problems. anyway. i digress. days after i blocked her, she came around me in person. went out of her way to sit next to me. acted fearful, as if i would reject her. took every single chance she got to be overly nice. for example: i was presenting and the class (of 13 people) was talking over me. she stood up, cupped both hands over her mouth, and projected: ""everyone! chris is talking! it is important to hear what they say, so that they can finish their presentation!"" sat down, then grinned at me. the class had the same weirded-out expression as i did. like. ugh. that was so artificial that it hurt me. i have a floridan friend who i tell some of these situations with, and he says it sounds like the other person has some unsolved problems of their own. my therapist said the same thing about all three scenarios. that nothing i complain about is like. ""i'm so sad my dad got me a blue car. i wanted a red one."" y'know? like the problems that bother me are literally ""so i'm homeless and don't know where i'm sleeping tonight "" or ""i got 27 spider bites in my sleep"" or ""my mom is threatening to kick me out and i'm an unemployed student"" or something that can't be given advice, because it's totally out of anyone's control. like when my car got totalled and i kept having flashbacks about the crash throughout the day. i couldn't sleep at night. for weeks. or when three of my classmates died. or when i was in a sexually abusive relationship for six months, got assaulted everyday on school grounds, and didn't tell anyone for eight months. i have flashbacks and awful dreams about *that* one to this day. but i don't say anything until someone asks me what's wrong. and even if they do, i'm reluctant to say so. bc none of this can be hugged better. it's heavy. it's uncomfortable and nobody wants to hear it. those are the only things that get to me. those are the things i go to therapy for. but my therapist doesn't believe in dwelling on (talking about) past traumas and griefs. i don't know what anyone wants me to do anymore. do i just let go of *everything*? i do not exagerrate; these things happened in the same twelve months. i'm not trying to excuse my complaints, but, yikes. i don't know what to make of any of this. anyway. tldr: nobody i open up to stick around. are all of these situations like. situations where both parties have made acceptable mistakes in handling their situation? or am i this unhappy person who makes people miserable because i complain so much? am i ungrateful? am i being crazy for saying the things i do? does anyone else hear statements like these from people who see you the most? it's times like these that makes self destructive behavior so easy."
bipolar,anxiety,960,"monthly appointment with my doctor again. so i was a little worried about feeling this weird ""not caring"" on some things that i usually do. so i brought it up when he asked, is there anything you want to bring out? i told himed, that's the issue, i don't know. i'm not sure if it is good or bad. i said maybe imm just tired of being stressed. he smiled and i was surprised when he said, then it's good that you are becoming resilient to daily stress."
bipolar,depression,975,"i was recently pming with someone about relationships, heartbreak, and feeling broken and picked up on a shared sentiment. that our mental illnesses made us less deserving of love from healthy people. which my rational mind tells me is total bullshit, but it's still a sentiment i have to put effort into rejecting. it's no secret i've been investing serious time into online dating, but i think it's progress on my part that most of the time i don't feel like my mental illness disqualifies me from relationships with healthy people. i still feel like i'll be better understood by people who experience depression and whatnot and like my issues will be less of a burden to someone with their own struggles for me to give back to, but as i was thinking abouto more broken than any ""normie."" *how many of you have struggled to feel like it's okay to have relationships with healthy people, and of those of you who have, what if anything has helped you chip away at that feeling?* as broken as i've felt and as flawed as i've been, i've never been broken and i've never stopped being worth loving. there have been things about me that have made it harder to love me, like my former bmi of nearly 40 as a barrier to that kind of attracted attention, but even then i was sometimes shown that kind of love. **however broken you may feel and however unlovable you may feel, you are most certainly mistaken. you are complete and just as flawed as everyone else and worthy of love, however hard it may be to find that love.**"
bipolar,anxiety,976,"i started new meds a few weeks ago, and i think i found a good combination that works for me. i don't wake up wishing i was dead, i don't get irritable as much and i can go out in public without becoming super anxious. it's been harder to fall asleep and i have a few other small side effects, but they're not terrible. it's just nice to not be in a terrible mood 24/7. i hope others can find medications that work for them too!"
anxiety,depression,977,"tomorrow i bury my best friend who tragically passed away at the age of 25. i'm heartbroken and i will be speaking at his funeral. i am happy with the speech but i am nervous, petrified to mess up. he was an incredible guy and i want to send him off well, justify what he meant to me. my ex who broke up with me 2 months ago has kept contact to ask how i have been doing and if i ever needed anything go to her. i went to the gym yesterday evening just to pass the time and maybe work off a small hangover i was nursing from the night before. i felt okay but by the end of my session i was very tired. as i was walking back towards my flat i spot my ex with a guy next to her sitting down. i could have turned around but i didn't. i go up to her and say hi, she seems shocked to see me and asks if i'm doing okay. i say no, not really and say i'll leave them to it and say goodbye. as i walk down the road my ex has caught up with me after she runs to catch up with me. she says she has done this to tell me thatuy who has a family that makes her laugh, feel alive. this guy has a child. i recognise him from her xmas party. i'm really confused about why she chased after me. it's obvious she cares but is she feeling guilty, trying to spare my feelings in the hardest time of my life. i do want her back in my life but seeing her with another guy hurt big time. seeing them close to each other eating ice cream. she works with him, did she like him when we were dating. i also hate the idea of her sharing her sympathy and support with other people, especially a guy like that. and it hurts to hear her say to me he's going through a hard time. i'm going through the hardest time of my life. i feel like i can't use her as a crutch. i'm so confused, hurt, a mess. i bury my best friend tomorrow . i am absolutely terrified. i feel sick, like i'm going to mess up and ruin everything. the last 2 months has been the worst of my life, it just has. i want things to be better. i want him back. i want her back. i feel terrible."
ptsd,anxiety,978,"so long story short, recently i’ve been noticing i have more stomach troubles. vomiting, diarrhea, etc. yesterday i had another “stomach bug” but i noticed as soona man had gotten too close to me and i almost threw up in my car on the way home. does anyone else experience this? is this something i should tell my psychiatrist?"
anxiety,bipolar,985,"i got an offer!!!!!! i went back to pessimism and expecting the worst after a few days of not hearing back, but i did today, and they offered me the job!!!!! higher pay, almost double the pto, amazing behing!! thank you so so so much to everyone that gave such kind words of support and encouragement. this has been a huge life changing step for me and it’s amazing to be able to share it with all of y’all."
anxiety,depression,987,"i think about death all the time. everything i do at this point i ask myself why? it won't matter when i'm dead. i keep thinking how i could die tonight, to tomorrow or in my 20's or in my 40's or just go into cardiac arrest before i finish posting this. what if i'm dead before this year ends? what if i'm dead before i meet a girl, or have kids, or hell what if i die before the next time i get to eat a steak or smoke a cigar. does anyone else have this? if so how do you cope? thanks. and sorry if i rambled."

bipolar,ptsd,993,"so i've been diagnosed and medicated for almost two years now. for the first year i had a tough time with the meds (seroquel, depakote, zoloft, lamictal), so i blamed my shitty memory on that. but now i've gotten past all sidf y'all have any experience with this? one theory i have is drinking. i just started drinking 1-2 beers a day a few weeks ago, which correlates to when my problems have intensified...but 1-2 beers? doesn't seem like much. idk."

adhd,depression,1000,thank you to this [wonderful who went waaaay out of their way to try and hurt my feelings but ended up turning a bad day into a good one because it reminded me that some people have it worse. there are people out there who only feel good when they make others feel bad and those are the people to feel truly sorry for. i'm so flattered that they saw me as a target :)
anxiety,bipolar,1001,"so in my bigger lecture classes, i generally keep to myself and the classes are so big that it doesn't make much of a difference. smaller classes i would stress out a lot more about it but in bigger classes, i just have my misophonia to worry about. but yesterday, my class got moved anminutes before class starts! i've never had such a lovely conversation with a stranger so easily, and we connected on a lot of things. i don't know if i'll ever see her again because the class is so big, but i was just happy to have someone to talk to and this has never happened before."
adhd,bipolar,1023,so tonight i was setting out my meds for tomorrow morning on my napkin while drinking a cup of water and i..... you guessed it...... took my meds. i tried to f so yeah.... i have to wake up in 3 hours and 20 minutes and i am nowhere near tired. &amp;#x200b; tl;dr don't drink anything while setting out your meds my guy
adhd,depression,1039,"am i the only one that waste days effortlessly? like, i can plan a whole day but never do anything. i cycle through snap, ig, and youtube and get nothing done. when i do get urges to do something it’s 2/3 am but that would waste my mornings. so what do i do? i legit can’t get anything done and i hate it. people i care about look down on me and i feel worthless. i know people move at different paces to reach like goals but i don’t feel like i’m moving if i do absolutely nothing."
bipolar,depression,1042,"i have been off my meds and not seen my docs in a while. i know things are bad, you have read my posts. last night, i finally accepted i need help now. i am reaching out to all thiyback. when i get out, i will have no where to live, no belongings. that is my problem, no money, no family. the fear when i get out and being homeless is what is killing me inside."
none,ptsd,1045,"scientists are part of our culture, we aren't some separate class of people that have special immunity of irrational behavior. one of the cultural issues that the practice of science is not immune from is implicit bias, a subconscious aspect of racism. this isn't something we think about, it is in the fabric of how we conduct ourselves and what we expect of others, and it can have an enormous effect on opportunities for individuals. tomorrow, we will have a panel of people who have studied the issues and who have personally dealt with them in their lives as scientists.  them, how to recognize them in yourself and others. please ask questions (in a civil manner of course!) we want you to learn. as for those who would reject a difficult conversation (rejecting others is always easier than looking at your own behavior), i would caution that we will not tolerate racist, rude or otherwise unacceptable behavior. one can disagree without being disagreeable. lastly, thank you to all of our readers, commenters and verified users who make /r/science a quality subreddit that continues to offer unique insights into the institution we call science."

adhd,depression,1070,"it took me a year and a half to *finally* get diagnosed and start treatment for something i’ve had for 18+ years of my life. i have to go through a really inconvenient process to get my medication. i have to call my psychiatrist, pray to god he’s in the office, get a new prescription every time, drive 40 minutes out of my way to get a paper copy of my prescription, bring it to the pharmacy and wait another 30 minutes while they process it, ano give you my medication that i *need* just because you’re *actually* just lazy and/or want to get high. buy it from someone else. don’t take advantage of my kindness and my mental illness. you are the reason why it took me a year and a half to get diagnosed. you are the reason we don’t get taken seriously. you are the reason why some people think i’m just some junkie. you are the problem. rant over. ugh. sorry. i had to get that off my chest."

depression,bipolar,1092,"i'm an 18(m) who has sporadic depressive episodes. i've told some of my friends both indirectly and explicitly. and i always regret it. i hate the way they feel like they are treading on thin ice around me, but then i clearly desire attention if i told them in the first place. i've tried saying it to close friends (mostly when drunk) and also tried using fairly obvious forms of art as well. whatever i do, whoever i talk to, i wish i just stayed on my own. probably going to end up regretting this aswell."
anxiety,ptsd,1095,"my doctor and counselor have me listed as extreme anxiety and depression, early childhood ptsd, bi polar, borderline personality disorder. it's a relief to have an answer to what my problems are. this has been an on going problem my whole adult life. my first job, i had reasons for being depressed. i dropped out of school, parents were divorcing and i didn't have a stable housing situation, i was falling behind and depressed, full of anger and anxiety. i didn't want to call myself weak though and admit i had a problem, so i attempted to self medicate by escaping reality. i skateboarded, played video games, drank, smoked weed, partied, did everything i could to feel numb. 5 years later, because i didn't seek help or medication early on, i was put on suicide watch due to my new medications not worki application. my point to all this is i would be homeless and probably dead without her. she has saved my ass countless times over the years,having a mental illness makes holding a job so fucking difficult, i've lost at least 6 jobs since being with her. i have nothing but respect and love for her to be putting up with all this, while we are both still fairly young (i'm 24, she's 21 later this year) i wish her parents understood mental illness, but it's kind of a taboo in her family so we keep things as vague as possible. i just hope that i get through to disability services and can make an income that way, to relieve some stress from her life. she put off school for me from the very beginning, the least i can do is help her get through school. sorry about the rant. i hope everyone has a great day."

anxiety,depression,1098,"so i am starting to venture out of the house after having a very hard time leaving my 2 floor walkup apartment for almost a year now. tonight i accomplished getting to my favorite bookstore which is just around the corner for the first time since last spring! and guess what? here's what happened: i didn't faint. i didn't die. i didn't let lightheadedness/dizziness/for my husband who is my soul mate and best friend! (couldn't have done it without him!) recently, i started pushing myself to get outside more and more every day. today was a major milestone! spoke to people on the street. got myself some gifts. felt like my ""old self"". super freaking refreshing. just wanted to share w y'all that there is hope for us and the world!"

anxiety,ptsd,1103,"i have this weird situation going on where nearly every morning now, after waking up around 3-4 a.m. i will be half-awake and trying to go back asleep, the problem is, that my mind is constantly telling me, your alarm is about to go off, yorning. i was dreaming that i woke up and checked my phone and a girl replied, so was replaying a scenario of what i was gonna text back, over, and over, and over again. i finally realized that it wasn't actually happening and woke myself up."

depression,anxiety,1114,you know the sound a plastic cup makes when you squeeze it too hard? when you are standing and talking to people and you look normal but you are trying so hard not twhite lines running down the side from where it bent. i feel like i am making the crackling noise and i am covered in white lines. it is stupid but it seemed fitting.
bipolar,anxiety,1117,i got a cat almost a month ago. i got him because cats have been shown to help with anxiety. his favorite thing to do was to lay on my chest and purr while knocking my phone out of my hand to have me pet him. i lookedour ago. i don't understand how life has given me this many hardships in my life and especially 2 days before my birthday. all i wanted to do was spend it with him. i really do not know what to do. i'm just really sad.

adhd,ptsd,1135,"apologies for the use of that word in this post, for those who might be sensitive to it. *edit again* copy/pasting a comment to another user: where i'm from people use it as a slur toward the autism community. i'm actually not even sure it's just where i'm from - i see it all over the internet too. i don't personally think they're synonymous but since i witness ""autistic"" and ""retarded"" being used in the same sentence by shitty people all the time, i only wanted to be clear that i don't feel the same way and that i don't want to hurt anyone with my post :( that's why i had previously written that i don't use that word, nor would i ever call someone that anywt. but when i argue with my boyfriend i can barely remember what i've just said...i can't always remember how the argument even started. i get really flustered and then that gets worse. all i seem to hear is ""you're wrong."" i'm not always good at getting across what i mean the first time, either. so in frustration last night, my boyfriend asked me ""are you retarded?"" and it honestly hurt me a bit. i know some of you have had people ask you that. you start giving the question some thought because you feel you can't do anything right, ever. i'm not sure why i'm making this post...just feeling down in general. fucks with me every time, when someone asks me that."
anxiety,depression,1137,"i feel like i've become a shit ton better as a person, but there are those nights that make me relive all those bad moments and i beat myself up so much that i get seriously messed up. what i wouldn't give to go back and do it all over the right way again..that way, i might've made better friends who would've lasted through maybe? or maybe these experiences, they've made me better as a person? they've shaped me? i dont know at this point."
depression,bipolar,1142,"nothing is wrong in particular in my life, i have a couple things that are kinda down. but nothing i can say should be making me have such a bad reaction to it. if you want to know, i ha find a new job. however i am finding myself thinking even worse than usual about cutting my throat open and bleeding to death. the image in my mind is quite graphic, more so than normal."
anxiety,depression,1145,"i came into this year in a good place after years of wading through shit. i was kicking ass at my job, i have sorted a long term medical problem, i achieved dreams this winter by freeride snowboarding a mountain. i came out as bi / genderfluid to my family and it went well. but this year since then has fucked me up. i haven't touched another human in three months. i've been single for 12 years. i happening again every day recently. i don't want to see any more fucking therapists any more i hate the idea of it. i can't go through reopening all that painful old stuff again i don't want to deal with this bullshit any more. i don't want to burden my family with this, i've put them through enough. fucking 2020. its a good job i don't have a gun because its sure looking like a way to escape recently."
depression,anxiety,1146,"everyday in high school i see people who can be engaged in certain classes and discussions out of what seems like interest. sometimes i see or hear about a student who went above and beyond on something. or, at the very least, i notice people who can do work and study for tests reasonably ahead of time. every time i see one of these things i feel jealous, sad, and sometimes almosly interested in any of them. college is coming next year, and i have no idea what i'm going to do, or if i even have the motivation to make it through. it's been difficult enough pretending like i care in high school. any kind of work is just a massive mental chore to get through. if it weren't for my massive anxiety and fear of falling out, i probably wouldn't get anything done."
ptsd,anxiety,1157,"i've been having more panic attacks triggered by loud, sharp sounds, including today where a neighbor's fire alarm put me so on edge and panic-attacky that even after some help from my partner i'm still having a little trouble sleeping. i'm really really tired of just coping, of just keeping sound and light o, but is there at least some way that i can feel better, that i can feel less anxiety, that i can exist without having so many of my coping methods? i mean, i also deal with anxiety for other reasons, and that also hasn't been getting better, but if i could at least take this on separately it would help a bit."
bipolar,anxiety,1158,"i'd been on a several month streak of not missing meds, but the night before last, i left a 20mg pill of latuda in the box by accident, so i only took 40mg. this meant that i had 6 hours of increasingly detailed intrusive thoughts about self harm/suicide while feeling absolutely terrible, before i took my night meds (pdoc is bringing me back up to 80mg latuda) and a xanax and went to sleep at 8pm. i feel great today - yesterday was apparently just from missing that small amount of latuda."
bipolar,ptsd,1162,"just wanted to share that i finally got myself together enough to book an appointment with the therapist. i kinda stopped going and kept putting it off (it's ok i'll go next month, etc.) three years later i find myself on the edge, i'm relieved to have made the call. wish me luck!"

ptsd,depression,1175,i eat my feelings. sometimes it's worse than others. at the moment i'm going through a bad patch and i cant stop the feeling of needing to eat. does anyone else go through this? i just want to feel less alone

adhd,ptsd,1182,"do you guys ever get stimulation overload where you just get really irritable with things touching you? i mostly notice this when i'm trying to fall asleep and am too hot, or when am dealing with an overly cuddly pet. i feel bad when it's an animal that doemy own body. sometimes my toes feel like thier sticking together, or my ribs aren't in the right spot when i'm laying down and i have to keep adjusting my posture. i know this stuff might seem weird if you don't experience it, but i'm guessing i'm not alone?"
adhd,ptsd,1184,"i just thought it was funny that drugs are doing the exact opposite of how these people are implying it in this situation. i tend to argue with a wall of text for something that barely matters for me, likely so i can get my talking fix and 'cause it's stimulating."

none,ptsd,1188,"yesterday, me and my girlfriend, both 22 were in my car waiting for my girlfriend's driver to come pick her up right in front of her college at around 2pm. while being there for just a few minutes, watching music videos on youtube and showing absolutely no pda (not even holding hands), a policeman arrives on his motorbike and in a very aggressive and threatening way demanded me to get outside with an obvious intention of arresting/ slapping(?) me. i repeatedly e told me to flee off. what's the right approach of dealing with such a scenario since i obviously don't want our names in any kind of police records, neither do i want to include our parents into this as her parents still don't know about us! neither do i wana get myself slapped in public for nothing wrong. could they just falsely blame us for anything petty and make a case out of it, as i'm well aware public obscenity is illegal. by the way, this was in delhi."
bipolar,depression,1194,"i've noticed a theme in my negative thoughts about myself in the last year has been a focus on this idea that i'm a failure. it's something i think all too many of you can relate to, and something i hereby challenge you to do with me. i'll do it in the comments so it doesn't overshadow your accomplishments (because i want to hear about them and be proud of you!) or turn into nk of other things i've done i can be proud of, and maybe it'll help us see some of the awesome things you've done in life that you might not appreciate for its level of awesomeness. so...what in life was hard for you that you managed to do anyway? what was something you did that's been hard for other people that wasn't hard for you? what've you worked at? stay awesome, folks."
adhd,bipolar,1216,something i see mentioned a lot in this sub is people mentioning thy carry their daily doses in pill containers on keychains instead of the prescription bottle. just wanted to remind everyone that these are controlled substances and illegal to carry without a prescription. i don charge. obviously this charge would be dismissed once you show proof of prescription but please keep this in mind. a good way to have proof on you at all times is to take a picture of your pill bottle each time you fill your prescription since you always have your phone on you.
anxiety,depression,1219,"**eating clean** this has had a huge impact on me. eat eggs, salad, chicken, salmon, brown rice. stop eating crap every day. you can still eat bad food, just eat less of it. make bad food the exception, not the rule. **exercising** try to get some kind of exercise in at least once ed** having something to work towards can often take your mind off the things that are worrying you. **less social media** spend less time on social media in general. go outside and enjoy the world! these may seem stupid and simple, but they have worked for me and i wanted to share."

ptsd,depression,1230,"cw: suicide, violence, law enforcement, child abuse... i cried on my way to work after i bought my coffee. i saw the sunrise and started crying because i thought about the people i couldn't save because i wasn't good enough, they won't get to live and see a sunrise. or enjoy a coffee in the morning. that hurt (i worked with certain organizations i can't name for obvious reasons tracking human traffickers for some context. anyone in law enforcement, or first responders probably know you can't save everyone no matt night too. i cried at home because i just needed to. i think i just needed a day but i had meetings. ive been feeling so helpless that i can't even bother to feed myself, ive lost so much weight. i think i want to die but i have friends that have committed suicide too. and i don't want to put my friends through the pain i felt. today was a bad day and i wanted to bitch about it, welcome to my shit show ladies and gentlemen. i'm weak now, i don't have any more mental fortitude left. i hope your day was better :)"
bipolar,anxiety,1238,"i’m in a good place in my life right now, and i finally found a good balance of medicine and therapy, etc. but i keep getting paranoid that people around me are going to wake up one day and dislike me or want to hurt me. i know that logically, mooughts or feelings, i’ve convinced myself that everyone has trouble with that. and that someday, they’ll all leave in the same way that i walked out of people’s lives in the past. it makes it really hard to form meaningful relationships sometimes."
ptsd,bipolar,1241,"i typed out a whole long vent post but then realized i really just wanted to know if anyone else had the same problem. my ex is the first out of many different guys who respected my boundaries and always made sure that our sex was fully consensual. we dated for a year, broke uherapy and that i will eventually find a man i can trust, although i am worried that i'll run into the wrong men before i find him. i'm just curious - how many of you have gotten too attached to people who treated you well after your diagnosis (or after you developed symptoms)?"
ptsd,anxiety,1248,"it’s ironic and frustrating, because i spend 99% of the time hyper-vigilant and on edge, but when i’m in a situation that actually could be dangerous, suddenly i beco that i shouldn’t have, and potentially seriously endangered myself. i never realize what happened until i look back on it afterwards and i feel like a complete idiot."
bipolar,depression,1253,"title says it all. i was bombarded this morning by my boss, essentially belittling me in front of the entire office. i sucked up like the man i am, and sat down behind my desk. and then it hit how that felt. i ran to the back half of the office, stood out in secluded section of the warehouse and wept. granted it was for only about 30 seconds, i haven't felt such relief in so long."

bipolar,ptsd,1270,"facebook seriously stresses me out. does anyone else struggle with social media? i have a hard time staying connected to friends and family because the things people post can be serious triggers for me. it doesn't matter if i'm upcycling or downcycling, something is bound to either agitate or depress me. sometimes i go on binges of unfollowing people. that doesn't help because then i don't have those connections and my feed fills up with promoted crap thaationships. i have my immediate family, and a couple of close friends (that's funny. i haven't seen them in literally a year and a half) but everyone else is an acquaintance at best. i don't even talk to my mother unless i have to, and that's after we've mended our relationship (as much as possible at this point). i'm not asking for advice, i just want to know that i'm not alone in feeling like this. do others have the same experiences? can you share some?"
bipolar,depression,1272,"i've been on disability for about three years now because of how frequently i cycle into either suicidal depression or debilitating mania. it always seems to sync up with whenever i'm t now, but i can't blame myself for when i think that way sometimes. i feel so guilty for being on medicaid/ssdi because it feels like i'm a parasite of society. can anyone here relate?"
bipolar,depression,1274,"so i have known for a long time i have suffered from depression and anxiety. i mean if you check my posts history you can see that. i find myself frequently depressed, to the point of wanting to just end things (however won't for a myriad of reasons). i also find myself anxious beyond belief about certain things. i was told for years that i had both depression and anxiety. nothing more, nothing less. i have had manic episodes, and when i am on go, i am on go, but i am good at looking stoic and being ""normal"" on the outside. if that makes sense? howevee down and given me exams or anything but has suggested it for years. my therapist even was on the boarder about it for a while. i am sure my mom has it too, albeit far more showing? so yeah, here we are! rather here i am in my early 30s and finally things click. however, it is scary. like i don't know what comes next? will this diagnosis impact my life negatively and adversely? will i have to disclose it, or hide it from my job? i don't know. it is ironically depressing in of it self. but we shall see what the future holds. anyway, thanks for reading!"

anxiety,none,1353,"felt horrible when i read the news, with the fears that many have about potential war. although i live in australia, i’m still scared about the outcomes. speaking to my dad, he reassures me this isn’t a global conflict (china and russia, and other major players being unlikely to join the war). nevertheless, i understand even a war between iran and the us wouldn’t impact me better (what i think my dad does at times, or others in other posts). the rational part of me tells me not to worry about this, as even if it eventuates to my worst fears, i’ll be worrying about it twice. with a pretty important interview in a couple of days, i’m trying to stick that, but not sure how i’ll cope as more news comes out (although i’m making myself keep off it)."
bipolar,none,1358,"i do at times. sometimes i will say ""the splu biders"" or ""tub bath"". reading is fine and easy, not dyslexic at all but the speech is weird. today i forget to take my meds, and found it to be worse than normal (with meds). anyone else experience this?"
ptsd,anxiety,1360,i was sitting at the kitchen table and my husband was standing over me trying to give me a high-five… he thrust his hand out so quickly at me i got triggered and started to tear up and breathe very heavily. now normally this is when i would either get really angry and defensive o notice... i asked him just now how he felt about me not spiraling into a panic attack and being able to come myself down this tim all he said was “ that was nice.” i needed to share with you guys because i have no one else in this world. for a moment i was really proud of myself.
bipolar,adhd,1361,"two months ago i went to my psychiatrist after being stable for a year and asked her for adderall. i made a total fool of myself. what i didn't realize is that i was on a downward spiral. all of my responsibilities have been unmanageable but i didn't realize it. slowly but surely, my mental health declined until it was affecting me physically. i was having acid reflux that was so severe it was making me told me she knew from experience that a person who has been stable asking for a control is a sign they're slipping. she said she knows how hard i work and it's understandable that i need a time out. my doctor gave me eight months, minimum. she will let me have up to 12 months if i need it. i'm going to use this time to completely overhaul my life and get help. it just feels so damn good to be validated."
bipolar,adhd,1362,i promised a friend i'd make a poster and a pin the tail on the donkey game for his kid's birthday. then i forgot - because my own kid had a school project that i threw all my free time this week into. i remembered thursday at work abofeel stupid for this. i also had a twelve hour work day yesterday and it's a job that requires tons of running. i hope they're happy with it all. if they're not... i guess i'll just have to accept that and know that i gave it my best!!!
adhd,depression,1365,"he observed that i’m always on my phone or reading or listening to music or watching television or working on something or (more often than not) some combination thereof. he’s never seen me sit and do nothing but think. my dude, my guy, i’m never not thinking. i wish my brain would just shut up every now and then. i’m always doing something because if i don’t direct that mental energy somehow, it turns into intrusive thoughts, anxiety, or self-destructive tendencies. stimulation is required."
bipolar,ptsd,1369,"i'm not sure where to even begin really. i've been trying to write out a post for a week. last wednesday i received a text from my other brother that simply said, ""a***** is dead."" it was most likely from pneumonia. though it is also possible he od'd on pain pills and/or commited suicide. he was 36. his death is awful in itself of course but it also brings up complex implications. he was 10 years older than i and we have never been close. he intensely hated me because he didn't believe that my aunt's husband(primary abuser) abused me throughout childhood. a was living in an apartment owned by my aunt and her husband across th for my mother. that was really hard. just stirring up more complicating feelings. seeing photos of us(siblings) young together. seeing photos of me with my aunt and my cousins. lots of photos from before the family split up. pictures of my aunt on her wedding day where she looks so and happy and beautiful. i'm not sure how i feel exactly. waves of grief and guilt i was already really depressed before this happened and had almost relapsed with sh. si was creeping up already again too. they are both increasing. i just want to drink and be numb. wishing hypomania would come life me up for just a little while. thanks for reading."
adhd,anxiety,1370,"i took my last one today, and luckily i can get the prescription one more time from the apothecary(?) before i need to have a doctor's appointment. (just a regular check) i have 4 exams in 2 weeks. having to wait for a doctor's appointment would have been horrible. tldr just check how much you have left, and that you are good until the next refill :d"
bipolar,depression,1378,she's still an infant and i'm already worried that she knows that mommy is going through the motions some days. i try to keep doing our regular activities but it is so hard to smile and look and act enthusiastic. i'm just so tired and sad and i'm not sure i'm giving her what she needs. i'd love to hear your advice and experiences.
anxiety,ptsd,1380,backlash or not keep those comments to yourself. unless you want to keep your account keep those fucking thoughts to yourself. had enough of seeing that shit today. it’s disgusting.
ptsd,anxiety,1384,"outside of my husband and my mother in law, i have no one. i work from home so, no coworkers. i go grocery shopping and can do things outside the house if i need to so it’s not severe social anxiety or agoraphobia. i can have a conversation and i’m pleasink about me, or know me. i’ve even told my husband that if i die before him, please don’t have a funeral for me because i don’t even want anyone to know i’ve died, if at all possible. anyone else find themselves totally and completely okay with solitude?"
ptsd,depression,1385,"i believe we are stronger than the demons we face. i know it’s hard and sometimes it seems impossible. but we all can do it. just keep fighting and keep your heads up. love you guys. stay strong, stay sane, stay alive!"
anxiety,depression,1387,"i think about this a little more than i should... and then i keep saying “you have nothing wrong with you! your parents were right, you’re just faking it for the attention! and then think about that until you cry? bothers me."
adhd,bipolar,1389,"i was just diagnosed last week (at 36 years old) and have been reading a lot, trying to understand this thing that i've unknowingly been battling for my entire life. this small section in the book driven to distraction by edward m. hallowell m.d. spoke to me so strongly i thought i would share in hopes that it might speak to others on the same path. it's a quote from one of his patients. &gt; “oh,” she answered, “that is about a cough drop someoneto greet me when i got into the car the next morning, jeff was with me. i looked at the cough drop and burst into tears. jeff asked me why i was crying, and i told him it was because of the cough drop. he thought i was losing my mind. ‘but you don’t understand,’ i said, ‘my whole life is like that. i see something that i mean to do and then i don’t do it. it’s not only trivial things like the cough drop; it’s big things, too.’ that is why i cried.”"
ptsd,depression,1394,"i feel completely trapped in my own head. i've had that ""chair is about to fall backward"" feeling day in and day out for like three weeks now. it's becoming exhausting. i feel like a thousand screaming emotions are trapped behind a stone exterior. i can't cry or yell or write. i can't express any emotions, even for moms most of the time, it's just particularly bad right now and trying to out-logic my emotions is just overwhelming sometimes. right now is one of those times. you guys are my people and i guess i'm not really looking for solutions, just someone to remind me that it will pass and maybe offer up some tips on self-care."
bipolar,depression,1397,"my soul mate. literally, the love of my life. we've only known each other for about a month &amp; a half but he has literally saved me. i never thought love at first sight was real until i met him. the day we met, i held him &amp; i just knew. &amp; i think he knew too. i am of course speaking about my handsome pup, dodger i've been so fucking miserable the last few weeks (psa: take your meds). i've been so depressed &amp; so miserable &amp; work has been fuckhed to the juul because of him. i just wanted to share because i tend to share the shitty things in relation to my mental health &amp; i wanted to share the positive. i wanted to share the reason i didn't end up in the hospital the last couple of weeks. i wanted to share the reason i finally want to live. &lt;3 fun fact: for any dickens fans out there, he is named after the artful dodger in oliver twist...because he is one of my favorite characters of all time."
none,ptsd,1401,"at 14 years old he saw his beloved grandma get shredded with bullets by the man he used to play with. at 21 his father was blown up by terrorists. he didnt even get to see his father's body one last time. deaths are never good. people always get hurt for life and some take a lifetimrage because when you take out the political figure out of him, he is a person who suffered too much too early in his life. something most of us will never or never did suffer in life. i dont support congress, but lets not insult or let neech aadmi's insult and hurt those soft spots."
depression,bipolar,1404,"i took a number of ssris during my last depressive episode and wellbutrin xl was the only one that made me flip into ""good days"" on occasion, however, would often slip back into depression after i went to sleep and woke up. i finally got out of my last depressive episode was flipped into a ""good day"" twice where i feel normal, energized, have my motivation back and feel like my old self. i tried to get angry and vowed to wake up to being feeling good, but sadly, the next morning i was back to a deep depression. has anyone else had this experience?"
bipolar,adhd,1408,"i am in grad school. i have two assignments to do before the end of the month and i'm not gonna do them. one was due dec 15, last year! accessibility services helped me get an extension to april 30. i haven't done any work on it. the anxiety is so high about it i'm not going to get it done. and i can't work on the other one, because then i'm not working on that one. i've sought help from accessibility services at school. i met with a learni the water. how many times do i get to ask for help? its not fair. i'm taking resources from the people who ask for help and then actually make use of it. the cycle is just going to continue. depression, procrastinate, anxiety, depression, ask for extension, depression, procrastinate, anxiety, depression. i hate it. it doesn't stop. my thoughts keep arriving at the only way to make it all stop entirely. but i don't want that. i don't think."
anxiety,depression,1419,"i made the call to a place to finally seek some help. i was honest with the lady on the phone and it felt good knowing that i (we!!!) are not alone in this!! i know i will not always feel like this and i hang on to that thought and for now, that's what is getting me through this tough time. may all who read this know that this too shall pass and if anyone needs someone to talk to, i am here to listen."
bipolar,depression,1422,"hello! i've had insomnia as early as age 7. at this point, my ability to fall and/or stay asleep is so difficult that i am taking sleep when i can. it's not the same as when you sleep a lot because you're depressed. it's just that if i feel sleepy at still able to maintain attendance at school and work. because of this, i've kinda rationalized sleeping this way. i've abided by all the sleep hygiene rules and still no cigar. so this is what i'm settling at. does anyone else do this or feel this way?"
anxiety,depression,1423,"i consistently talk to myself. sometimes i will sit down, and have conversations with myself. it's like a back and forth q&amp;a; as my mind wonders off about a curiosity, or unce""idiot"", ""stupid"", or ""loser"". in all honesty, i feel like i only call myself these names to motivate myself to do better next time. however, i'm not sure how helpful it really is."

anxiety,depression,1440,"seriously. a minute ago, i was shoveling food into my mouth. i felt like i had a billion things to do at the moment, even though in reality i had a lot of time to do those things. i felt light headed and my heart was rac change things up. (forgive me if this is an obvious lpt. it's certainly not new because i've been told it countless times, but i've often overlooked it. hopefully this will help those of you who overlooked it as i have.)"
ptsd,bipolar,1443,"title says it all. you wanna talk about things you’re experiencing, we all are open to hearing it. but none of us, no matter how long we’ve been in treatment, are certified professionals. we are here to support you. but if you truly want to know, you need to find a counselor and get the necessary testing done. please don’t take this personal. i honestly want everyone to get the help they need. and treatment has made me so much better. i hope you all find the answers you’re looking for."
anxiety,depression,1444,"i just noticed this a couple of days ago when i was messaging back and forth with my boyfriend the whole day. i had just finished volunteering at a crisis hotline and we we were talking about how i needed a recommendation letter from them for my social work degree program and he was saying ""it sounds like an intense program, but if anyone can do it it's my hat said ""he's going to break up with you way before that."" yesterday my boyfriend got way into this new game he got and he wasn't really paying attention to me or anyone or anything else really which just made more of those negative thoughts pop into my head like he doesn't love me. it was so bad that i couldn't sleep last night. i just need advice i guess."

anxiety,depression,1475,"the older i get, the worse i seem to be at, i don't know, functioning in general. i used to be really sociable, have plenty of friends, i did well in school, had hobbies and interests - i was weird, but enough people liked me that i didn't think about it. after high school it was like the blinders were taken off and i started to see all these things about myself that i really, really hated. i started struggling a lot in social situations, i flunked out of a really good university, i couldn't hold a job, i gradually lost contact with my friends... i was a mess. but i got back up. it was a little harder than before but i still had enough momentum to keep going. i moved back to my ollet myself become. i think a big part of my problems is that i'm so used to trying and failing that i'm afraid that's the only outcome if i try again. i look at myself and think ""i've given up,"" because i have. i don't want to! but i don't know how to make life work for me anymore. i don't know how to connect with people. i go out somewhere and it's impossible to think or talk clearly through the static in my head that makes me nauseous and stutter and my heart pound. what kind of a life is one where you can't even talk to someone without turning into an idiot or crying after? i can't function like this. i'll never be able to work like this. has anyone overcome a similar situation?"
bipolar,depression,1476,i simply couldn’t handle the monotony and soul crushing nature of an office job for myself....and while that may be true of being a dishwasher it’s at least more mind numbing. i feel like i failed societal expectations and my family’s as well by ending up this way but it truly is the disease. this happen to anyone else? were you able to find contentment in simpler work?
