bipolar,depression,3,"i didn't care to do anything this year. the only reason i bought a cake is because i have a six year old. the only reason i'm posting is because... those younger than me: you'll be 31 i am finally getting self discipline down and writing my books. i couldn't even imagine this all before. i've had the ups and downs but today, i am 31, and you'll get here one day, too."
anxiety,depression,4,i don't understand whats wrong with me. i don't know why i freak out sometimes. like right now i'm just laying in bed nothing is happening but i can't keep the tears running from down my face. it's stupid. i'm honestly fine nothing is wrong. why on earth am i like this?
adhd,bipolar,5,"i just want to fucking sit down and read this material for my essay, the deadlines tomorrow, it's really not that hard, i don't have any problems understanding it or anything, i should have done it much sooner, it is entirely physically possible for me to go over to my desk, sit down and just start reading the next thing on the reading list, but instead i'm just lying here in my bed, and it's just so horribly fucking frustrating."
ptsd,bipolar,14,"at 7:23pm my dad passed away five years ago today. i have been on edge all day. sneaking off to the walking fridge to cry when i don’t have too many tickets in the window. sunday’s are always hard because of brunch. staff and gu the blood/brain barrier. but his lab forced him to retire early and he took it personally. he made the test for aids/hiv, hepatitis a,b, and c, west nile, and chagas’ disease. i just want to tell him i love him one last time..."
ptsd,bipolar,16,"i (26f) don’t want to go into a lot of detail because i’m still processing everything. i had a psychotic break last week after a huge trigger. last wednesday i drove up to a cabin in the woods and swallowed a bunch of pills until the cops showed up, called by my parents after they tracked me down. they took me to the nearest hospital where i actually escaped then was brought back again by the police out looking for me. i’ve literally lost count of how many attempts i’ve made, but i know it’s in the 20 range. most of them occurred in a 3 month periodanything similar? how did you cope? maybe if i just hide in bed the rest of my life i’ll live to be 80. she said i can do it, but i need to realize the harsh truth of the matter that i have already beat the odds too many times. i feel unfixable. will i be broken forever? will i live until i’m 80? i really hope so, but now i’m not so sure. attempting suicide became a coping mechanism for me years ago but i thought after a year and a half of therapy i could go the rest of my life without an attempt. i don’t know what i’m looking for, any help i guess."
ptsd,bipolar,17,"i saw your post on weighted blankets and how it can help you sleep. it normally takes me over an hour to fall asleep and normally only sleep about 4-5 hours a night. i gave it a shot and bought a weighted blanket and for the past 2 weeks i have fallen asleep faster than my husband and sleep a glorious 7-8 hours straight. so thank you who ever posted that, because hat was what i clearly needed."
ptsd,depression,18,"i had a few very traumatic events happen to me over the course of about 3 years. as a result, i really don’t trust in anything or anyone anymore. i managed to get married and really do trust my partner, but not anyone else. i just moved across the country and i’m findien through to harm me. it gets really exhausting because i’m really lonely here since i don’t know anybody which exacerbates my depression. it’s like, i have the desire to try and make friends but what i’ve been through just won’t let me. it’s such an isolating feeling."
depression,anxiety,26,"when i was well i was pretty mentally healthy, could easily cope with everything, happy and successful. i had always been one of the smartest people in the class and at work. no anything else. how can a child possibly succeed at school if their home life is bad (i know it happens for some supper resilient kids) but for the majority, maybe not so much..."
bipolar,depression,27,"i was recently pming with someone about relationships, heartbreak, and feeling broken and picked up on a shared sentiment. that our mental illnesses made us less deserving of love from healthy people. which my rational mind tells me is total bullshit, but it's still a sentiment i have to put effort into rejecting. it's no secret i've been investing serious time into online dating, but i think it's progress on my part that most of the time i don't feel like my mental illness disqualifies me from relationships with healthy people. i still feel like i'll be better understood by people who experience depression and whatnot and like my issues will be less of a burden to someone with their own struggles for me to give back to, but as i was thinking abouto more broken than any ""normie."" *how many of you have struggled to feel like it's okay to have relationships with healthy people, and of those of you who have, what if anything has helped you chip away at that feeling?* as broken as i've felt and as flawed as i've been, i've never been broken and i've never stopped being worth loving. there have been things about me that have made it harder to love me, like my former bmi of nearly 40 as a barrier to that kind of attracted attention, but even then i was sometimes shown that kind of love. **however broken you may feel and however unlovable you may feel, you are most certainly mistaken. you are complete and just as flawed as everyone else and worthy of love, however hard it may be to find that love.**"
bipolar,none,30,"my pdoc told me yesterday that he‘s considering changing my dx from bp2 to rapid cycling. so i’ve been reading up on it and came across [this also found a heavier [paper thought i’d share since i find it pretty neat that there may be a correlation. i mean, how wild a concept is this: &gt; the nature of the mechanism that makes it possible for an object as small as the human body to be affected by the minute changes in gravity that are associated with lunar tidal cycles is unclear"
none,depression,31,"i am done with this shit. people are ugly bc. i decided to put some roti and sabzi next to this sleeping beggar on shivaji bridge station. didn't want to disturb his somber. this drunk uncle pats my back , goes ""bahund apologized to the beggar. one can't even be kind now. it broke my spirit man. i didn't want him to be kicked and beaten up like that. i feel horrible. this nation is going nowhere. maa chudao. i repeat maaa chudao."
anxiety,bipolar,32,"i mean, it’s pretty catch-all, hitting every note from personal catastrophic failure to an impending apocalypse. “well, it’d suck real bad if [blank] happened, but there’s always a rock to smash your own head in with!”"
none,depression,33,"especially for google play's music, most of it aggregates from youtube it seems. i find myself listening to live performances really often, which inherently isn't bad....i'm just not a fan of 30% of the song being audience cheers or people screaming over the musician's chorus. i know i could create my own playlists by hand, but sometimes i like to discover new artists. sorry for ranting. i wanted to get this off my chest while i go back to work."
bipolar,anxiety,34,"sorry for the rambling post. i just need a safe place to vent. i'm pretty much losing it. i haven't been to work all week because i'm crippled with anxiety and i've been super irritable, lashing out,t know if it will do much good as i know that when i get out i won't be able to afford the medication they'll put me on and i'll be back to square one. i'm sorry. i just feel so overwhelmed right now."
bipolar,anxiety,35,"i live with my family. we have different schedules so we don't see each other a lot. when we do, we get along okay, but they just don't understand me. it sounds super cliche but... we don't have a lot of the same things in common. they don't want to talk about the stuff i like to talk about, and on the off chance i do end up having a conversation about said things, i'm left feeling... ashamed? that's not the right word. kind of stupid, i gd the things i go through. and it's hard to find those kinds of people. i feel like the people around me are not on the same intellectual level as i am. not to say that they're stupid, because they're not, but our interests are just not the same. i need mental stimulation. i need adult conversation. i'm just here to vent, but is there anyone here who understands what i'm trying to say? i'm in my mid 20's, but i feel like an angsty teenager."
bipolar,ptsd,49,"so, how do handle therapy during episodes? last time i tried therapy i was in a mixed episode like the whole time, and you really could not convince me i was anything but the worst kind of person no mng one, and do you find it helpful at that time? i am going to try therapy again, and might need to discuss with my therapist at the start, like how i might have to adjust what we do depending on that."
bipolar,ptsd,50,"i’ve been on this thread a number of years (under different usernames) and it is generally a really nice, supportive place. but every time around this year there’s an uptick of aggression. funnily enough it coincides with when most people develop mania. it’s probably best to ignore and show some empathy as we’ve all said nasty things under episodes i’m sure."
none,depression,51,"it took nearly 3 years and countless fights, but last night he agreed that the current government feels more like a dictatorship, and it was a mistake voting for them in the general elections, and this coming froif you are facing the same situation at home. keep on making the rational arguments and tell them the facts. you'll get through. if anyone can change the minds of your parents, it's you. happy belated diwali guys!"
adhd,bipolar,54,"but i fucking did it y'all i wasn't late! i made it on time! i usually have to give myself like three hours in the morning to get ready because of how long it takes me, but i fucking hustled and i made in on time. i'm so proud of myself right now."
depression,anxiety,60,you know the sound a plastic cup makes when you squeeze it too hard? when you are standing and talking to people and you look normal but you are trying so hard not twhite lines running down the side from where it bent. i feel like i am making the crackling noise and i am covered in white lines. it is stupid but it seemed fitting.
none,ptsd,61,"i was recording the police while they were using same mouthpiece to check for *drinking under influence* during march. i felt that this is wrong to do while there is a contagious virus out there, you fucking don't know who's got it. one traffic cop sneaked up to me and held me while he called all his colleagues, 7-8 guys surrounding me. their leader screamed and yelled at much law exists and people know about it, it will make a significant difference because the police will have a sense of ""someone's watching me"" and could bring down police brutality. edit: deleted the video, it made me feel uncomfortable having it in my gallery. i had nightmares about how it could have gone more wrong, for a week. you know it's bad when police gives you ptsd."
depression,bipolar,62,i feel like shit mentally and physically and i'm terrified :( and all at the time when i have received horrible news.. edit: thank you everybody who has commented and whoever else might want to share their experience. every single one of you has alleviated my depressive thoughts and anxiety. thank you. i hope this post has done the same for some of you aswell.
ptsd,depression,66,i really need some support i’m feeling over the edge semi suicidal because i feel like i’m failing at everything. i can’t even make friends. maybe i am just a bad person. maybe everything my ex ever said was true. i just feel like such a failure and just have no enthusiasm to keep fighting. need some encouragement. i have no one.
adhd,bipolar,67,like seriously i've just been going through this subreddit reading post after post and i'm realizing so much of myself. it's like holy shit there's so many weirdon-adhd friends before and they don't really understand and just get confused. this shit's crazy man i mean my mind is just being opened up so much here like damn
ptsd,bipolar,69,"i find it hypocritical that i am sometimes called a crazy person or a freak when i tell others that i suffer from a mental disorder, while in fact, the entire world is like a planet sized mental institution with various levels of crazy. it's just that ... some forms of craziness are more acceptable than others i find it funny that the enitre world is full of crazy, and then people who are reading this os posting on this tread for help and compassion becuase we unfortunately have to through some pretty harsh and intense mental battles ... they have the luxury to call **us** crazy **edit** ... i'm sorry ... maybe crazy is too much of a strong word. maybe weird is better - we have plenty of academic fields which have their own levels of weirdness *(some of them are truly more weird than others with abstract theories and assumptions that some people still beleive like left-handed people are criminals or pathological people)* - on this year, we were shown what extreme measures some world leaders are willing to do to get what they want. discrimion - we are now, in some way, slaves of social media. wanting to post plenty, sometimes even, unnecessary posts to please others because we don't want to feel alone or rejected or even ostracized by others becuase of how the internet often involves a lot of clickbait and using it for drama or even discriminating or humiliating others becuase we simply can and then, when someone knows that i have to go through a variety of mental battles which have affected by a number of factors, could be social like my past experiences or could be biological like genetics or could be internal like a part of personality that making me act in neurotic ways ... .... but still ... i am the one who is treated as this so-called **""freak""** and probably the same treatment for many other people around the world. *(i'm sorry if this hurt you. i just wanted to get this out of my chest)* *(also, sorry if there are my grammatical errors ... i have no idea why but my mental disorders affects my language skills. i don't know why or how but it annoys me and i apologise)*"
depression,adhd,70,"anyone else? i have difficulty sometimes even answering a comment on my own threads (when i make them), and **this** thread took me 3 times to write, as did the last comment i made. :|"
anxiety,depression,76,"sounds conceited, but i am. and nobody to talk to about it. kids dad ended up getting a damn dui with our two kids in the car. 😡 cys (child protective services) ended up coming to my house to talk to me and the kids  and i didn't even cry. everything is fine now. it wasn't as hard as i thought it was! :,) to do something that makes me proud of me... im in a happy daze. now if only i can be brave enough to leave this post up.. lol"
adhd,bipolar,77,"i mean it was obviously an incredibly productive day. i had a good night's rest, meds, and caffeine on board for the potent triple-threat... that i failed to aim at schoolwork and cleaning the apartment. *balls.* at least i remembered to eat lunch."
depression,bipolar,78,i've been dealing with this long enough that i'm fairly certain things aren't going to get better. medication doesn't work. talk therapy doesn't work. hitting the gym doesn't work. getting degrees in psychology doesn't work. consulting expertn't really that helpful here. i just wanted to get the thoughts out of my head and articulate them to someone other than myself. please don't tell me to call a hotline and listen to some underpaid stranger try to convince me that i'm mistaken.
bipolar,depression,79,i simply couldn’t handle the monotony and soul crushing nature of an office job for myself....and while that may be true of being a dishwasher it’s at least more mind numbing. i feel like i failed societal expectations and my family’s as well by ending up this way but it truly is the disease. this happen to anyone else? were you able to find contentment in simpler work?
ptsd,anxiety,81,"like it says, something feels wrong. i can taste in my mouth that something isn't right. it's as if i'm looking at everything through a different light, like my mind is seperate  screamed throughout my head. i can feel in my chest that something is wrong, it's not anxiety, it's my heart pumping so loud. it feels like something very bad is about to happen."
anxiety,bipolar,82,"this should be a celebratory post but i've spent two days awake, shaking, throwing up or otherwise... i don't know if i can do it but i can't live the hell of staying in our 1 bedroom apartment any longer. i got hired at an oil and vinegar bar, and i really want to work there because i cook a lot and  shopped there i dreaded when the employees bombed me with information. so yeah, i work at 2 tomorrow expecting to not last the 2 week probation period. everything i'm studying just gets lost in my head and i retreat back to my no window bedroom calm down. but i can't lose my car or stay in this house."
anxiety,ptsd,87,"i’ve had the worst week of my life. pretty much lost the will to live. my anxiety has been at a all time high since i calmed it down a while ago. as seen via my last post i got sexually assaulted nearly 7 days ago and i’ve been going off the rails ever since. i’ve barely been sober and have been promiscuous which i’ve never been before and i have no idea why after my assault all i want it for boys to respect me and say the right things before any sexual activity occurs. i had a boy say to me he wanted to get to know me before we had sex even though it was a one night stand and if it wasn’t for that nothing would of happened between us. it gave me at the time some false sense of security knowing i’m worth something and i’m not actually just a disposable machine that’s only good for one thing and that’s it? i went out last night and i’ll spare the details as about 5 dknow a few of them don’t like me that’s evident and i’m not sure why because i’ve not personally met any of them that don’t seem to like me, a lot of it has to be because of the guy i used to see and another guy i used to see who was also there. there was also drama as on friday someone slyly took a picture of me with a boy who had his arm around me who has a girlfriend (which i didn’t know) so everyone knows it’s me but they’re only not saying anything because the boy would fight all of them and probably win and his girlfriend showed up and punched him in the face and said he cheated on her, so i was quite a big topic of conversation in that apartment clearly and it’s giving me such bad anxiety i’m just worrying what people think of me and what was said about me i just don’t know what to do... i feel like i need to redeem myself but yet i’ve just done nothing wrong?"
ptsd,anxiety,88,"i’m not sure if this is just general anxiety or an emotional flashback. but sometimes i’ll just get randomly super uncomfortable, and i can physically feeltimes just sitting in my room alone or out with friends or family. it really ruins my day and is overwhelming but i haven’t heard anyone else talk about it."
depression,bipolar,91,"latest update; if the majority wants me to go into detail in everything of my experience from that night on, the other side and such. id be happy to, i need motivation and comfort to do so. well ive never been on this website. i just googled my thoughts thorough and sorta winded up here. 29 hours ago i ate 30 tablets which of brand i will not state due to security, i drank 10liters of beer, one bowl of hash and said bye. i met my childhood friend, he said i was more than welcome, he missed me, we'd have fun. i instantly thought i was trippin on some sort of marked dope. my long lost friend told me about times i forgot by far, in details, things that i miss. i felt like i was hanging out with him for weeks, when suddenly i saw an old woman which i clearly knew (not going further into details but she is well known by our family as a psychic). she told me to say loudly if i was happy at the moment, which i did. we sat and spoke for what felt ly first language, i just see patterns in my head to how it should sound due to my autism. lets start again, i've already fallen back twice. adrenaline popped somewhere in my shoulder to get me back last time, not due to the fact id wanna die. but i've gotten severe damage from the attempt which the doctor said would make life ""different"" for now im doing okay, im tired. really really tired. i feel empty and for the moment completely alone. doc put on donnie darko today, i watched the whole thing thinking about depression and family for some reason. i've seen it a gazillion times but that's the first step to ""different"" i guess, im not familiar with the feelings i got at the moment and im gonna keep posting daily (as far as my body and mind lets me). for the moment i can barely do it, fyi i would never even start typing on here today if it wasn't for all the support and heroism in mankind. you are all my glowing angels, thank you. -xx dxty 3m"
adhd,anxiety,92,"you know that feeling when your willpower gas tank is empty, all your energy to keep pushing is burnt, and you have to take a break? getting to that point and working through makes me extremely uncomfortable, and it's the closet thing to physical pain i can imagine without actually being it. hard things cost even more energy than theyseriously when i tell him i need break, or i can't do this alone, especially when we're behind schedule on things. which is always. can anyone help me explain to him why i can't just ""buckle down and ride it out"" like he always has? edit: thank you everyone for your responses! i hope others find them as helpful to their lives as i have"
bipolar,depression,93,"recently, kanye west has been placed into the spotlight due to his mania causing him to say several things. people continue to make it seem like it’s a joke or it’s funny. does it make anyone else mad that they’re making mental illness a joke? people genuinely think he’s trying to do it for attention and disregard the fact that this man has been off his medication for 2 years"
anxiety,bipolar,98,"oh hey, you again. i thought i would be alone today since yesterday i slept a lot, ate healthy and exerciced; but yet here you are. waking up with you is not exactly what i wanted (nor expected), but i guess there is nothing i can do. today you are like my shade again, following me everywhere i go. it does not really matter what i do since you will probably stay with me at least for the rest you deteriorate a bit more my identity, thanks to you i am completely lost. but not today. because even if you want to, today you will not have the energy to stop me, today it is me who controls you. i know i cannot fight you, but i want you to try and exhaust you until you vanish. because this is what you deserve. so good luck with that, i really want to see you try. best regards, your owner."
adhd,bipolar,100,"any time i manage to get to the doctor and get my prescription filled before i run out of pills i have this sense like i just dodged this enormous freight train of life mangling destruction. the pharmacy i use is attached to a grocery store so for some reason the i imagine the train dressed like strange danger and its waiting for me in the cookies isle. not much else to say, just felt like sharing."
bipolar,none,101,"it does a really good job of exploring the ways in which traditional eastern religion and modern neuroscience overlap. if you're interested in how meditation/mindfulness techniques can help with managing your swings, definitely check it out. most of the content is available for free on google books."
ptsd,depression,102,"i only feel comfortable communicating with people who have some sort of serious mental health issue themselves as well, or are professionals in the field, thus very understanding. i am so tired of being lonely and limited in my abilities to make connections with people."

bipolar,anxiety,107,"lately i've been having this issue with how time passes. i don't seem to feel it pass. like it's ten thirty pm for me right now, and i don't feel like a day has passed. i haven't been doing anything absorbing wween setting it and the alarm. it's kind of a problem. i don't seem to realize that i'm wasting as much as i am because time doesn't register at all. has anyone else experienced this? is there anything i can do?"
adhd,anxiety,111,"not sure if anyone else has experienced this, but when i get into a political or race based discussion with someone, or any discussion with moral issues or things people are heavily opinionated about, i hit a mental wall. its like, i trating for me because i feel like i'm unable to think past the surface level of things and am unable to express my opinions without being judged due to my inability to stay on topic with coherent thoughts. any advice/thoughts on this?"
anxiety,ptsd,112,"i feel like i've become a shit ton better as a person, but there are those nights that make me relive all those bad moments and i beat myself up so much that i get seriously messed up. what i wouldn't give to go back and do it all over the right way again..that way, i might've made better friends who would've lasted through maybe? or maybe these experiences, they've made me better as a person? they've shaped me? i dont know at this point."

anxiety,ptsd,121,"i quit my job today. it was fucking terrible. not quitting, but being there. from september, i've had the worst time working there and trying my best for an abusive relationship. it took every fiber of my being to go through with it, but i feel like i've shed a ten ton husk. long time lurker, but i had to make an account to post this."

none,depression,137,most people get relased after 14 years or earlier after commiting brutal crimes like murder . but here is a man who spent 54 years in prison without committing a crime and without facing a trial . the entire system is a joke. god knows how many such people are still in the prsion.
bipolar,depression,140,"yesterday was rough. i broke things off with my ex the day before yesterday due to some toxic and manipulative behavior. he freaked out on me and has been sending me messages on every app possible saying some of the most horrible things imaginable up until yesterday evening when i blocked him on everything possible. we we're dating for 6 years and i feel so fucking dumb. it was obvious he was trying to hurt me and he didn't, but he den i said i didn't want to hang again he tried to blame me for his actions so i blocked him too. i think i'm ok emotionally, but what the fuck? idk why i keep attracting people like this. i just don't understand and i'm so sick of it. i'm a sweet person and i don't feel like i deserve it. anyway, i just wanted to vent about my fucking horrible day yesterday. it was a scary day. as always, you guys are wonderful people and thank you :)"
adhd,bipolar,142,"some days, i get a lot of stuff done. if i’m on a roll. there are also areas like some school subjects i do well in. those days/specific areas are somehow the mos the chores my partner asked me to, leaves a mess, lies down catatonic on the couch for hours, snaps at criticism and bursts into tears of frustration - oh, right."
bipolar,ptsd,144,"do any of you have or had trouble taking responsibility for things? i'm 30 years old and feeling like i'm just now understanding my part in all the bad (and good) parts of my life. i recently realized how i treated my exes and the head games i played. i always thought ""head games"" we're intentional and this discovery has helped me forgive others because i don't think some of them meant to either. my last relationship had a lot of m i'm not diagnosed, i believe i have boarder line personality disorder. both of my more recent exes have told me i am abusive in my own ways (usually emotionally distant when needed but full on dependent during my own constant crises.) it's a damn shame i put so many men through hell without even taking their emotions seriously. anyway, those who share their problems with the blame game: do you have any suggestions? books? anything?"
bipolar,depression,150,because any kind of sickness is more tolerable than depression when it gets bad. i feel guilty for being around others when i might be contagious but it's what i have to do.
adhd,ptsd,158,was anyone else reminded of what a burden and a distraction they were to the point that now they go to moronic lengths not to inconvenience anyone? i often do this and it always makes things worse. any coping strategies?

anxiety,depression,165,"tomorrow i bury my best friend who tragically passed away at the age of 25. i'm heartbroken and i will be speaking at his funeral. i am happy with the speech but i am nervous, petrified to mess up. he was an incredible guy and i want to send him off well, justify what he meant to me. my ex who broke up with me 2 months ago has kept contact to ask how i have been doing and if i ever needed anything go to her. i went to the gym yesterday evening just to pass the time and maybe work off a small hangover i was nursing from the night before. i felt okay but by the end of my session i was very tired. as i was walking back towards my flat i spot my ex with a guy next to her sitting down. i could have turned around but i didn't. i go up to her and say hi, she seems shocked to see me and asks if i'm doing okay. i say no, not really and say i'll leave them to it and say goodbye. as i walk down the road my ex has caught up with me after she runs to catch up with me. she says she has done this to tell me thatuy who has a family that makes her laugh, feel alive. this guy has a child. i recognise him from her xmas party. i'm really confused about why she chased after me. it's obvious she cares but is she feeling guilty, trying to spare my feelings in the hardest time of my life. i do want her back in my life but seeing her with another guy hurt big time. seeing them close to each other eating ice cream. she works with him, did she like him when we were dating. i also hate the idea of her sharing her sympathy and support with other people, especially a guy like that. and it hurts to hear her say to me he's going through a hard time. i'm going through the hardest time of my life. i feel like i can't use her as a crutch. i'm so confused, hurt, a mess. i bury my best friend tomorrow . i am absolutely terrified. i feel sick, like i'm going to mess up and ruin everything. the last 2 months has been the worst of my life, it just has. i want things to be better. i want him back. i want her back. i feel terrible."

(this is not an advertisement, just an idea. i don't work for movie pass.) i spoke to my private showing. so maybe if you're like me and love movies, a subscription service may be the thing to help you leave the house. amc theaters also has a subscription service for $20 a month if you can afford that.

""i don't care if you fail, i care if you try."" too fucking bad dad, i care more if i fail than if i try, and i get that that doesn't get me anywhere; it feels pretty shitty to be reminded my ridiculous rejection sensitivity makes me a terrible person. fine, impedes my success. you didn't call me a terrible person. but that's what i'm getting at. the rejection sensitivity. what amounted to ""your not trying for the sake of avoiding getting hurt disappoints and irritates me"" turned into ""you're a terrible person."" or maybe i took it to mean ""you're broken."" i often think i am. how do you think it feels when i submit 10 job applications and my brain does the same thing about not hearing back? how do you think it feels to be constantly looking at jobs trying to balance what i'm qualified for, what won't be soul-crushingly mind-numbing, and what will actually move me forward in life? and then after beating myself up to get myself to start and continue that process, getting discouraged either not hearing back or hearing i didn't get the job. and then there's: what if i actually here back? interviews are std am now telling myself ""you're gonna be the lazy drug using social security beneficiary nobody wants to get their money"" while i tell myself i don't deserve it because i feel like a liar. but you know what? it may hurt, **but i take it on for you**. because i acknowledge my debilitating fear of trying on the job front and would rather take on shame than let my failure to launch weigh you down. when i was growing up, i used to tell myself ""no one can hurt you more than your own family."" i think that's still true for me today. thanks dad. *do you know why i changed therapists after you got your cancer diagnosis?* **i wanted to make sure you'd be proud of me before you died.** i sure as hell don't feel like you are right now. tl;dr: my dad hurt me and pissed me off by telling me he doesn't feel like i try and expressing frustration at how much time i put into videogames (where i can at least feel successful at **something**) when i spent less time on videogames today than half of what i spend most days in general. seriously, videogaming and weight loss are the only two things i've succeeded at since graduation. maybe not dying, too, but i don't think that should count. good to know i'm a disappointment."
depression,bipolar,333,"i'm an 18(m) who has sporadic depressive episodes. i've told some of my friends both indirectly and explicitly. and i always regret it. i hate the way they feel like they are treading on thin ice around me, but then i clearly desire attention if i told them in the first place. i've tried saying it to close friends (mostly when drunk) and also tried using fairly obvious forms of art as well. whatever i do, whoever i talk to, i wish i just stayed on my own. probably going to end up regretting this aswell."
bipolar,depression,334,"last week i wore my hair up everyday to work. not because i particularly like the way it looks, but because i couldn’t will myself the effort to take a shower for 5 days. wearing my “depression” hoodie that is 3 sizes too big, just so i can ignore my weight issue and have it’s dog hair covered fabric drape around my already dirty pajama shirt that i wore the last 4 nights. being this kind of sad is funny that way even something as mundane and rudimentary as doing my laundry takes more effort f glitter about to explode taking shots at the bar with my friends and oversharing too much with too many people this happiness turns agitated and irritable every small inconvenience feels like i might just turn green, sprout some brown shorts and call myself hulk like a rubber band that is twisting tighter and tighter until it snaps. and cuts my arm with an exacto knife and down i fall again… when people ask me how i am they should just ask me who i am today and what does my laundry look like"

adhd,depression,679,"sorry, this is long. so, just like the title says, i cleaned my room yesterday. i mean, i really cleaned it. it was disorganized and always messy and it had been driving me nuts for probably a year. i made a deal with my husband that every saturday we would choose one area of the house and purge it and really scrub it. we've lived in our house for 6years and we neaten it here and there, clean it up better when company comes, but we've never really gone room by room and sorted everything and purged all the old stuff and scrubbed the corners and walls and stuff. so this is pretty embarrassing, but i normally use natural cleaners for everything except the toilet and i've never really scrubbed everything hard- just surface cleaning here and there to get it a step above unsanitary and gross. yesterday i broke out the big guns and used an entire brand new can of scrubbing bubbles just on my makeup counter and toilet/shower area (our house was built in the 70's and our sink is in our bedroom opposite another counter vanity for make up, and the toilet and shower are in a tiny little room with a pocket door). you guys, i dusted everything, scrubbed the window frames, washed the windows, cleaned our lampshades inside and out including the bulbs. i scrubbed all the baseboards, washed and reorganized my medicine cabinet shelves and cabinet drawers, sctackling their bedrooms. little by little we're going to make our way through the whole house and de-clutter and organize it. it's such a daunting task, but just knowing how good it feels to get it done is huge motivation! i'm also trying to not berate myself for letting it get so bad. cleaning is probably my least favorite activity ever, but i feel so good when things are picked up and cleaned. i know it's better for my mental health and feeling in control, too. more motivation to get rid of a lot of extra crap taking up room in my life! tl;dr-cleaned my room and it was much worse than i'd realized. motivated to keep the momentum going and get the rest of the house in order. edit:: i thought i should give an update! it has been three weeks and my room is still clean! i can't even believe it, but it is!!! dh and i both also clean all three of our kids rooms and i cleared up a lot of launfry today. i can't even begin to tell you how motivating it is to get this done. i think i've reached a point where i actually want to clean things up because of how nice it feels! we still have some pretty major sections of the house to work our way through and it will be a chore to get the kids to be more cognizant of their rooms, but after three saturdays of committing to this it feels like i'm almost at the stage of making it a new normal! *happy dance!*"

depression,bipolar,1106,"kinda shitty advice. but i'll start with some backstory. i'm on mobile so forgive me. (this will be kinda rambly) i was diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety disorder after i checked into a psychiatric hospital a few years back, but i always felt as i grew up that something was wrong. when i went to go meet my biological mother (who is very bipolar) when i was 18 things started to click with me that i needed to figure out a way to find meaning. it didn't help that my step-mom was an abusive cunt. so overall i kinda suck at being a person.(still do) anyways, i've struggled with constantly feeling down, and also feeling a whole lotta shit i didn't really understand. because of this i turned to weed and alcohol when i was 15. went through a few phases of drinking hard, but really weed was my poison of choice(still dont think it's bad but that's for another sub). again anyways because of the plant i kinda regained a sense of what it meant to be a healthy functioning member of society, but it was  pay the rent, things get complicated with family, with work, with life. and all of it together makes me wanna opt out. but then i think of leaving him by himself to deal with it himself and what a living hell that would be. even if i cant do much, ill do what i can till i can't. because if i dont that would make me sadder than anything i can ever encounter in my life. my point is that out there there are strong, amazing, incredibly intelligent and driven people, who do this shit alone. while feeling everything. and its heart breaking. my dad spent his life trying to make me feel welcome when every fiber of my being says i don't belong on this earth. the least i can do is gtfo bed and try to do something. even if my battle that day is just to brush my teeth. so that he can see a good looking smile that he made. to make him feel just a little better. that's my part, my mission. thats what gets me up. there are people that can use your help, and you owe it to them. but that s just my opinion."

bipolar,depression,1179,"depression has been my thing for a majority of my life, nothing ever worked until we started treating it as bp2 with lamictal. it’s been a couple of months on 200 mg and the other day i realized that i’m not irritable, angry, or just consars. don’t get me wrong it’s an good feeling, i actually feel like a person rather than mental illness but i honestly think it was easier to feel the apathy that came from soul sucking depression. so much to do, to catch up on and it sucks"
bipolar,anxiety,1181,she's still an infant and i'm already worried that she knows that mommy is going through the motions some days. i try to keep doing our regular activities but it is so hard to smile and look and act enthusiastic. i'm just so tired and sad and i'm not sure i'm giving her what she needs. i'd love to hear your advice and experiences.
depression,adhd,1185,"does anyone else ever feel like... they aren’t doing things for enjoyment but they’re just doing manual controls of themselves bc they have to? “ okay now it’s time to eat. okay that’s done, now it’s time to lay down. okay that’s done, now it’s time to see your friends” but everything really just feels like you’re going through the motions without any real enjoyment?"
anxiety,depression,1188,"for example, my parents are going away for a week later this year. i don't want to be at home alone, but i can't sleep out of my house, i haven't slept out in at least 10 years. i asked a friend if they would mind sleeping over and they were like ""sure! i'd be glad to"". i was like, what, they just agreed like that??? they're so cool with sleeping out???? what???? aren't they going to miss their bed? and pets? and family? so weird to me."

adhd,bipolar,1207,"so, you've spent a while working hard at school/life/career/relationships. things have been going well, and all of a sudden some much needed time off comes along. you've got half the week off, and the other half is pretty light in comparison, so it's the fucking best. you can slack off a little bit, and let your mind wander, and there's no ill effects, because everyone does iticult. you got this. slowly scale back your bed time and get a little more rest each night. try to set some reasonable alarms for yourself this weekend, so you keep up the pattern of waking up before noon, and try to make a short to do list to be able to check off some accomplishments. remember, forgive yourself, and don't let any stumbles make you feel like everything is lost."
bipolar,anxiety,1210,things aren’t even that bad for me right now. last week was way worse. i’m doing okay at work keeping up with my to do list. i’m getting along with the family. for some reason i feel like i want to go to the hospital to get away from life. this is a feeling i’ve had many times. i always remind myself how much more comfortable my bed is in those moments. does anyone else have those thoughts?
adhd,bipolar,1212,"edit: i would say that a comparison to how a ""normal"" person functions is this - a normal can stand in the middle of the room and softly bounce the ball repeatedly off one wall, but i am only able to throw the ball with extra strength and it essentially shoots out of my hand and requires other walls to bounce to."
anxiety,bipolar,1214,"i came into this year in a good place after years of wading through shit. i was kicking ass at my job, i have sorted a long term medical problem, i achieved dreams this winter by freeride snowboarding a mountain. i came out as bi / genderfluid to my family and it went well. but this year since then has fucked me up. i haven't touched another human in three months. i've been single for 12 years. i happening again every day recently. i don't want to see any more fucking therapists any more i hate the idea of it. i can't go through reopening all that painful old stuff again i don't want to deal with this bullshit any more. i don't want to burden my family with this, i've put them through enough. fucking 2020. its a good job i don't have a gun because its sure looking like a way to escape recently."

ptsd,bipolar,1218,i've seen three different doctors and none of them will give me my meds. i'm literally getting to the point i will just buy the pills off the internet and risk going to prison just to function. they keep trying to tell me there are other meds that help that aren't addictive. why do they keep telling me this fucking lie and why the fuck do they believe it!!! i guess i'll just drink to function because that's what these people fucking want. i want to strangle these fucking doctors.

anxiety,depression,1227,like i hate it for two reasons because first of all it either emasculating or infantilising. and second it implies that im not doing my best or at the least not trying or sometimes it comes off as someone making light of my feelings.

anxiety,ptsd,1274,"i just noticed this a couple of days ago when i was messaging back and forth with my boyfriend the whole day. i had just finished volunteering at a crisis hotline and we we were talking about how i needed a recommendation letter from them for my social work degree program and he was saying ""it sounds like an intense program, but if anyone can do it it's my hat said ""he's going to break up with you way before that."" yesterday my boyfriend got way into this new game he got and he wasn't really paying attention to me or anyone or anything else really which just made more of those negative thoughts pop into my head like he doesn't love me. it was so bad that i couldn't sleep last night. i just need advice i guess."
depression,bipolar,1278,i won’t give up i won’t give up i won’t give up i won’t give up i won’t give up i won’t give up. no matter what happens no matter how hard it gets i can do it i won’t give up.
bipolar,anxiety,1282,"i'm just curious to see if this happens to anyone else; the title is pretty self explanatory. (tl;dr at bottom) i don't mean like i'm ""out of it"" or even just fatigued for the day and my brain loses its train of thought one too many times. i feel like that happens to everyone at least once in a while (including myself). i mean like it takes an insane amount of mental energy for me to say a sentence from start to finish correctly, usually takes me a few tries to do so. so to say a 3 sentence response to somethiow to speak in general. anyone else have similar experiences? tl;dr: does anyone sometimes find their speech to be very impaired, like you feel as if you forgot how to speak at all? maybe due to an episode, personal issues, both, etc? edit: thank you so much everyone who replied to this post, sharing your experiences and such. one of my biggest insecurities is my speech (due to the issue mentioned in this post) and it's so comforting to have so much nice, supportive feedback and to know i'm not alone on this :)"
depression,anxiety,1284,i make a lot of mistakes and am very awkward so i end up thinking the words “kill yourself” dozens of times a day. it’s like a reflex at this point. i’m not actually going to kill myself but it’s like some subconscious desire bubbling up from deep down. i’m afraid i’ll start saying it out loud or something
ptsd,anxiety,1285,"slithering around, i can sometimes feel it wrapping around my thoughts. sometimes it'll tempt and induce fear that it may strike and then sit back, other times it will strangle and constrict my thoughts, biting and injecting it's venom into my thought circuit. i feel like there's an ever elusive way to drive it out of my head, that frustratingly isn't a concrete, logical method to do."
adhd,depression,1286,"volunteer at a nature park. i did that once for school before depression made it hard to go to school. it was great, made me feel productive, helped me socialize, and made me happy. it is something i can do, believe in, and will be make me happy. :)"

depression,anxiety,1291,"you want certian people to always be there for you but they just can't be. they're busy and have their own lives. or maybe they just don't understand how much you're going througlly maybe showed concern for my well being. i just want to spend time with someone my age who actually also wants to hangout with me, and not just me wanting to hangout with them."
adhd,none,1302,something i see mentioned a lot in this sub is people mentioning thy carry their daily doses in pill containers on keychains instead of the prescription bottle. just wanted to remind everyone that these are controlled substances and illegal to carry without a prescription. i don charge. obviously this charge would be dismissed once you show proof of prescription but please keep this in mind. a good way to have proof on you at all times is to take a picture of your pill bottle each time you fill your prescription since you always have your phone on you.

ptsd,depression,1317,i understand that it says more about them but i can’t help but feeling pain whenever i see yet another person that shows deliberate apathy towards me. everyone in my family and everyone i thought was my friend have been narcissistic. incapable of empathy.
adhd,bipolar,1327,"wow, i am overwhelmed by everyone's support! let me clarify a few things with some background info: after 4 1/2 long years, i graduate in a month. in fact, last night i was finishing up my capstone project that's due today and i was having the hardest time because i put half of it off until last minute and i'm stressed the fuck out. anyway, even though i made it through college, i'm now being faced with new challenges and a shit ton of deadlines. i'm graduating in a few weeks, yet i missed a doctors appointment recently because i forgot, still have trouble with not wasting my time for hours and have two labs that are kicking my ass and i can't keep up. however, this morning i woke up to a reminder that though it's an uphill battle, especially while managing bipolar disorder, that i really am doing better than i think. whether you're freshman in the same shoes i was in four years ago, or are thriving the career you worked your ass off for, your advice, encouragement and the courage to open up have inspired the hell out of me. every single one of you. that being said, i want to share something in return that i hope will encourage you as well: i was never a model student. i dicked around in high school (on the days i actually went lol). i was your standard class clown. my grades were average, but i was always late and had to work extra hard to keep up. senior year, i accepted that since nobody believed i would make it through my first year of college, it was probably true. my first year, i was eust like your heart, meaning mental health issues should be combatted just like you would any other part of your body. you can't just one day decide that because you've changed your mindset that you don't have heart disease, just like you can't do that with adhd. obviously. the good news is, is that together, by sharing our experiences and simple solutions, we can at least all go about this knowing that we are not alone. i understand not everyone has access to resources such as medication and therapy, and i truly respect anyone who has gone without. ultimately, it is coming to the realization that you are the one who has to initially seek help, which is hard when it's hard to do anything in the first place. if you are reading this, that means you are already one step ahead because you're on this subreddit. thank you to everyone who has taken the time to share your time management solutions, love and other things you've done that have helped you with daily tasks. these are valuable insights that can truly make a difference. i took some advice i read in a comment on another thread and had a productive day yesterday. it wasn't much, my damn it was satisfying when i looked at how much i'd crossed of my to-do list. alright, so i have to get back to my project but i could not ignore the outpouring of support from my fellow adhders. also, if anyone has any questions or just needs somebody to talk to, message me. i'm so glad i found this community. remember, you're awesome. go kick today's ass. cheers"
anxiety,depression,1335,"i love to grow flowers, it's pretty much my only hobby and the main way that i de-stress. i have flower beds all around my house and i view my plants as my ""babies."" but last year my emotional support cat passed away at 12 years old and i feel like my soul went with him, it was thet getting nervous and going back inside. now my beloved garden has its life back, and i feel a little bit better. now that i have new things popping up from the ground i have no excuse to ignore them. i hope i can muster up the strength to keep going. for today, i'm proud of myself."
adhd,anxiety,1338,"just in case anyone isn't aware of what learned helplessness feels like, and as a warning to people not to keep trying the same thing over and over, i've written the following. i will use the term ""brain"" to refer to the unconscious, impulsive parts of the brain, the parts that aren't ""you"", and ""you"" to refer to your conscious experience and rational brain. (disclaimer, this is only my experience, i don't know what other people's experiences are.) --- imagine walking around, going through life, except you don't decide what you do. your brain decides everything for you and you have no say. it wants to play video games, so you play video games. that isn't to say you don't fight it, but on those occasions that you do you either are simply unable to do anything, or every frustration with yourself for every past failure floods upon you, washing your willpower away in a tidal wave of anxiety. you quickly learn the only way to fight is to not fight at all. --- now, imagine somebody calmly tells you, ""i know it's hard, but you really need to just get up and do it. i have no magic bullet unfortunately."" this is nice, they know that you have a hard time ""just doing it"" but at this point there's no way around it, it just needs to be done. you wholeheartedly agree with them, and feel like the ultimate solution _is_ to ""just do it"". your brain however immediately reminds you how ""it's never worked before, so why will it work now?"" this isn't just a small voice, it is backed by the combined anxiety of every failure and inadequacy you have ever had. --- i'll attempt to explain what lies behind this sense of hopelessness: this sense of hopelessness, in its simplest form, is the feeling that ""it's never worked, so why would it change?"" however, it goes deeper than that. the following is the main thought process: - according to other people you just need to try hard enough to solve the problem - you feel like you have tried counn't care anymore"" ( ditto ) - ""i hate myself"" (when i metaphorically close my eyes, cover my ears, and run from what i need to do yelling ""lalalalalalalala"", also when i am sitting doing something i enjoy and remember what i'm supposed to be doing) - ""i just can't."" (when i try to calm myself or when i'm lying in a fetal position on the bed, spiraling deeper into depression) - ""i just want the world to go away"" (this feeling makes me realize why some people kill themselves. i fortunately just retreat to my bed or some form of entertainment that allows my brain to shut off temporarily) --- i'm not saying this is permanent problem, or that there aren't any solutions, just that it's incredibly difficult, more difficult than i feel most anyone can imagine. it's the torture of hopelessness, with the frustration of fully knowing with your rational brain that hope itself is all that is needed to solve the problem, yet finding that hope hopelessly far away. please, everyone. think before you tell someone to ""just try."" they may have forgotten how to. --- edit: some people may say that you just need to build in systems, and i agree that that is a good solution, but at least for me, i've tried so many of my own systems that even trying to talk with it causes my brain to lock up with anxiety. likely because it forces me to confront all my past failures, which further discourages me from trying. i'd still love to hear any advice people have though. --- tl;dr; learned helplessness isn't thinking you are helpless, it is feeling that you've forgotten how to try. if you really wanted to try it would have worked, since people say to just try, so you must not really _want_ to try, so you begin to instead want to want to try. in addition, confronting it in any way brings with it all the anxiety of every past failure, meaning that often, instead of doing something you often fail to do you just close your eyes and hope it'll go away."
adhd,anxiety,1339,"i recently learnt that executive dysfunction can be broken down into two main categories: anxiety that your attempt won't be satisfactory, or confusion about where to start or how to break it down into steps. as much as we feel bad about it, it's extremely important to remember that it is not laziness and we in fact shouldn't feel bad."

bipolar,anxiety,1372,i’m singing everything and forcing myself to not sing on my conference calls. at least this is a feel good one! i almost want to decorate for christmas while i should be working but i know i have stuff i need to do.
anxiety,bipolar,1382,"have just come of my meds last month after managing to travel the world for a year on my own and then staring my first year at university. years ago i physically couldn’t leave the house for months at a time out of fear, now i am a completely new person. you can beat this, no matter how long it takes."
anxiety,ptsd,1385,"when i was younger my sister was seen as the ""pretty"" one and i was seen as the ""smart"" one. now i go to a university full of beautiful pretentious women and it makes me so anxious that i want to kill myself. i also just got out of an abusive relationship where my ex didn't give two shits about me so i'm sure that's contributing as well. nonetheless, i would love some advice or at least hear from other people who have dealt with a similar situation. thanks."
adhd,depression,1389,thank you to this [wonderful who went waaaay out of their way to try and hurt my feelings but ended up turning a bad day into a good one because it reminded me that some people have it worse. there are people out there who only feel good when they make others feel bad and those are the people to feel truly sorry for. i'm so flattered that they saw me as a target :)
ptsd,anxiety,1396,"i’m incredibly nervous but i’ve decided to try some medical marijuana this week. maybe next if i chicken out. something has to change. i feel like i’ve been doing whatever i can for the last two decades and plateaued with my health in the last four years or so. my medication, support system, physical activity level, and therapy are helpful but i still feel very frostrain is tailored to my issues and i trust my “bud tender” but am terrified to lose control. but i think it could be the best type of exposure therapy for me. obviously my greatest fear is losing control but having a mild experience with some mj and facing it could be helpful. or it could be really, really bad. anyone relate to this or have tried anything similar ?"
none,adhd,1399,"maybe this way of saying it is fine, but when people ask around and compare test scores, i genuinely believe and want to tell people that they shouldn't focus on what other people scored but focus on themselves and their own work. i don't want to sound too formal or even rude since i am a student. so how should i reply to people asking whatever test mark i received?"
ptsd,anxiety,1412,"i feel completely trapped in my own head. i've had that ""chair is about to fall backward"" feeling day in and day out for like three weeks now. it's becoming exhausting. i feel like a thousand screaming emotions are trapped behind a stone exterior. i can't cry or yell or write. i can't express any emotions, even for moms most of the time, it's just particularly bad right now and trying to out-logic my emotions is just overwhelming sometimes. right now is one of those times. you guys are my people and i guess i'm not really looking for solutions, just someone to remind me that it will pass and maybe offer up some tips on self-care."
adhd,bipolar,1421,so tonight i was setting out my meds for tomorrow morning on my napkin while drinking a cup of water and i..... you guessed it...... took my meds. i tried to f so yeah.... i have to wake up in 3 hours and 20 minutes and i am nowhere near tired. &amp;#x200b; tl;dr don't drink anything while setting out your meds my guy
anxiety,bipolar,1422,"good morning y’all. i’m currently on my way to my very first day at work and it’s nerve-racking to say the least! i’m all different types of emotions right now. happy, excited, and nervous as hell. anyway, my job is as an it pet goes well and i can get through it because it would be a huge milestone for me. edit: wow. thank you guys so much. i kept rereading these throughout the day at points and you all made me feel so much better. the day went well!"

adhd,bipolar,1430,"nobody else in my life would understand this but i know you guys would. all my life i have been shit at school and academic learning. i've been medicated for almost two years now. i heard today that my assignment for a professional qualification scored 80%, one of the highest marks given. i could never have done that prior to treatment. i am so god damn proud of myself."
bipolar,ptsd,1431,"i know i still deal with a lot of guilt because of my own journey of recovery: the starts and stops, random days when you’re not coping the best, feeling like i sectives, experiences, and places we start from. if you’re road is bumpy, off the beaten path, that’s ok. if anything, remember to be kind to yourself this weekend."
bipolar,depression,1434,"hey everyone! i’m bp2, diagnosed officially 2 months ago. i am a teacher in elementary school, and i just left work again for the fourth time in one month due to my depression. i can only fake a nd so listless. i am also in my last semester of my doctorate and this call really would not have come at a worse time. i would love a little support from the wonderful, caring people on this sub!"
anxiety,adhd,1435,"hi guys, so yesterday i (23f) had my graduation and i asked my family to be there. i wanted to share this moment, but nothing big. i wanted to go to lunch with them,my food) it wasnt my day. but my sister (43) told me ( as everybody else tells me) 'dont whine. they mean well and suck it up' *tl;dr: is it sellfish?! is it really?*"
adhd,anxiety,1437,"every time i get into an argument/ debate i’m either a second away from crying or a second away from an angry outburst. it’s so hard to keep my cool and as a result... i learned to stop talking/ people please/ avoid the topic whenever thin the rest of the day because i feel like i’ve been rejected. everytime i feel rejected i suddenly think everyone is going to abandon me, and i get stuck in that feeling. i’m learning slowly and taking my time... but god does this shit suck!"
adhd,ptsd,1439,receiving this diagnosis has opened up so many doors for me that i myself had shut and locked because i never believed i was capable of doing it. treatment has completely transformed my ability to perform academically and i’m eternally grateful for that. my goal is to continue earning a 4.0 so i might have a chance of getting into grad school in a couple years!🙏🏻
adhd,anxiety,1443,"apologies for long post / first post awkwardness. i was diagnosed about a month ago after going to several doctors about my struggles. the first doctor dismissed me because ""i didn't fail in school"". the second said i was just distracted by my own anxiety. finally went to a psychiatrist who clocked add right away, paired with generalised anxiety disorder. the reactions of friends and family have been sceptical at best, and their main comment is ""but you've always done so well."" yes, from the outside i'm not a failure: * passed school * got a four year degree * got a job and got promoted * now self employed as a consultant the truth is, even though i was so desperate for a diagnosis, part of me is rejecting it becaget an identity crisis when they get diagnosed?** do you find you have to retell your life story to people - with the ugly parts you never shared before - so that they get it? i also feel a little cheated because i'm 28 and have spent a lot of my adult life reading self-help books, trying to accept and love myself as i am. only to discover that things i've fought so hard to love about myself (like being overweight) are a legit by-product of messed up chemistry in my brain (i'm now losing weight effortlessly since starting concerta, because i'm not impulsively eating &amp; obsessing about food.) **tl;dr recently diagnosed, people don't believe me because i've never let myself fail in public. anyone else like this?**"
bipolar,anxiety,1448,"came across this and thought they may be useful for anyone suffering from mild depression: does anyone religiously do cbt and if so did it help? **common cognitive distortions** a partial list from robert l. leahy, stephen j. f. holland, and lata k. mcginn’s [*treatment plans and interventions for depression and anxiety disorders*] (2012) 1. **mind reading** you assume that you know what people think without having sufficient evidence of their thoughts. “he thinks i’m a loser.” 2. **fortune-telling** you predict the future negatively: things will get worse, or there is danger ahead. “i’ll fail that exam,” or “i won’t get the job.” 3. **catastrophizing** you believe that what has happened or will happen will be so awful and unbearable that you won’t be able to stand i feel now,” or “my parents caused all my problems.” 10. **what if?** you keep asking a series of questions about “what if” something happens, and you fail to be satisfied with any of the answers. “yeah, but what if i get anxious?,” or “what if i can’t catch my breath?” 11. **emotional reasoning** you let your feelings guide your interpretation of reality. “i feel depressed; therefore, my marriage is not working out.” 12. **inability to disconfirm** you reject any evidence or arguments that might contradict your negative thoughts. for example, when you have the thought i’m unlovable, you reject as irrelevant any evidence that people like you. consequently, your thought cannot be refuted. “that’s not the real issue. there are deeper problems. there are other factors.”"
adhd,bipolar,1450,"hey everyone, can we talk about a serious topic for a moment? i want to hear the community's experience on masturbation and medication. **is anybody else experiencing porn addiction or extremely long fap sessions that are hard to stop early?** --- my story: i've always had some elements of porn &amp; masturbation addiction but it never got out of hand (pun intended) nor did it ever affect my life. i wouldn't have  way to overcome it or mitigate it, but failed. this week i've started nofap since my own personal measures didn't work. if i can't fix it myself by the next time i see my psych, it's too serious for me not to tell him about all this. --- **am i the only one that experiences this? do you guys have any similar experiences?** thank you for your thoughts or anything at all. i just ask that you keep it serious. thanks."
anxiety,ptsd,1452,"i just got hired for a job that pays pretty well, and the hours are well-suited for me, working about 4-6 hours per day, and i am super happy about it because i quit many jobs because of its long hours, and i hope this one last and that i wouldn't have any attacks at work!"
none,ptsd,1459,"i'm feeling very discouraged. i have a fever, sore throat and cold and my bunk mates and i confirmed we have bed bug bites this morning. the hostel confirmed it and now i'm hanging around waitt bitten. not sure if the washing machine will fit my bag. i have only been on this trip 4 days and while the travelling has been amazing, bed bugs and sick to start off with has been horrible."
anxiety,depression,1460,"for example: let's say i have this appointment next tuesday, at 4pm. up until that day, it's not too bad. i know it's not that day yet, so i'm able to relax a little bit. ""oh, i don't have to do that thing for a another few days, thank god"" but then slowly the day of starts rolling around. the day before i start getting this terrible grumpy attitude and mood, i start feeling depressed, my day is ruined because of this thing the  honestly feel like i'm trapped in a jail cell. but then, after all of that, a huge sigh of relief just blows over me. this thing i've been worrying about wasn't even that bad, but the build-up is the real killer, the real anxiety builder and sometimes i honestly feel like i'm losing my sanity. i go from this grumpy, depressed guy to someone absolutely happy beyond belief at least for those few hours after getting something done."
bipolar,ptsd,1461,"i've been feeling needy and ignored lately, the thing is i'm not interacting with anyone really outside my so. it's too much to handle right now. and my so gives me cuddles and is being helpful. there is really no one to ignore me, you know? but i just feel bad for some reason. i can't figure it out. i'm even upset when people don't reply or upvote my posts and that is really weird because i don't usually notice votes. i ruminate over whether i said the wrong thing or upset someone. i don't always reply to people i've gone into crisis i managed. i dunno, i felt a little weird after a session a few weeks ago. kinda like emdr weird and the session was kinda an unconscious exploring one, not emdr but a different therapy. i keep going back to that. i am left with just vague feelings i don't understand and just feeling uneasy. this is really bugging me. i keep expecting it to resolve, but when i'm resting or taking a time out to recharge it's really on my mind. and i feel unusually sensitive of late,since that weird appointment."
ptsd,bipolar,1462,"the other day i or i should say we went on a 1st date with a woman i had just met a couple of days earlier. i say we, because my service dog was with me. after we had eaten, we were just chatting n't remember driving home. i just couldn't think straight. i was short of breath. my heart was pounding. it had been such an amazing date up until that point. has anyone been thru anything similar?"
adhd,bipolar,1465,"i'm genuinely ecstatic! i never thought that i'd manage to come this far after my bout with depression last year but here we are! depression-free, and just full of boundless, controlled energy. but getting this job truly is by far, one of my greatest a to thank you guys for your support, you're the reason i chose to get medicated. i hope now, i can help others achieve their goals too, as part of the collective community! tl;dr: got a job at a prestigious company at age 18. never thought i'd make it."
none,adhd,1468,"i constantly bump into different strange uses of ""would"" that i just can't understand. for example ""i tried to unlock the front door, but the door wouldn't open"" this is a situation that happened in finished in the past. this is not a hypothetical situation. ""would"" here doesn't mean a habitual past action. ""would"" here doesn't express willingness to do something. isn't it supposed to be ""i tried to unlock the front door but the door didn't open"". whyyyyy?"
bipolar,depression,1472,"i don't even know where to begin. i can barely hold my phone in my hands but these thoughts have to get out. i'm seeing signs that my mental health is suffering. i don't even want to talk about the flood anymore. i dont want to talk about my house, the work on my house, the everything. i'm so damn tired. i have eaten maybe 4 times since this all started. i've been working sun up-sun down on my house, with no luck in finding a contractor to help. yesterday was my birthday. i spent it gutting my walls and packing the few things we have left. i'm ""taking the day off"" to celebrate today... and i don't even want to. i can't sleep or eat. all i can do is stare at the wall and wonder what the actual fuexhausted. i'm mostly just depressed. actually since this started i've been episodic. right now my brain is running 10x its normal pace and i'm shaking and thinking all of these crazy thoughts and at the same time i'm numb and dont want to move or talk or eat or anything. every single day since this started i've lied in bed at night thinking how much i dont want to wake up. then when i wake up in the morning i start crying immediately when it all comes rushing back that this is my reality; this is my piss poor excuse for a human existence. fuck. i'm all over the damn place right now. thanks for reading, if you have. i'm not asking for a thing. i just needed to vent this out. i guess wish me luck."
