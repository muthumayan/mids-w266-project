bipolar,depression,3,"i was just thinking today as i work on a painting and deal with soul sucking depression that i am extremely talented. i’ve gotten full ride scholarships for art school, i have won state awards, i don’t think i’ve ever not gotten into a juried show, i rule. i know how easy it is to get caught up in your negative qualities (especially with mental illness) but what are your strengths?"
ptsd,bipolar,5,"i was 21 at the time, now i'm 22. in may of 2017, i got really sick out of no where. in a matter of 3 days, i went from feeling slightly out of it, to intense thunderclap headaches, pale, body aches, delirium, and ultimately passing out. i didn't want to make a scene or go to the hospital because i was just starting a new full time job, but i had a feeling that i was going to die. i can't really explain that very well, but i just knew deep down that someone was very wrong. at 4am i took an uber to the hospital and when i got there, upon checking my vitals (very low blood pressure and 160 resting heart rate) the nurses helped me onto a wheelchair and wheeled me into a bed in the intensive care unit. at this point, my memory is very groggy but i remember multiple people helping me take my clothes off to change me into a gown, and then doing an ecg on me. they got an iv into me and gave me a valium injection, as well as nausea medicine. i thought that was odd because i didn't feel nauseous at the time. the doctor came in and asked me what was wrong. i just cried and said my head hurt so bad, adn't push me too hard my fist few weeks back (i have a very physical job). now i'm healthier, but i still have a constant fear of getting sick again. i try to explain this to my mom and friends, but they think i'm just being dramatic and a hypochondriac. i don't feel safe anywhere but the hospital. i'm constantly scared. i don't have a fear of death, but knowing that i could easily become diseased and suffer, and leave all that i love behind makes me sad. it makes me sad that people don't understand what i went through. they are not educated on sepsis and think well ""hey, she didn't have cancer"" (my coworker actually said that, and later attributed my sepsis to being a vegetarian). i really don't talk about it a lot, but when i do, i get eye rolls. it's like people think i enjoyed taking a month off work. i constantly suffer from panic attacks now, where i feel dizzy and can't breathe well, but there's not much i can do about that. ativan doesn't help. my body and mind have been through hell and no one understands, or gives a shit. thank you for reading, i just had to get this off my chest."
adhd,bipolar,6,"finished my bachelor's after 7 years, 5 years to get my aa untreated and it was extremely hard. got treatment, went back to school, and finished in 2 years while being student of the year for my major. took my 2.0 gpa that i had wt let people bring you down and don't waste time getting treatment and support. i wouldn't be here now if i didn't get the help i needed. i'm done with dead end jobs, seven years is a long time but i'm glad i did it. you can do it."
ptsd,bipolar,8,"for me, i have bought many books and i have spent lots of money on insurance, doctors visits, and medication. a significant area that i haven't invested in is therapy. instead, i have always sought out free therapy which may or may not be effective. so, what about you? what areas have you invested in?"
bipolar,anxiety,11,"monthly appointment with my doctor again. so i was a little worried about feeling this weird ""not caring"" on some things that i usually do. so i brought it up when he asked, is there anything you want to bring out? i told himed, that's the issue, i don't know. i'm not sure if it is good or bad. i said maybe imm just tired of being stressed. he smiled and i was surprised when he said, then it's good that you are becoming resilient to daily stress."
anxiety,ptsd,14,"tomorrow i bury my best friend who tragically passed away at the age of 25. i'm heartbroken and i will be speaking at his funeral. i am happy with the speech but i am nervous, petrified to mess up. he was an incredible guy and i want to send him off well, justify what he meant to me. my ex who broke up with me 2 months ago has kept contact to ask how i have been doing and if i ever needed anything go to her. i went to the gym yesterday evening just to pass the time and maybe work off a small hangover i was nursing from the night before. i felt okay but by the end of my session i was very tired. as i was walking back towards my flat i spot my ex with a guy next to her sitting down. i could have turned around but i didn't. i go up to her and say hi, she seems shocked to see me and asks if i'm doing okay. i say no, not really and say i'll leave them to it and say goodbye. as i walk down the road my ex has caught up with me after she runs to catch up with me. she says she has done this to tell me thatuy who has a family that makes her laugh, feel alive. this guy has a child. i recognise him from her xmas party. i'm really confused about why she chased after me. it's obvious she cares but is she feeling guilty, trying to spare my feelings in the hardest time of my life. i do want her back in my life but seeing her with another guy hurt big time. seeing them close to each other eating ice cream. she works with him, did she like him when we were dating. i also hate the idea of her sharing her sympathy and support with other people, especially a guy like that. and it hurts to hear her say to me he's going through a hard time. i'm going through the hardest time of my life. i feel like i can't use her as a crutch. i'm so confused, hurt, a mess. i bury my best friend tomorrow . i am absolutely terrified. i feel sick, like i'm going to mess up and ruin everything. the last 2 months has been the worst of my life, it just has. i want things to be better. i want him back. i want her back. i feel terrible."
adhd,bipolar,16,so tonight i was setting out my meds for tomorrow morning on my napkin while drinking a cup of water and i..... you guessed it...... took my meds. i tried to f so yeah.... i have to wake up in 3 hours and 20 minutes and i am nowhere near tired. &amp;#x200b; tl;dr don't drink anything while setting out your meds my guy
depression,anxiety,18,"you want certian people to always be there for you but they just can't be. they're busy and have their own lives. or maybe they just don't understand how much you're going througlly maybe showed concern for my well being. i just want to spend time with someone my age who actually also wants to hangout with me, and not just me wanting to hangout with them."
anxiety,adhd,25,"i can't sit still when i get my eyebrows done, and when i'm in class i usually doodle to focus. i pay attention very well in school regardless of that, and drawing helps me focus."
depression,anxiety,27,"it's really silly, but i need to walk one egg a day, do one raid and get 10'000xp. that's the only freaking thing i can get done in a day. it has no value, but at least it's something."
bipolar,anxiety,28,"i have no motivation to do anything. i don’t go to my one online class, i don’t get off of my couch except for when my dog needs me to, i can’t clean, i can’t do the laundry, my dishes are piling up, and i still can’t make myself get off of this couch. how do y’all push through? what are little things you do to get out of this?"
bipolar,depression,32,"does anyone get in depressions so low that you feel like you are practically evil from all the guilt and stuff that you feel? i have serious mood episodes with my hormones/periods, for example, and can go from a littlerld feels dark and closing in. i don't even want help at these points, because i ""know"" i do not deserve it. just wondering who else experiences this and what can be done to keep yourself somewhat grounded or something."
bipolar,anxiety,33,"i started new meds a few weeks ago, and i think i found a good combination that works for me. i don't wake up wishing i was dead, i don't get irritable as much and i can go out in public without becoming super anxious. it's been harder to fall asleep and i have a few other small side effects, but they're not terrible. it's just nice to not be in a terrible mood 24/7. i hope others can find medications that work for them too!"
ptsd,anxiety,43,"my lovely husband came home tonight and i have just triggered off him big time. i want to punch his face in. seriously he hasn’t done anything other than talk to me about upgrading a computer. i’m scared and angry and just want to attack him both physically and verbally. [fightause this, he hasn’t done anything wrong. i let him know i needed some space. then i wrote this! it feels good to get these thoughts out. thanks for listening. it would help me to know i’m not the only one that feels like this. hope it helps you if you have experienced this too."
ptsd,adhd,46,"so, just to add a bit of backstory, i am diagnosed with complex ptsd, ocd, adhd, major depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. i have a fairly severe history of trauma, and a habit of using dissociation to cope since i was a young child. i was also in the hospital for a little bit in march, after ruthless flashbacks made me extremely  so nervous. i don’t know exactly what i want to come of this post, but i just need support, i guess. my family doesn’t understand at all, and the fact that none of them take half an hour to read up on it to try to understand really hurts me. as a result, i don’t have a very good support system at all. thank you for even taking the time to read this."
anxiety,depression,49,i feel drained and exhausted. every day. even when i exercise. i'm so lonely but no one ever hangs out with me or talks with me. most of my friends left and now i'm back to where i started. :/ i feel guilty to and idk why. i've never experienced this type of sadness before
bipolar,ptsd,52,"do any of you have or had trouble taking responsibility for things? i'm 30 years old and feeling like i'm just now understanding my part in all the bad (and good) parts of my life. i recently realized how i treated my exes and the head games i played. i always thought ""head games"" we're intentional and this discovery has helped me forgive others because i don't think some of them meant to either. my last relationship had a lot of m i'm not diagnosed, i believe i have boarder line personality disorder. both of my more recent exes have told me i am abusive in my own ways (usually emotionally distant when needed but full on dependent during my own constant crises.) it's a damn shame i put so many men through hell without even taking their emotions seriously. anyway, those who share their problems with the blame game: do you have any suggestions? books? anything?"
adhd,depression,55,"seriously. i never realized other people struggled with as many of the same things that i struggle with. finding this community helped me realize that i'm not alone, and helped me better understand my mental illness. i am so grateful."
ptsd,anxiety,59,"it’s ironic and frustrating, because i spend 99% of the time hyper-vigilant and on edge, but when i’m in a situation that actually could be dangerous, suddenly i beco that i shouldn’t have, and potentially seriously endangered myself. i never realize what happened until i look back on it afterwards and i feel like a complete idiot."
bipolar,adhd,61,"lately i've been having this issue with how time passes. i don't seem to feel it pass. like it's ten thirty pm for me right now, and i don't feel like a day has passed. i haven't been doing anything absorbing wween setting it and the alarm. it's kind of a problem. i don't seem to realize that i'm wasting as much as i am because time doesn't register at all. has anyone else experienced this? is there anything i can do?"
none,ptsd,66,most people get relased after 14 years or earlier after commiting brutal crimes like murder . but here is a man who spent 54 years in prison without committing a crime and without facing a trial . the entire system is a joke. god knows how many such people are still in the prsion.
ptsd,anxiety,72,"i hate this disorder, i hate the people who did this to me, i hate the holidays, i hate knowing that no one is ever really going to actually care. when it comes down to it they just really don't. if i have to be so fucking lonely with this pain then i would rather just actually be alone then. i hate all of this."
ptsd,bipolar,81,i've had them for several years and i'm passed getting suicidal/etc but it just gets really hard to breath and always ends up disabling me for a good few hours. obviously i know what's happening and that it will pass but i just need advice that will help it pass faster. i have 2 jobs and they are setting me back time wise so much and i'm just really frustrated.
bipolar,adhd,83,"third week of school. one class has an attendance policy of forfeiting all attendance points if you miss more than two classes. i mean, attendance is 40/420 pts so it could be worse. i guess. just gotta blow them away with my assignments... i’ll start by drinking this bottle of vodka. fall 2019 is not going as planned."
ptsd,bipolar,84,"not all that unusual where i work actually. the supervisor i broke down in front of had his own breakdown about 8 years ago. its an engineering company that specializes in large, high risk sort of projects. so lots of crazy hours and stress. without realizing it, i went something like a week without sleep. i was supposeannot be on most meds), and various other things. nope....i get a couple of emails detailing the online videos i have to watch. ""sexual harassment: always a bad touch"", ""work place violence: serpentine to success"", ""msds and you"", along with ""export proprietary controls for intellectual property"" our hr department sucks."
ptsd,adhd,86,"i'm diagnosed with schizophrenia, but psychiatrists also tried out adhd, aspergers/autism, dissociative identity disorder, anxiety, major depression, etc etc you get the picture. my psychiatrist is now convinced that i have ptsd, and whether or not he's right about that, there is something traumatic in my past that caused me a lot of pain and coincided with suicide attempts and illicit drug use. but i don't know what happened. i'm generally aware that my family life wasn't good growing up, i know i was unhappy as a kid, but most of what i ""remember"" from earlier than 18 is actse the moment i try to relax, i lose control of my emotions. even mundane memories of walking to school or what my bedroom looked like sends me into a panic or makes me feel like i'm about to cry and throw up. i feel so disgusting and awful anytime i touch any memory from earlier than 18. i know that i couldn't handle it when it happened, and i feel like it'd just destroy me again if i remembered. but this is clearly still affecting me in terms of anxiety and stress, and i can't fix those until i fix the cause. what if trying to fix this just sends me spiralling out of control?"
ptsd,bipolar,95,i have a gf of a month and a half and i like her a lot but it’s getting slightly more serious and i’m scared it’s just going to get to the point my relationships normally di don’t know i just feel like a bad person for not ever falling in love the way everyone else describes it even with my (now ex) girlfriend of two years. does anyone relate?
adhd,anxiety,96,"i recently learnt that executive dysfunction can be broken down into two main categories: anxiety that your attempt won't be satisfactory, or confusion about where to start or how to break it down into steps. as much as we feel bad about it, it's extremely important to remember that it is not laziness and we in fact shouldn't feel bad."
none,adhd,97,"yesterday, me and my girlfriend, both 22 were in my car waiting for my girlfriend's driver to come pick her up right in front of her college at around 2pm. while being there for just a few minutes, watching music videos on youtube and showing absolutely no pda (not even holding hands), a policeman arrives on his motorbike and in a very aggressive and threatening way demanded me to get outside with an obvious intention of arresting/ slapping(?) me. i repeatedly e told me to flee off. what's the right approach of dealing with such a scenario since i obviously don't want our names in any kind of police records, neither do i want to include our parents into this as her parents still don't know about us! neither do i wana get myself slapped in public for nothing wrong. could they just falsely blame us for anything petty and make a case out of it, as i'm well aware public obscenity is illegal. by the way, this was in delhi."
none,adhd,104,"as a person who's colorblind, it's damn near impossible to see if shuffle is activated, especially on my phone. adding a circle around the shuffle symbol when is on would make it easier for all of us."
adhd,bipolar,105,"you know how sometimes you'll just remember something in the past you did and cringe at yourself and its like, kinda physically painful? that's the feeling i'm talking about. for most people it just kinda comes and goes and they are fine bearing it for a moment, however i seem to either be hypersensitive to the feeling or just really bad at regulating it (probably a bit of both tbh), as half the time ""i wanna punch myself"" doesn't stop at just being a descriptor of how and feel and ends up being a bit of how i cope with it til it passes :/ i'll end up hitting myself on my leg or arm or something or punching a nearby wall as a way to relieve the tension, never hard enough to leave a lasting mark but often enough to be worrisome. i know it's not healthy but i don't know what else to do cuz the feeling is otherwise ui'll end up having a panic attack, yet i pretty much never actively avoid possible triggers and even signed up for my school's improv and dance clubs completely out of my own freewill (actually participating, however, is a different matter). basically, never happens to me lol. does anyone have any advice on better ways to cope with the cringe feelings, or with just emotional regulation in general? i'm on ritalin ir rn and while it does seem to help a bit, the problem is still very present, especially later in the evening or at night where i'm more tired and the meds have worn off. **tl;dr i have general emotional regulation problems and specifically always end up coping with ""cringe"" feelings with self harm. does anyone have advice on healthier ways to cope or other general help with emotional regulation?** thanks!"
bipolar,depression,107,"i can’t sleep because my thoughts are racing, but i’m highly depressed and want to crawl into a hole. i had a few real low days last week and took off work - couldn’t sleep enough! the past 48 hours, though, i feel like i can’t sleep even a solid 20 minutes straight. yet i want to puke and curl up into a ball and just pick my skin excessively. just venting...."
none,ptsd,108,"front line workers infected and left without any care. people swarming the streets looking for beds in hospitals, only to be turned away, due to lack of beds or lack of other resources. testing kits not available, and those available faulty. all in all, the pot is filled to brim and will overflow any time. it’s only a matter of time before most of the population gets infected. tragedy is, there’s no one to look after those affected."
anxiety,adhd,109,"whenever i sit at my desk i think of all the things i enjoy doing / should be doing (which includes hobbies) like reading, writing, journaling, studying language, and i am paralyzed by the decision. i try and weigh it up by things like 'well i ing done, and don't enjoy it. i'm too worried of making the 'wrong' choice. i have to keep reminding myself to stop prevaricating and just pick one and who cares about weighing factors or making practical choices. just choose one! but it's hard."
bipolar,anxiety,110,i don’t know if this is a common symptom with other people but i swear sometimes i feel like i mix up my words and i can’t talk right with my medication. does anyone else experience this?
adhd,anxiety,112,"also, stop procrastinating on reddit. is there a small first step of something that you should be doing right now? go do it. wait. no. don't read ""just one more post."" go directly from this to the thing you're dreading. just do 60 seconds of something productive towards it. feel better? keep going. you got this :)"
adhd,none,124,"i often have people bring up songs/albums/bands or movies/tv shows during conversation. they might say, ""have you seen or heard x?"" and if i have i will say ""yeah, i liked it, enjoyed it etc etc etc"". however,lsive liar who says they like things just to fit in when in reality i just cannot remember many details, lines, names or lyrics, just i enjoyed said movie/show/album etc. anyone else get this? feelsbadman.jpeg."
depression,anxiety,126,"i feel like i almost get some weird sense of satisfaction when i'm in a cycle of self loathing. i don't feel happy during it, but there's something addicting about having that nasty inner critic voice just shit on me and my seld any resistance to it feels straining and requires a lot of mental effort. tl;dr anyone else feel a sense of catharsis when you have a spiral of negative thoughts of yourself? any tips for getting out of that cycle of thoughts?"

ptsd,depression,139,"this week has been god awful, but finding this sub and being able to relate / not feel so alone is really helpful and i’m really happy that this community exists."
ptsd,bipolar,140,"i’m incredibly nervous but i’ve decided to try some medical marijuana this week. maybe next if i chicken out. something has to change. i feel like i’ve been doing whatever i can for the last two decades and plateaued with my health in the last four years or so. my medication, support system, physical activity level, and therapy are helpful but i still feel very frostrain is tailored to my issues and i trust my “bud tender” but am terrified to lose control. but i think it could be the best type of exposure therapy for me. obviously my greatest fear is losing control but having a mild experience with some mj and facing it could be helpful. or it could be really, really bad. anyone relate to this or have tried anything similar ?"
anxiety,depression,141,"i thought i was having a great time being myself and having fun but now, afterwards, i regret everything i did and said. i hate myself for how i acted and what i must have looked like. i want comfort and reassurance, but i am alon feel like every part of you is just screaming for a sign of love but even if you saw it, you wouldn't understand it. thanks for being here with me, for having a broken heart with me, and wishing for just a little bit more with me."
ptsd,depression,142,"outside of my husband and my mother in law, i have no one. i work from home so, no coworkers. i go grocery shopping and can do things outside the house if i need to so it’s not severe social anxiety or agoraphobia. i can have a conversation and i’m pleasink about me, or know me. i’ve even told my husband that if i die before him, please don’t have a funeral for me because i don’t even want anyone to know i’ve died, if at all possible. anyone else find themselves totally and completely okay with solitude?"
depression,bipolar,147,"now that i've struggles with this bullshit for 7 years, i've come to the realisation that literally no one cares no one is genuinely there for you. everyone will claim to be there for you and beg you to open up to them because they want to be the hero who 'saves'd because you just can't quite bring yourself to talk to people. going through days of mania followed by weeks of lowness and having people expect you to be okay because of those few days of mania everyone wants to be there for you until you actually show symptoms"

depression,anxiety,151,"i'm pretty sure it's the only thing that's keeping me alive, maybe not alive, but wanting to occasionally live. it's an escape, whether playing or listening. i'm glad i have it, but it's also scary to be so reliant on it. i do recordings and write songs, i guess it gives me a sort of purpose. if i do leave, i'll have something that people can look at and listen to as a reminder that i was maybe okay at something in my life."
none,depression,162,"at 14 years old he saw his beloved grandma get shredded with bullets by the man he used to play with. at 21 his father was blown up by terrorists. he didnt even get to see his father's body one last time. deaths are never good. people always get hurt for life and some take a lifetimrage because when you take out the political figure out of him, he is a person who suffered too much too early in his life. something most of us will never or never did suffer in life. i dont support congress, but lets not insult or let neech aadmi's insult and hurt those soft spots."
anxiety,adhd,163,"(in informal settings when there is sun obviously.) it has happened a few times when i was out with friends on sunny days, sitting in the shade outside of a restaurant or cafe. it was not really that neccesary to leave my sunglasses okeep a conversation going smoothly. wearing sunglasses prevents this somehow. also in turn: i find it very rude of people to just demand someone to take off their sunglasses for your convenience. feels belittleling somehow. thoughts???"
adhd,depression,165,"i get really excited about an idea or something and im motivated about it . when it comes time to apply to it (job, student org), i get depressed and don't do well. then afterwards i regret. i keep getting rejected from everything. i'm really fucking upset and the people around me are really fucking tired of hearing me cry all the time. anyone else feel this way"

anxiety,ptsd,168,"""the evening is a time to be calm,"" they said.

ptsd,anxiety,169,"i would like to know if you might have some advice for this. i've never talked about what happened whit him but he knows that there is something wrorng because i often panick with him. he has a lot of respect for my silence but i really feel the need to talk. i've never done this and even if i want to do it, when he ask me if i want to explain him what happened i just say that i don't know what to say. how do you open up to someone? are there some things that make it easier?"
depression,adhd,170,i pretty much don't know where to go at this point. i keep telling myself things could always be worse and then things actually get worse and so i just repeat that phrase ad infinitum. lately it seems like the big man upstairs has it out for me. edit: holy butts this blew up. i'm overwhelmed with all the love people are showing. i'll try and answer all of you.
bipolar,depression,173,"i was hospitalized over a week ago for a suicide attempt. since i've been on around 30 different meds without much results, i requested etc (electro convulsive therapy) since they did it at the hospital i was in. i got three rounds of treatment and my depression has been zapped out of my brain. i feel so much better. just had to share. :)"
ptsd,anxiety,174,"it may be bizarre to say this but ... i cannot think, i cannot feel, i cannot do anything because i am too scared to do anything because i cannot trust anyone because i feel that i am living among a world of sharks, just like in the world of game of thrones. i aood people out there and i applaud you for that but just like in the world of game of thrones, the good people always lose because is a messy, messy place that is filled and made up of lies and dirty work because somehow humanity is inherently evil, to this point"
none,bipolar,189,i heard the expression before and seems kinda understandable like it's am onomatopoeia or like it really has the feeling it tries to mean... it's like a shivery cringey thing as far as how i understand... could you please correct me if i'm wrong?
bipolar,adhd,193,"i'm just so god damn bored. everyone is congratulating me for doing so well, for finally having my shit together... and i'm so fucking bored. i can feel myself slipping. i did coke for the first time in a long, long time the other week (a very tiny amount), and i haven't been able to think about ogether). i'm currently not working because i saved alot so i didn't have to work over the summer, so i have a fair amount of money in my account, but it needs to last me months. all i want to do at the moment is book a flight and leave. i'm so hopelessly bored and i don't really know what to do."
ptsd,depression,197,"i have this regularly and destroyed my social life once again a while back. i pushed away all people i love and lost basically every human connection. i feel like i'd just justify my behavio me. i don't think it's ever going to be any other way, so i don't care anymore. i'm starting to think that i should stay in this totally emotionless state just to stop hurting my loved ones."
anxiety,depression,200,"i just noticed this a couple of days ago when i was messaging back and forth with my boyfriend the whole day. i had just finished volunteering at a crisis hotline and we we were talking about how i needed a recommendation letter from them for my social work degree program and he was saying ""it sounds like an intense program, but if anyone can do it it's my hat said ""he's going to break up with you way before that."" yesterday my boyfriend got way into this new game he got and he wasn't really paying attention to me or anyone or anything else really which just made more of those negative thoughts pop into my head like he doesn't love me. it was so bad that i couldn't sleep last night. i just need advice i guess."

depression,bipolar,203,i've been in a major depressive episode for the last two years or so and lately i find myself only brushing my teeth maybe once a day and showering only once a week. i was just wondering if anyone else struggles with this at different times during a depressive episode.
bipolar,anxiety,205,"if you don't tell anyone about hallucinations, you lay in bed until everyone in the house is asleep before getting back up, not posting on social media after 9 and before 5am, keeping my fool mouth shut in public, avoid road rage by not driving like it's a race, don't go rogue on my husband with hypersexual tendencies, you might appear half way normal, right? how do you all fake normal? i need more tips."
ptsd,anxiety,207,"was scrolling through twitter earlier and saw a video of two girlfriends talking and one was stroking the other’s hair and holding her hand and i just,, started crying because i ver want to touch my skin or my body in a kind way. has anyone else ever experienced something like this? sorry if i’ve done anything wrong, it’s my first time posting in this sub"
adhd,bipolar,209,"it took me a year and a half to *finally* get diagnosed and start treatment for something i’ve had for 18+ years of my life. i have to go through a really inconvenient process to get my medication. i have to call my psychiatrist, pray to god he’s in the office, get a new prescription every time, drive 40 minutes out of my way to get a paper copy of my prescription, bring it to the pharmacy and wait another 30 minutes while they process it, ano give you my medication that i *need* just because you’re *actually* just lazy and/or want to get high. buy it from someone else. don’t take advantage of my kindness and my mental illness. you are the reason why it took me a year and a half to get diagnosed. you are the reason we don’t get taken seriously. you are the reason why some people think i’m just some junkie. you are the problem. rant over. ugh. sorry. i had to get that off my chest."
ptsd,anxiety,216,"i only feel comfortable communicating with people who have some sort of serious mental health issue themselves as well, or are professionals in the field, thus very understanding. i am so tired of being lonely and limited in my abilities to make connections with people."

adhd,bipolar,232,meaning you get a sudden clarity of how differently you behave while medicated. i had realized how helpful the medication is when i forgot to take it one day and it was a massive cluster fuck
bipolar,adhd,239,"i'm just curious to see if this happens to anyone else; the title is pretty self explanatory. (tl;dr at bottom) i don't mean like i'm ""out of it"" or even just fatigued for the day and my brain loses its train of thought one too many times. i feel like that happens to everyone at least once in a while (including myself). i mean like it takes an insane amount of mental energy for me to say a sentence from start to finish correctly, usually takes me a few tries to do so. so to say a 3 sentence response to somethiow to speak in general. anyone else have similar experiences? tl;dr: does anyone sometimes find their speech to be very impaired, like you feel as if you forgot how to speak at all? maybe due to an episode, personal issues, both, etc? edit: thank you so much everyone who replied to this post, sharing your experiences and such. one of my biggest insecurities is my speech (due to the issue mentioned in this post) and it's so comforting to have so much nice, supportive feedback and to know i'm not alone on this :)"

ptsd,depression,258,im so happy man. i was kinda a dumb teenager who figured i could “do it myself” but now as a adult i know i can’t do that so i’m super excited to be getting help. ahhhhhh
bipolar,depression,268,i love how easy it is to go from not giving one shit about what other people think to giving all the shits. the paranoia that people are talking about me.t thought i really was just a horrible person. at least now i know that i just have a broken brain and not just a completely broken/ defective as a person.
bipolar,none,273,"[my last so i asked for some useful website ideas i could build for our community here and i got a few awesome replies that i’ve taken under consideration. my main goal here is to build something that people (especially newcomers) will actually use. **i want it to be a place of happy, positive and organized information.** /u/fitsofthefather suggested building a section of medication and treatment related info that’s backed by research and studies. i want to hold off on that fidence boosting scripts that you can recite to yourself in times of need. it seems like a lot, but it’ll fit into one website. my only question is would it benefit this community and do you see it being useful? if so, i will need a few people to consult regarding information for the website and if anyone wants a place to blog you’re welcome to blog here! everything will be anonymous unless you want otherwise. thanks everyone. edit: thanks so much to /u/tosher23 for the gold!"

bipolar,anxiety,301,i got a cat almost a month ago. i got him because cats have been shown to help with anxiety. his favorite thing to do was to lay on my chest and purr while knocking my phone out of my hand to have me pet him. i lookedour ago. i don't understand how life has given me this many hardships in my life and especially 2 days before my birthday. all i wanted to do was spend it with him. i really do not know what to do. i'm just really sad.

bipolar,adhd,304,i promised a friend i'd make a poster and a pin the tail on the donkey game for his kid's birthday. then i forgot - because my own kid had a school project that i threw all my free time this week into. i remembered thursday at work abofeel stupid for this. i also had a twelve hour work day yesterday and it's a job that requires tons of running. i hope they're happy with it all. if they're not... i guess i'll just have to accept that and know that i gave it my best!!!

depression,anxiety,312,"people only think about themselves. your own pain doesnt matter, its just the pain for others, mentally healthy people they want to avoid. please dont confuse this with people who dont commit suicide because of other people - this is not what i am talking about. trying to push through by thinking about others is completely different than telling someone that their pain doesnt matter or matters less than the pain of others. imagine going to the doctor because of a broken leg and they tell you that you shouldn't have broken your leg because now people will have to helpheir pain, about their suffering, their fear. everyone is so quick to say ""oh yes mental illnesses are real ofc"" but when they are confronted with it they are ignorant. i dont think you can always keep going because of others. one day it will be too much. you need to put yourself first sometimes. the title might be misleading because you can say it - if its clear that this is not the only reason to not end your life and that your pain matters, but i cant write an essay in the title and i hardly ever heard someone say it without the worst judgement in their voice so..."

none,depression,364,"hey guys, so i had a little check up in class in which i got 7/10 points. i wanted to ask if the 3 points i wasn't given are justified. 1. we should translate the german equivalent for ""when someone is sick and he makes the transition from being into working life to being on sick leave"" into english. i wrote ""to go into sick leave"". hkes enough money to live, from doing something"" i wrote: ""make a living out of something"". when i asked my teacher about it she just gave me a weird look and told me that i had apparently used the wrong preposition, she said it's to be ""make a living from something"". i am convinced that both are possible. tell me reddit, what's right?"
ptsd,bipolar,370,"tw : re sub about drunk rape someone posted recently in an “unpopular “ opinion sub that essentially if two people who are drunk have sex, it shouldn’t be considered rape, because they’re both drunk. i foolishly decided to read the opinions thinknd i’ve only told a handful of people, so it really throws me for a loop when i’m moved to the point of tears over a dumb opinion. i guess i’m just looking for some validation from people who have been similarly upset by seemingly innocuous posts."
adhd,bipolar,371,i have an issue with balance. i never know when i'm on the path to burnout until i get there because i don't know how to differentiate between pushing through for discipline or pushing myself past my limits. does that make sense? does anyone have advice?

ptsd,anxiety,380,"like it says, something feels wrong. i can taste in my mouth that something isn't right. it's as if i'm looking at everything through a different light, like my mind is seperate  screamed throughout my head. i can feel in my chest that something is wrong, it's not anxiety, it's my heart pumping so loud. it feels like something very bad is about to happen."

ptsd,bipolar,384,i really need some support i’m feeling over the edge semi suicidal because i feel like i’m failing at everything. i can’t even make friends. maybe i am just a bad person. maybe everything my ex ever said was true. i just feel like such a failure and just have no enthusiasm to keep fighting. need some encouragement. i have no one.
anxiety,none,392,"felt horrible when i read the news, with the fears that many have about potential war. although i live in australia, i’m still scared about the outcomes. speaking to my dad, he reassures me this isn’t a global conflict (china and russia, and other major players being unlikely to join the war). nevertheless, i understand even a war between iran and the us wouldn’t impact me better (what i think my dad does at times, or others in other posts). the rational part of me tells me not to worry about this, as even if it eventuates to my worst fears, i’ll be worrying about it twice. with a pretty important interview in a couple of days, i’m trying to stick that, but not sure how i’ll cope as more news comes out (although i’m making myself keep off it)."
depression,anxiety,395,"which is wack, because we're all a bunch of strangers hiding behind usernames. but this is such a common theme for me. for example, if someone passes me on the freeway, i immediately assume it's because that person is angry at me and wants to run me over. where is this line of thinking coming from? is it anxiety? i've been depressed for 13 years and this ""everybody hates me empirically"" has only surfaced in the last 1-2 years. anyone else deal with this?"
adhd,anxiety,402,"not once did i believe i'd be able to make it through. i had come up with backup plans at least 4 times in preparation for the inevitable point i'd be asked to leave or fail out. turns out i was wroion or an entire school program, or maybe even just reading a book, you can do it. we all can. this disorder doesn't have to define us. thanks to everyone here for being so supportive, you guys rock."

anxiety,ptsd,417,"i have a few things bothering me a lot at the moment and very much need some serious advice. when i was 4/5, i was sitting on my dad's lap helping him steer a car into the back yard, i suddenly felt something hard against my backside, he then asked if i could feel it, and i said yes, we then got out of the car. my mum then asks why he had an erection, he tells mum that i was sitting on his lap. she then starts to get jealous and asks what was wrong with her, and they have a small argument before she walks inside, leaving me alone with him. he then asks me to come towards him, win the mirror (which was located directly in front of the mirror), or to just have a chat because he hadn't seen me all day. i would complain to my mum everyday, and she would just say she would talk to him, or even said that i always showered while he was home so i must want him to look at me. these memories have been causing me a great deal of stress, but i'm confused about if they're serious, and if i should be worried about them? i have two young daughters myself now, and i'm worried about their safety around my parents. am i overreacting or do i have something to worry about?"
bipolar,depression,418,i’m singing everything and forcing myself to not sing on my conference calls. at least this is a feel good one! i almost want to decorate for christmas while i should be working but i know i have stuff i need to do.
bipolar,ptsd,446,"so in the title, within quotation marks, are what i've heard from people i spent the most time with. 1) my mom, 2) a now-ex boyfriend, and 3) a former friend. 1) my mom kinda blew up in the parking lot of a hospital. the doctor said i didn't need a cough pill for my infection, and would be fine with only the prescription she gave me, and then my mom asked if she could prescribe me with a cough syrup. the doctor agreed to prescribe a strong cough syrup, and i asked if i don't need a cough pill, ""do i need cough syrup?"" the doctor said no, but said ""the medicines won't react with one another,"" and ""if you want a cough syrup, i can prescribe one."" *but i don't.* my cough won't go away (respitory infection) until the steroids kick in, but it will go away. i don't like taking meds i don't need. i'm defensive about this, because every time i have respitory issues, my mom asks the doc for a cough syrup ""for my own good"" and i feel like shit bc it's got some depressive drug in it, and i feel ultra sluggish the morning after i take it. i don't need it so i'm adverse to taking it. my mom says it's ridiculous that i have a cough and won't take a cough syrup, when no cough syrup was prescribed or suggested. the steroids will take it's course. but mothers will be mothers. i just hate taking drugs i don't actually need. (and i'm 18 so i'd think the doctor would have asked me first. guess not.) anyway she called me ungrateful and wouldn't let me speak and i dunno. it hit me. she said: ""i'm better off dead than i am alive to you, because nothing i do as your mother makes you happy."" i wanted to shoot myself in the mouth right there and then, ngl. i know that isn't the (logical) answer to this, but she isn't the only one who's said stuff like this. 2) my ldr boyfriend of two years broke up with me last night. he says he doesn't feel like he can talk to me, because he says offhanded things, and for a while, i didn't address them until months later (which is toxic). and now he feels that he'll fuck up no matter what he does, so what's the point. in the past i've addressed things as they came up and he either made fun of me, got super defensive, or asked ""so what's the problem?"". for example: he didn't speak to me for long periods of time. for like. a year. cancelled majority of skype dates at the last second. i said that i knew he has other obligations, but that still felt a bit emotionally neglected. (being left on read for days and sometimes weeks, not hearing from him for months, reading an ""i love you, too"" from him was rare. i felt like he didn't like me.) but he said that i had no reason to believe that. he had a roommate who made me cry, and he didn't defend me. even if i say that i didn't appreciate a comment, he would just join him. of course, he didn't mean to be rude, and of course he didn't mean to overlook my crying, didn't mean to misunderstand me. but he refused to buy earbuds because of his ""indispoable income"" (even if he went out to drink once a month). which gave his roommate ammo to be a bully. so i mailed my then-bf earbuds and he lost them. it felt as if he didn't put any effort into the relationship, and was justifying himself. when i asked if he wanted to break up, he sounded surprised and confused as to why. said that he loves me. i wasn't angry, just hurt and confused with all the mixed messages. but i said i believed him and ignored my gut. plus, on holidays, he drives six hundred miles in one go to visit me (and his family. so contrary to what he says, i'm not the only reason he comes to the city i live in.) but he said ""you think i wanna see my family? barely anyone there wants to see me. i'm driving for nine hours straight just so see you. of course i love you."" he gave multiple examples of his responsibilities, asked if i understood, and still asked what the problem is. i couldn't teents to me and to other people. i understand how depression can be; but that doesn't excuse her from being mean. from playing rough and with scissors (as a seventeen year old). from going out of her way to patronize people. but she put on her snapchat story her suicidal thoughts, talking about how everyone she knows is against her. so i swiped up, let her know that i apologize if i wronged her, and that i want her to be okay. that i don't think anyone is against her. that i am here if she needs to talk. she said that i can't make her pity me, and i was baffled. that she doesn't have the energy for my bullshit. (yikes.) that i shouldn't play nice if i don't feel nicely about a person. (still don't know what's she was talking about but it was childish. but still yikes.) and then she said all i do is complain about my family problems and boyfriend and do nothing to fix it. (that was when i said ""good to know,"" and blocked her. hehe.) it's so funny that she *asked me* what's wrong, didn't accept ""nothing"" for an answer, and then secretly hated when i was open and honest. i thought she was my friend. but i guess only therapists are meant to hear your problems. anyway. i digress. days after i blocked her, she came around me in person. went out of her way to sit next to me. acted fearful, as if i would reject her. took every single chance she got to be overly nice. for example: i was presenting and the class (of 13 people) was talking over me. she stood up, cupped both hands over her mouth, and projected: ""everyone! chris is talking! it is important to hear what they say, so that they can finish their presentation!"" sat down, then grinned at me. the class had the same weirded-out expression as i did. like. ugh. that was so artificial that it hurt me. i have a floridan friend who i tell some of these situations with, and he says it sounds like the other person has some unsolved problems of their own. my therapist said the same thing about all three scenarios. that nothing i complain about is like. ""i'm so sad my dad got me a blue car. i wanted a red one."" y'know? like the problems that bother me are literally ""so i'm homeless and don't know where i'm sleeping tonight "" or ""i got 27 spider bites in my sleep"" or ""my mom is threatening to kick me out and i'm an unemployed student"" or something that can't be given advice, because it's totally out of anyone's control. like when my car got totalled and i kept having flashbacks about the crash throughout the day. i couldn't sleep at night. for weeks. or when three of my classmates died. or when i was in a sexually abusive relationship for six months, got assaulted everyday on school grounds, and didn't tell anyone for eight months. i have flashbacks and awful dreams about *that* one to this day. but i don't say anything until someone asks me what's wrong. and even if they do, i'm reluctant to say so. bc none of this can be hugged better. it's heavy. it's uncomfortable and nobody wants to hear it. those are the only things that get to me. those are the things i go to therapy for. but my therapist doesn't believe in dwelling on (talking about) past traumas and griefs. i don't know what anyone wants me to do anymore. do i just let go of *everything*? i do not exagerrate; these things happened in the same twelve months. i'm not trying to excuse my complaints, but, yikes. i don't know what to make of any of this. anyway. tldr: nobody i open up to stick around. are all of these situations like. situations where both parties have made acceptable mistakes in handling their situation? or am i this unhappy person who makes people miserable because i complain so much? am i ungrateful? am i being crazy for saying the things i do? does anyone else hear statements like these from people who see you the most? it's times like these that makes self destructive behavior so easy."
adhd,anxiety,447,"every time i get into an argument/ debate i’m either a second away from crying or a second away from an angry outburst. it’s so hard to keep my cool and as a result... i learned to stop talking/ people please/ avoid the topic whenever thin the rest of the day because i feel like i’ve been rejected. everytime i feel rejected i suddenly think everyone is going to abandon me, and i get stuck in that feeling. i’m learning slowly and taking my time... but god does this shit suck!"

bipolar,depression,593,"came across this and thought they may be useful for anyone suffering from mild depression: does anyone religiously do cbt and if so did it help? **common cognitive distortions** a partial list from robert l. leahy, stephen j. f. holland, and lata k. mcginn’s [*treatment plans and interventions for depression and anxiety disorders*] (2012) 1. **mind reading** you assume that you know what people think without having sufficient evidence of their thoughts. “he thinks i’m a loser.” 2. **fortune-telling** you predict the future negatively: things will get worse, or there is danger ahead. “i’ll fail that exam,” or “i won’t get the job.” 3. **catastrophizing** you believe that what has happened or will happen will be so awful and unbearable that you won’t be able to stand i feel now,” or “my parents caused all my problems.” 10. **what if?** you keep asking a series of questions about “what if” something happens, and you fail to be satisfied with any of the answers. “yeah, but what if i get anxious?,” or “what if i can’t catch my breath?” 11. **emotional reasoning** you let your feelings guide your interpretation of reality. “i feel depressed; therefore, my marriage is not working out.” 12. **inability to disconfirm** you reject any evidence or arguments that might contradict your negative thoughts. for example, when you have the thought i’m unlovable, you reject as irrelevant any evidence that people like you. consequently, your thought cannot be refuted. “that’s not the real issue. there are deeper problems. there are other factors.”"
none,adhd,595,"you see a lot of folk in here posing a question something along the lines of: ""if i take a year or two off to travel, how will this affect my future career?"" and many of the answers people offer up are absolute bs, mostly self-fulfilling drivel meant to rationalize their own life choices. so while many will disagree (this is the internet, after all), here is the actual truth about how long-term travel will affect your resume/career. **what will employers think when they see the gap in my resume?** they'll hate it. you may get lucky with that one in a hundred diamond in the rough but overall taking serious time off to travel is seen as a bad thing by any business in the pursuit of profit. can you spin your time overseas to look ""better"" in the eyes of an employer? absolutely. can you leverage the language skills, problem solving skills and social skills you picked up on your trip? absolutely. can you still get a job in your field when you get back? absolutely. but don't delude yourself into thinking any hiring manager actually prefers to see a one-year roere's a different life out there. so many people seem to want it all...travel for months on end and still build their career. while a very minute percentage of people can pull off the double-whammy, most don't....so it's up to you to make a choice about what's more important to you: maximize career success or gather life experiences. for me i can't fathom a life that doesn't involve travel and adventure as the core goal....but there's no doubt that in terms of dollars and cents i am way, way behind pretty much every one of my friends in terms of earnings, retirement savings, etc. so yeah, it may be the right choice for you to throw all caution to the wind...but don't fall into the trap of actually believing it's ""good"" for your career because it's not. it is, however, good for your soul. it really depends on what's important to you...and that's not a judgment call where travel is right and career is wrong but to an extent you do need to make a proper choice and run with it. edit: i should have specified that this post is very geared towards north america."

(this will be kinda rambly) i was diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety disorder after i checked into a psychiatric hospital a few years back, but i always felt as i grew up that something was wrong. when i went to go meet my biological mother (who is very bipolar) when i was 18 things started to click with me that i needed to figure out a way to find meaning. it didn't help that my step-mom was an abusive cunt. so overall i kinda suck at being a person.(still do) anyways, i've struggled with constantly feeling down, and also feeling a whole lotta shit i didn't really understand. because of this i turned to weed and alcohol when i was 15. went through a few phases of drinking hard, but really weed was my poison of choice(still dont think it's bad but that's for another sub). again anyways because of the plant i kinda regained a sense of what it meant to be a healthy functioning member of society, but it was  pay the rent, things get complicated with family, with work, with life. and all of it together makes me wanna opt out. but then i think of leaving him by himself to deal with it himself and what a living hell that would be. even if i cant do much, ill do what i can till i can't. because if i dont that would make me sadder than anything i can ever encounter in my life. my point is that out there there are strong, amazing, incredibly intelligent and driven people, who do this shit alone. while feeling everything. and its heart breaking. my dad spent his life trying to make me feel welcome when every fiber of my being says i don't belong on this earth. the least i can do is gtfo bed and try to do something. even if my battle that day is just to brush my teeth. so that he can see a good looking smile that he made. to make him feel just a little better. that's my part, my mission. thats what gets me up. there are people that can use your help, and you owe it to them. but that s just my opinion."

bipolar,adhd,625,"my doctor recently decided that she thought i was stable enough to start treating my adhd on top of my bp1. she warned me that the medicine could cause me to have a bad reaction and potentially lead to another psychotic episode or something. she started me on a low dose of vyvance but i didn't feel like it was doing anything and i've gradually gone up to the maximum dose. i've been pretty messed up for about a week now though. i also have pretty bad social anxiety and i think the meds are making me manic or mixed manic. i've been very disconnected from other people., paranoid and socially withdrawn. i havnt left my appartment sense saturday. im havingid because i don't want to get admitted again. she's a new doctor and i don't know how she is about this sort of thing. my last dr seemed like he wanted to try and have me admitted ""for observation"" all the time, even when he wanted to try me on new medicine. that's bullshit though because hospitals are safe places where they remove the stress of the outside world. how can they observe if a medicine is working or not if there aren't any factors at play that would cause an episode. i don't know what to do. i won't go in for an unscheduled appointment. the last time i went to an unscheduled appointment for issues i ended up being admitted against my will"
anxiety,ptsd,627,"my wife passed out from a panic attack yesterday in the theatre while we were watching *a quiet place*. i was so scared and didn't know what to do. about an hour into the movie, there's a scene where someone steps on a nail. it wasn't even very gory, but i guess it triggered some bad memories for her. a few seconds after that scene, my wife's arm started twitching kind of like a seizure. at the same time, she started making sounds like she was snoring or maybe choking. when i looked at her, her head was lolled to the side and her eyes were closed. not realizing what was happening, i nudged her a bit, thinking she had fallen asleep. when her head rolled to the other side and there wasn't any other response my concern sky-rocketed. i took her head in my hands and gently shook her a little bit trying to wake her up. her eyes partially opened, and i could see her pupils were looking up like when you roll your eyes. there was no other response. i tilted her head forward and the ""snoring"" sound stopped, but she was still unconscious. at this point, about half a minute or so had passeder feel safe. i tried to just hold her and comfort her. after about a half hour she was doing better. i felt so helpless when she was unconscious. it's very scary when you suddenly realize your loved one is having a medical emergency. later in the evening, she revealed to me that when she was a teenager, she had an abusive boyfriend that would rape her, cut her with a scalpel, and poke her with needles. sick stuff like that i guess. she wouldn't say much more about it than that. i am angry. not at her, but at the thought some sicko did this to her. and i hurt. i grieve that she has experienced something so traumatic it causes this type of thing. she agreed we will get her into some therapy. she needs healing that i never knew she needed. i also know this isn't about me, but i feel a bit hurt this is just now coming out. we've been married about 5 years, and i never knew this stuff. what else don't i know? i don't know what type of advice i'm looking for. how can i be there for her? how can i help? what do i do if this happens again? did i do the right thing both during and after?"

bipolar,ptsd,967,"i've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, nos, since november 15 2017. my world was turned upside down that day. it's been seven months since, and i've done an incredible amount of reflection and research. how this affected my life up to this point, what i need to do moving forward, and how i need to approach things anew. the most fraught is the topic of bdsm. i have been involved in my local bdsm community for a few years, and i've learned much about safe, sane and consensual, as well as risk aware consensual kink. impact play, rope, sensory deprivation, wax, electric play, fire play... i've had experiences as a dominant and as a submissive, i've fucked up more than once, and i've learned from all of these experiences. but i've also placed myself in harms way. more times, i think, than even i realize. two instances that come to mind are when i impulsively jumped in a cast iron cage and asked to be locked in without designating a dominant, limits, what i wanted to happen, anything like that. i just wanted to fuck around. i scooted myself around the floor \(the cage was on wheels\), undid locks, twiddled with the wheel brakes, did everything i could to just be a nuisance and try to get away. when someone took a cane and started rattling the bars, literally, i tried grabbing at it and was struck on my big toe. reflexively i called ""red"", the 'scene' ended, and i was left with the sordid task of sorting out exactly where i went wrong: i should not have gotten into that cage in the first place. i didn't set up any of the usual safety guards, and i fell into a significant depression after that. it was awful. before that even, i negotiated a scene with a trusted dominant friend of mine. i told him ""i want to go hard, i want to push past my limits."" he started flogging me, i took it, but then i felt an incredible **rage** pushing itself outside of me. i bellowed like a lion, attacked the concrete wall in front of me, tears streaming down my face, so angry so sad so fucking furious so much self hatred. i asked him to hit me as hard as he could with his fists, and...he said no. he hit me, he placed his strikes well, but he immediately started winding down the scene and did not hit me as hard as he could. we've talked about that night many times since, and last night we discussed it again. in short, he suspected that i was bipolar for a while, because of that  but when he suggested knife play, a kink i brought up very early with him, i knew that he felt confidence enough in me to judge me fit to explore this particular kink. and that means a lot to me. i'm safer now. i am seeking and getting the help i need. i'm more readily able to consent now, being of sound\(er\) mind and able to fully, presently grasp everything that is happening and that i am agreeing to, without losing myself to my mind's maelstrom. and i am saner. but i think that goes without saying. the bedrock of what i have always believed in, the foundation of how i try to practice my kink \-\- safe, sane, consensual \-\- is strengthened, and i really feel indebted to my dominant friend, as well as all the others who have taught and coached and reprimanded me in my journey, for keeping me safe while i had less insight than i ever knew into what i was trying to do. i feel a lot of shame and remorse and...anger at myself. for how i may have acted in scenes past, if they didn't go as planned, or if i've acted unpredictably when my senses were notched up to an 11 when submitting. all i can do at this point is express my remorse, hope that the right ears will hear it, try to forgive myself and move forward with the treatment that i so sorely need under my belt. mental health and bdsm are inextricably linked, and though this may be obvious to any serious practicioner, what was not obvious to me was my own complete anosognosia: my lack of insight into my own behavior, feelings, my condition, how it impacted my ability to consent, to reasonably and safely dominate, to give consent as a submissive,... i could have been seriously hurt in my journey, and it's only by the hands, eyes and actions of those who knew better that i have been kept safe when playing with them. and i am really indebted to them for that. this is really an...entire expose of my emotions and my thoughts over the past 24 hours, as so much has poured through my mind since last night, so many reflections and thoughts and observations and self\-judgments... by writing this, i want to let you understand where i'm at and where i hope to go...because despite the rocky road, i've found intimacy and friendship and fun and mastery in my communities, and that's something i will fight to improve myself for. because self care is sexy, but also because it's essential to safe, sane, consensual kink."
depression,bipolar,969,"but it's not as though i violently feel that way. it's just always casually in the back of my mind. for being ""suicidal"" you think it'd be crying on the floor but nah, it's just kinda there. anyone else like this?"
anxiety,adhd,970,"i have this weird situation going on where nearly every morning now, after waking up around 3-4 a.m. i will be half-awake and trying to go back asleep, the problem is, that my mind is constantly telling me, your alarm is about to go off, yorning. i was dreaming that i woke up and checked my phone and a girl replied, so was replaying a scenario of what i was gonna text back, over, and over, and over again. i finally realized that it wasn't actually happening and woke myself up."

bipolar,depression,977,"i was recently pming with someone about relationships, heartbreak, and feeling broken and picked up on a shared sentiment. that our mental illnesses made us less deserving of love from healthy people. which my rational mind tells me is total bullshit, but it's still a sentiment i have to put effort into rejecting. it's no secret i've been investing serious time into online dating, but i think it's progress on my part that most of the time i don't feel like my mental illness disqualifies me from relationships with healthy people. i still feel like i'll be better understood by people who experience depression and whatnot and like my issues will be less of a burden to someone with their own struggles for me to give back to, but as i was thinking abouto more broken than any ""normie."" *how many of you have struggled to feel like it's okay to have relationships with healthy people, and of those of you who have, what if anything has helped you chip away at that feeling?* as broken as i've felt and as flawed as i've been, i've never been broken and i've never stopped being worth loving. there have been things about me that have made it harder to love me, like my former bmi of nearly 40 as a barrier to that kind of attracted attention, but even then i was sometimes shown that kind of love. **however broken you may feel and however unlovable you may feel, you are most certainly mistaken. you are complete and just as flawed as everyone else and worthy of love, however hard it may be to find that love.**"

adhd,anxiety,1366,"just in case anyone isn't aware of what learned helplessness feels like, and as a warning to people not to keep trying the same thing over and over, i've written the following. i will use the term ""brain"" to refer to the unconscious, impulsive parts of the brain, the parts that aren't ""you"", and ""you"" to refer to your conscious experience and rational brain. (disclaimer, this is only my experience, i don't know what other people's experiences are.) --- imagine walking around, going through life, except you don't decide what you do. your brain decides everything for you and you have no say. it wants to play video games, so you play video games. that isn't to say you don't fight it, but on those occasions that you do you either are simply unable to do anything, or every frustration with yourself for every past failure floods upon you, washing your willpower away in a tidal wave of anxiety. you quickly learn the only way to fight is to not fight at all. --- now, imagine somebody calmly tells you, ""i know it's hard, but you really need to just get up and do it. i have no magic bullet unfortunately."" this is nice, they know that you have a hard time ""just doing it"" but at this point there's no way around it, it just needs to be done. you wholeheartedly agree with them, and feel like the ultimate solution _is_ to ""just do it"". your brain however immediately reminds you how ""it's never worked before, so why will it work now?"" this isn't just a small voice, it is backed by the combined anxiety of every failure and inadequacy you have ever had. --- i'll attempt to explain what lies behind this sense of hopelessness: this sense of hopelessness, in its simplest form, is the feeling that ""it's never worked, so why would it change?"" however, it goes deeper than that. the following is the main thought process: - according to other people you just need to try hard enough to solve the problem - you feel like you have tried counn't care anymore"" ( ditto ) - ""i hate myself"" (when i metaphorically close my eyes, cover my ears, and run from what i need to do yelling ""lalalalalalalala"", also when i am sitting doing something i enjoy and remember what i'm supposed to be doing) - ""i just can't."" (when i try to calm myself or when i'm lying in a fetal position on the bed, spiraling deeper into depression) - ""i just want the world to go away"" (this feeling makes me realize why some people kill themselves. i fortunately just retreat to my bed or some form of entertainment that allows my brain to shut off temporarily) --- i'm not saying this is permanent problem, or that there aren't any solutions, just that it's incredibly difficult, more difficult than i feel most anyone can imagine. it's the torture of hopelessness, with the frustration of fully knowing with your rational brain that hope itself is all that is needed to solve the problem, yet finding that hope hopelessly far away. please, everyone. think before you tell someone to ""just try."" they may have forgotten how to. --- edit: some people may say that you just need to build in systems, and i agree that that is a good solution, but at least for me, i've tried so many of my own systems that even trying to talk with it causes my brain to lock up with anxiety. likely because it forces me to confront all my past failures, which further discourages me from trying. i'd still love to hear any advice people have though. --- tl;dr; learned helplessness isn't thinking you are helpless, it is feeling that you've forgotten how to try. if you really wanted to try it would have worked, since people say to just try, so you must not really _want_ to try, so you begin to instead want to want to try. in addition, confronting it in any way brings with it all the anxiety of every past failure, meaning that often, instead of doing something you often fail to do you just close your eyes and hope it'll go away."

adhd,anxiety,1383,"the two are actually quite similar, so i would definitely take a look to make sure that you are going down the right path. it is also called ""emotional dysregulation disorder"" and it includes impulsivity, trouble concence of a 3-year-old, and you lack object constancy. so basically, you are constantly suspicious and worried about a close person's emotions changing when they aren't constantly talking to you or directly in your area."
ptsd,bipolar,1419,"i saw your post on weighted blankets and how it can help you sleep. it normally takes me over an hour to fall asleep and normally only sleep about 4-5 hours a night. i gave it a shot and bought a weighted blanket and for the past 2 weeks i have fallen asleep faster than my husband and sleep a glorious 7-8 hours straight. so thank you who ever posted that, because hat was what i clearly needed."
ptsd,depression,1424,"8 years after everything that happened, i live a normal life, but i wonder who i would be if i wasn't abused. i had my life destroyed at the time. i wished that person would be punished for what he did."
bipolar,ptsd,1427,"i know i still deal with a lot of guilt because of my own journey of recovery: the starts and stops, random days when you’re not coping the best, feeling like i sectives, experiences, and places we start from. if you’re road is bumpy, off the beaten path, that’s ok. if anything, remember to be kind to yourself this weekend."
adhd,bipolar,1432,"i took my last one today, and luckily i can get the prescription one more time from the apothecary(?) before i need to have a doctor's appointment. (just a regular check) i have 4 exams in 2 weeks. having to wait for a doctor's appointment would have been horrible. tldr just check how much you have left, and that you are good until the next refill :d"
depression,anxiety,1435,anyone else sick of other people ? i feel like nobody gets me and for some reason i attract drama and i sometimes believe it’s due to jealousy from other people. every time i come out of my shell and be myself i always seem to attract bad people and i don’t know if it’s because i’m highly empathetic and people sense it. urgh i’m just gonna revert back to being quiet and to myself. honestly
none,depression,1437,"yesterday, after finishing my office work i left for home in my car. on the way i saw my neighbour walking on the footpath. i offered him a lift. he politely refused saying he is in a hurry."
depression,anxiety,1440,"did my title catch your attention enough? good. because i have no idea what to write here. only time i need to use a subreddit like this is when i'm really freaked out, and when i'm upset like this i can't ll the responses. i'm going to be writing an update post which will be titled something along the lines of [""my fate rests in this title: creative.. i know.. thank you and have a good day! edit 2: added link"
anxiety,adhd,1443,"i consistently talk to myself. sometimes i will sit down, and have conversations with myself. it's like a back and forth q&amp;a; as my mind wonders off about a curiosity, or unce""idiot"", ""stupid"", or ""loser"". in all honesty, i feel like i only call myself these names to motivate myself to do better next time. however, i'm not sure how helpful it really is."
anxiety,ptsd,1444,"which is, now, the longest i've gone without an incident. three years ago i was having them weekly, i couldn't even get on public transport or go into shops. i feel like i've made massive steps and i'm really, really proud of myself. here's to another six!"
bipolar,anxiety,1445,"you are climbing a mountain, it's hell, you want to give up , you push on and when you finally think you can't take another step, someone passes you on the way back down and tells you it's just 5 more minutes. a grueling ten minutes pass, you collapse on a rock and drop your pack. you see the summit. you lie on the ground for ten more minutes trying to shake out the last drops of water from the bottle into your mouth and they dribble down your face instead. you brought double the water everyone else did and it wasn't enoughiew was beautiful, you should see the view from the peak, it's amazing, so worth the trip, and you go wtf. you know night will come eventually, climbing up that mountain, never reaching the ""summit"", uncertain of how many hours you have left. only that night will come and then the struggle will end. stop making false promises that ""it will get better"". stop asking me to believe in fairytales. i don't want another false hope only to be shattered again like a glass falling to hard floor. i am so tired of picking up the pieces."
depression,anxiety,1447,"i don't know if it's because i feel they won't care, like i'm being annoying, or if i realize i simply don't want to share. i just know i do it."
anxiety,depression,1451,i just need to get over it!! i can get a job! i can apply! i can interview and do the job!! why is it so hard to make myself do the applications holy shit!!!
bipolar,depression,1454,"well lady... i run off to different countries, i steal cars, i get drunk, i take drugs, i have sex with strangers, i cut myself, i punch myself in the face, i try to kill myself, i have major anxiety and i’m baseline depressed 3 times a year. does that answer your question?"
none,adhd,1456,"maybe this way of saying it is fine, but when people ask around and compare test scores, i genuinely believe and want to tell people that they shouldn't focus on what other people scored but focus on themselves and their own work. i don't want to sound too formal or even rude since i am a student. so how should i reply to people asking whatever test mark i received?"
ptsd,bipolar,1458,"so long story short, recently i’ve been noticing i have more stomach troubles. vomiting, diarrhea, etc. yesterday i had another “stomach bug” but i noticed as soona man had gotten too close to me and i almost threw up in my car on the way home. does anyone else experience this? is this something i should tell my psychiatrist?"
depression,adhd,1460,"does anyone else ever feel like... they aren’t doing things for enjoyment but they’re just doing manual controls of themselves bc they have to? “ okay now it’s time to eat. okay that’s done, now it’s time to lay down. okay that’s done, now it’s time to see your friends” but everything really just feels like you’re going through the motions without any real enjoyment?"
bipolar,ptsd,1463,"travel back in time to when you first received your diagnosis. what would you tell your former self about the disease, coping mechanisms, relationships (romantic and not), therapy, etc. what do you wish you had known? what do you wish someone had told you?"

none,anxiety,1468,"it's not that we lose power all the time, internet is slow, poverty, hassling, haggling, scams, the things that most people hate... it's that it has made me so goddamn cynical. i have to assume that anyone who's indian that approaches us, wants to take something from us. i talk to a man for 5 minutes and he invites us to dinner. he probably wantsy speak a word. i'm to the point where i'm about to just completely ignore any passerby who attempts to speak with us. is that too much? any advice on coping with this kind of cynicism? i can't afford not to be vigilant like this, because i feel like i'd be sacrificing safety. but i also hate not being able to give people the benefit of the doubt."
ptsd,bipolar,1469,"this week, i learned how my ex-wife treated my therapy. she would accuse me of ""getting worse"", so she would takes my kids to her parents for a few days and tell me she was staying with them. she made me believe i was getting worse, but i trusted her, since she was the one who helped me in the first place. i found out from her parents that she never stayed mfortable in my progress. my children are thankful that i'm no longer putting up with her lies, because they're old enough to see her manipulation. my 7 and 10 year old hugged me last night and told me that i'm a great dad. mom's out on a drinking binge right now, and i couldn't be happier, because now she can't use my kids or my recovery against me anymore."
anxiety,adhd,1471,"it started off okay, i was answering questions, trying to get to know the 2 interviewers. then the ceo of the company asked a question, i began to answer, and he kept interrupting me when i began to talk. this totally derailed my train of thought, stressed me out to the max, and i started to cry. i did regain composure and finish the interview but i just want to crawl into a hole and die. the thought of going to another interview, even at another company, and i start crying all over again. help."
none,adhd,1482,"i have some knowledge in financial math and some python, c, and sql skills. finding a job has been pretty rough so far, and i would really prefer to get into the workforce instead of going to more school. what kinda jobs are out there that look specifically for a math degree?"
