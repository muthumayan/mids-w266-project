anxiety,ptsd,145,"wife had panic attack in the theater and passed out. my wife passed out from a panic attack yesterday in the theatre while we were watching *a quiet place*. i was so scared and didn't know what to do. about an hour into the movie, there's a scene where someone steps on a nail. it wasn't even very gory, but i guess it triggered some bad memories for her. a few seconds after that scene, my wife's arm started twitching kind of like a seizure. at the same time, she started making sounds like she was snoring or maybe choking. when i looked at her, her head was lolled to the side and her eyes were closed. not realizing what was happening, i nudged her a bit, thinking she had fallen asleep. when her head rolled to the other side and there wasn't any other response my concern sky-rocketed. i took her head in my hands and gently shook her a little bit trying to wake her up. her eyes partially opened, and i could see her pupils were looking up like when you roll your eyes. there was no other response. i tilted her head forward and the ""snoring"" sound stopped, but she was still unconscious. at this point,d her and help her feel safe. i tried to just hold her and comfort her. after about a half hour she was doing better. i felt so helpless when she was unconscious. it's very scary when you suddenly realize your loved one is having a medical emergency. later in the evening, she revealed to me that when she was a teenager, she had an abusive boyfriend that would rape her, cut her with a scalpel, and poke her with needles. sick stuff like that i guess. she wouldn't say much more about it than that. i am angry. not at her, but at the thought some sicko did this to her. and i hurt. i grieve that she has experienced something so traumatic it causes this type of thing. she agreed we will get her into some therapy. she needs healing that i never knew she needed. i also know this isn't about me, but i feel a bit hurt this is just now coming out. we've been married about 5 years, and i never knew this stuff. what else don't i know? i don't know what type of advice i'm looking for. how can i be there for her? how can i help? what do i do if this happens again? did i do the right thing both during and after?"

bipolar,depression,150,"social media? facebook seriously stresses me out. does anyone else struggle with social media? i have a hard time staying connected to friends and family because the things people post can be serious triggers for me. it doesn't matter if i'm upcycling or downcycling, something is bound to either agitate or depress me. sometimes i go on binges of unfollowing people. that doesn't help because then i don't have those connections and my feed fills up with promotede relationships. i have my immediate family, and a couple of close friends (that's funny. i haven't seen them in literally a year and a half) but everyone else is an acquaintance at best. i don't even talk to my mother unless i have to, and that's after we've mended our relationship (as much as possible at this point). i'm not asking for advice, i just want to know that i'm not alone in feeling like this. do others have the same experiences? can you share some?"
depression,bipolar,155,"why is everything so fucking hard now that i've struggles with this bullshit for 7 years, i've come to the realisation that literally no one cares no one is genuinely there for you. everyone will claim to be there for you and beg you to open up to them because they want todays on end because you just can't quite bring yourself to talk to people. going through days of mania followed by weeks of lowness and having people expect you to be okay because of those few days of mania everyone wants to be there for you until you actually show symptoms"

bipolar,anxiety,160,"thanks dad, it's always nice to be reminded i'm a failure. [rant] [long] i gotta vent. dad, you've been giving mixed compliments for the past week. backhanded praise and shit. ""i don't care if you fail, i care if you try."" too fucking bad dad, i care more if i fail than if i try, and i get that that doesn't get me anywhere; it feels pretty shitty to be reminded my ridiculous rejection sensitivity makes me a terrible person. fine, impedes my success. you didn't call me a terrible person. but that's what i'm getting at. the rejection sensitivity. what amounted to ""your not trying for the sake of avoiding getting hurt disappoints and irritates me"" turned into ""you're a terrible person."" or maybe i took it to mean ""you're broken."" i often think i am. how do you think it feels when i submit 10 job applications and my brain does the same thing about not hearing back? how do you think it feels to be constantly looking at jobs trying to balance what i'm qualified for, what won't be soul-crushingly mind-numbing, and what will actually move me forward in life? and then after beating myself up to get myself to start and continue that process, getting discouraged either not hearing back or hearing i didn't get the job. and then there of performing work and am now telling myself ""you're gonna be the lazy drug using social security beneficiary nobody wants to get their money"" while i tell myself i don't deserve it because i feel like a liar. but you know what? it may hurt, **but i take it on for you**. because i acknowledge my debilitating fear of trying on the job front and would rather take on shame than let my failure to launch weigh you down. when i was growing up, i used to tell myself ""no one can hurt you more than your own family."" i think that's still true for me today. thanks dad. *do you know why i changed therapists after you got your cancer diagnosis?* **i wanted to make sure you'd be proud of me before you died.** i sure as hell don't feel like you are right now. tl;dr: my dad hurt me and pissed me off by telling me he doesn't feel like i try and expressing frustration at how much time i put into videogames (where i can at least feel successful at **something**) when i spent less time on videogames today than half of what i spend most days in general. seriously, videogaming and weight loss are the only two things i've succeeded at since graduation. maybe not dying, too, but i don't think that should count. good to know i'm a disappointment."

bipolar,depression,286,"yesterday my ex started harassing me and then a friend choked me yesterday was rough. i broke things off with my ex the day before yesterday due to some toxic and manipulative behavior. he freaked out on me and has been sending me messages on every app possible saying some of the most horrible things imaginable up until yesterday evening when i blocked him on everything possible. we we're dating for 6 years and i feel so fucking dumb. it was obvious helogized and then when i said i didn't want to hang again he tried to blame me for his actions so i blocked him too. i think i'm ok emotionally, but what the fuck? idk why i keep attracting people like this. i just don't understand and i'm so sick of it. i'm a sweet person and i don't feel like i deserve it. anyway, i just wanted to vent about my fucking horrible day yesterday. it was a scary day. as always, you guys are wonderful people and thank you :)"
bipolar,depression,290,"do you notice patterns? i'm definitely in a depressed episode right now. it is easy to tell because i cry for no reason, think about hurting myself, and plan my death. i think i'm starting to notice patterns. i tend to buy and eat a lot of sweets during these times. have you noticed patterns?"

bipolar,ptsd,299,do you guys get nightmares? i had the worst one of my life tonight. i was psychotic and had a flashback to my attempt. multiple times. my hand was talking to me and telling me bad things. i have 3-4 nightmares a week and they aren't getting better. i don't know why this is happening.
anxiety,depression,301,"i'm 25 and i'm tired. tired of knowing who i am, but not what i want to be. tired of society deciding where i should be at in life and what i should be doing. tired of feeling like all i've done is waste my time not knowing what to do. tired of being told to make a difference in the world. tireat. tired of looking at others achievements and feeling perpetually inferior. tired of feeling like i'm in some race that i'm losing. tired of self doubt. tired of this never-ending cycle. i'm exhausted and i don't know what to do about it. does anyone else feel this way? if so, what did you do?"

bipolar,anxiety,326,"do you have garbled speech? i do at times. sometimes i will say ""the splu biders"" or ""tub bath"". reading is fine and easy, not dyslexic at all but the speech is weird. today i forget to take my meds, and found it to be worse than normal (with meds). anyone else experience this?"
adhd,depression,327,"i got a 3.48 gpa over my last five college classes!!! it's the highest my gpa has been in my entire life. i can hardly begin to describe the combination of triumph and excitement and hope for what's to come, along with with the melancholy of what could've been, and the dread for how it might all go wrong. you guys know the feeling i'm talking about right?"
bipolar,anxiety,328,doing so much better the school year is finally starting! i've been going in on extra days to decorate my classroom. it's pretty much decorated and now i'm organizing my cabinets since they're a mess with random stuff shoved places. i think by the start of the year i'll have stuff totally organized. i'm so so so excited! it gives me a sense of worse. i'm sure the kids will stress me out when they come and i'll get all anxious but for now i'm having a great time.

depression,ptsd,358,"i feel guilty and i want bad things to happen to me just so i can justify my depression i live a very mediocre, sometimes even luxurious life. i‚Äôve never been through any trauma or abuse or loss. anrible things happen to me or i exaggerate the somewhat bad experiences i‚Äôve been through just so i can validate my depression. is there a name for this phenomenon? and does anyone else experience it?"
depression,anxiety,361,"i don't even have the energy to fight back anymore. i always feel so consumed by self hatred and the fact that i can be such a piece of shit. i am scared i might actually do it some day. that i might acfor merely existing. i'm scared and i cant handle the stress anymore and i want something bad to happen. that's all that's ever on my mind anymore, is i wish something would come and hurt me in some way."

bipolar,anxiety,369,"""1) nothing makes you happy/all you do is complain/2) everytime we talk, there's conflict, so i'm anxious whenever we speak/ 3) every time you talk, you complain."" i'm afraid of being this unhappy person who pushes people away. anyone hear else? 3 long stories; tldr at the bottom. so in the title, within quotation marks, are what i've heard from people i spent the most time with. 1) my mom, 2) a now-ex boyfriend, and 3) a former friend. 1) my mom kinda blew up in the parking lot of a hospital. the doctor said i didn't need a cough pill for my infection, and would be fine with only the prescription she gave me, and then my mom asked if she could prescribe me with a cough syrup. the doctor agreed to prescribe a strong cough syrup, and i asked if i don't need a cough pill, ""do i need cough syrup?"" the doctor said no, but said ""the medicines won't react with one another,"" and ""if you want a cough syrup, i can prescribe one."" *but i don't.* my cough won't go away (respitory infection) until the steroids kick in, but it will go away. i don't like taking meds i don't need. i'm defensive about this, because every time i have respitory issues, my mom asks the doc for a cough syrup ""for my own good"" and i feel like shit bc it's got some depressive drug in it, and i feel ultra sluggish the morning after i take it. i don't need it so i'm adverse to taking it. my mom says it's ridiculous that i have a cough and won't take a cough syrup, when no cough syrup was prescribed or suggested. the steroids will take it's course. but mothers will be mothers. i just hate taking drugs i don't actually need. (and i'm 18 so i'd think the doctor would have asked me first. guess not.) anyway she called me ungrateful and wouldn't let me speak and i dunno. it hit me. she said: ""i'm better off dead than i am alive to you, because nothing i do as your mother makes you happy."" i wanted to shoot myself in the mouth right there and then, ngl. i know that isn't the (logical) answer to this, but she isn't the only one who's said stuff like this. 2) my ldr boyfriend of two years broke up with me last night. he says he doesn't feel like he can talk to me, because he says offhanded things, and for a while, i didn't address them until months later (which is toxic). and now he feels that he'll fuck up no matter what he does, so what's the point. in the past i've addressed things as they came up and he either made fun of me, got super defensive, or asked ""so what's the problem?"". for example: he didn't speak to me for long periods of time. for like. a year. cancelled majority of skype dates at the last second. i said that i knew he has other obligations, but that still felt a bit emotionally neglected. (being left on read for days and sometimes weeks, not hearing from him for months, reading an ""i love you, too"" from him was rare. i felt like he didn't like me.) but he said that i had no reason to believe that. he had a roommate who made me cry, and he didn't defend me. even if i say that i didn't appreciate a comment, he would just join him. of course, he didn't mean to be rude, and of course he didn't mean to overlook my crying, didn't mean to misunderstand me. but he refused to buy earbuds because of his ""indispoable income"" (even if he went out to drink once a month). which gave his roommate ammo to be a bully. so i mailed my then-bf earbuds and he lost them. it felt as if he didn't put any effort into the relationship, and was justifying himself. when i asked if he wanted to break up, he sounded surprised and confused as to why. said that he loves me. i wasn't angry, just hurt and confused with all the mixed messages. but i said i believed him and ignored my gut. plus, on holidays, he drives six hundred miles in one go to visit me (and his family. so contrary to what he says, i'm not the only reason he comes to the city i live in.) but he said ""you think i wanna see my family? barely anyone there wants to see me. i'md avoiding me, too. avoiding everyone. got in a real bad funk. said uncalled for comments to me and to other people. i understand how depression can be; but that doesn't excuse her from being mean. from playing rough and with scissors (as a seventeen year old). from going out of her way to patronize people. but she put on her snapchat story her suicidal thoughts, talking about how everyone she knows is against her. so i swiped up, let her know that i apologize if i wronged her, and that i want her to be okay. that i don't think anyone is against her. that i am here if she needs to talk. she said that i can't make her pity me, and i was baffled. that she doesn't have the energy for my bullshit. (yikes.) that i shouldn't play nice if i don't feel nicely about a person. (still don't know what's she was talking about but it was childish. but still yikes.) and then she said all i do is complain about my family problems and boyfriend and do nothing to fix it. (that was when i said ""good to know,"" and blocked her. hehe.) it's so funny that she *asked me* what's wrong, didn't accept ""nothing"" for an answer, and then secretly hated when i was open and honest. i thought she was my friend. but i guess only therapists are meant to hear your problems. anyway. i digress. days after i blocked her, she came around me in person. went out of her way to sit next to me. acted fearful, as if i would reject her. took every single chance she got to be overly nice. for example: i was presenting and the class (of 13 people) was talking over me. she stood up, cupped both hands over her mouth, and projected: ""everyone! chris is talking! it is important to hear what they say, so that they can finish their presentation!"" sat down, then grinned at me. the class had the same weirded-out expression as i did. like. ugh. that was so artificial that it hurt me. i have a floridan friend who i tell some of these situations with, and he says it sounds like the other person has some unsolved problems of their own. my therapist said the same thing about all three scenarios. that nothing i complain about is like. ""i'm so sad my dad got me a blue car. i wanted a red one."" y'know? like the problems that bother me are literally ""so i'm homeless and don't know where i'm sleeping tonight "" or ""i got 27 spider bites in my sleep"" or ""my mom is threatening to kick me out and i'm an unemployed student"" or something that can't be given advice, because it's totally out of anyone's control. like when my car got totalled and i kept having flashbacks about the crash throughout the day. i couldn't sleep at night. for weeks. or when three of my classmates died. or when i was in a sexually abusive relationship for six months, got assaulted everyday on school grounds, and didn't tell anyone for eight months. i have flashbacks and awful dreams about *that* one to this day. but i don't say anything until someone asks me what's wrong. and even if they do, i'm reluctant to say so. bc none of this can be hugged better. it's heavy. it's uncomfortable and nobody wants to hear it. those are the only things that get to me. those are the things i go to therapy for. but my therapist doesn't believe in dwelling on (talking about) past traumas and griefs. i don't know what anyone wants me to do anymore. do i just let go of *everything*? i do not exagerrate; these things happened in the same twelve months. i'm not trying to excuse my complaints, but, yikes. i don't know what to make of any of this. anyway. tldr: nobody i open up to stick around. are all of these situations like. situations where both parties have made acceptable mistakes in handling their situation? or am i this unhappy person who makes people miserable because i complain so much? am i ungrateful? am i being crazy for saying the things i do? does anyone else hear statements like these from people who see you the most? it's times like these that makes self destructive behavior so easy."

adhd,anxiety,1322,"what learned helplessness is like just in case anyone isn't aware of what learned helplessness feels like, and as a warning to people not to keep trying the same thing over and over, i've written the following. i will use the term ""brain"" to refer to the unconscious, impulsive parts of the brain, the parts that aren't ""you"", and ""you"" to refer to your conscious experience and rational brain. (disclaimer, this is only my experience, i don't know what other people's experiences are.) --- imagine walking around, going through life, except you don't decide what you do. your brain decides everything for you and you have no say. it wants to play video games, so you play video games. that isn't to say you don't fight it, but on those occasions that you do you either are simply unable to do anything, or every frustration with yourself for every past failure floods upon you, washing your willpower away in a tidal wave of anxiety. you quickly learn the only way to fight is to not fight at all. --- now, imagine somebody calmly tells you, ""i know it's hard, but you really need to just get up and do it. i have no magic bullet unfortunately."" this is nice, they know that you have a hard time ""just doing it"" but at this point there's no way around it, it just needs to be done. you wholeheartedly agree with them, and feel like the ultimate solution _is_ to ""just do it"". your brain however immediately reminds you how ""it's never worked before, so why will it work now?"" this isn't just a small voice, it is backed by the combined anxiety of every failure and inadequacy you have ever had. --- i'll attempt to explain what lies behind this sense of hopelessness: this sense of hopelessness, in its simplest form, is the feeling that ""it's never worked, so why would it change?"" however, it goes deeper than that. the following is the main thought process: - according to other people you just need to try hard enough to solve the problem - you feel ""i just don't care anymore"" ( ditto ) - ""i hate myself"" (when i metaphorically close my eyes, cover my ears, and run from what i need to do yelling ""lalalalalalalala"", also when i am sitting doing something i enjoy and remember what i'm supposed to be doing) - ""i just can't."" (when i try to calm myself or when i'm lying in a fetal position on the bed, spiraling deeper into depression) - ""i just want the world to go away"" (this feeling makes me realize why some people kill themselves. i fortunately just retreat to my bed or some form of entertainment that allows my brain to shut off temporarily) --- i'm not saying this is permanent problem, or that there aren't any solutions, just that it's incredibly difficult, more difficult than i feel most anyone can imagine. it's the torture of hopelessness, with the frustration of fully knowing with your rational brain that hope itself is all that is needed to solve the problem, yet finding that hope hopelessly far away. please, everyone. think before you tell someone to ""just try."" they may have forgotten how to. --- edit: some people may say that you just need to build in systems, and i agree that that is a good solution, but at least for me, i've tried so many of my own systems that even trying to talk with it causes my brain to lock up with anxiety. likely because it forces me to confront all my past failures, which further discourages me from trying. i'd still love to hear any advice people have though. --- tl;dr; learned helplessness isn't thinking you are helpless, it is feeling that you've forgotten how to try. if you really wanted to try it would have worked, since people say to just try, so you must not really _want_ to try, so you begin to instead want to want to try. in addition, confronting it in any way brings with it all the anxiety of every past failure, meaning that often, instead of doing something you often fail to do you just close your eyes and hope it'll go away."

(this will be kinda rambly) i was diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety disorder after i checked into a psychiatric hospital a few years back, but i always felt as i grew up that something was wrong. when i went to go meet my biological mother (who is very bipolar) when i was 18 things started to click with me that i needed to figure out a way to find meaning. it didn't help that my step-mom was an abusive cunt. so overall i kinda suck at being a person.(still do) anyways, i've struggled with constantly feeling down, and also feeling a whole lotta shit i didn't really understand. because of this i turned to weed and alcohol when i was 15. went through a few phases of drinking hard, but really weed was my poison of choice(still dont think it's bad but that's for another sub). again anyways because of the plant i kinda regained a sense of what it meant to be a healthy funcnt know how we'll pay the rent, things get complicated with family, with work, with life. and all of it together makes me wanna opt out. but then i think of leaving him by himself to deal with it himself and what a living hell that would be. even if i cant do much, ill do what i can till i can't. because if i dont that would make me sadder than anything i can ever encounter in my life. my point is that out there there are strong, amazing, incredibly intelligent and driven people, who do this shit alone. while feeling everything. and its heart breaking. my dad spent his life trying to make me feel welcome when every fiber of my being says i don't belong on this earth. the least i can do is gtfo bed and try to do something. even if my battle that day is just to brush my teeth. so that he can see a good looking smile that he made. to make him feel just a little better. that's my part, my mission. thats what gets me up. there are people that can use your help, and you owe it to them. but that s just my opinion."

adhd,anxiety,1431,"i missed the exit on the interstate for work this morning and i didn't realize it until i had crossed the state line. i was already running late (of course) and i don't know what happened to me. i've done this before (missed exits, turns) but i usua why am i like this? why can't i just have a brain like a normal person? i'm sorry, i don't normally let this stuff get to me but for some reason i'm really taking this hard. anyway, thanks for letting me get that off my chest. you guys are the best."
anxiety,bipolar,1434,"got a dental cleaning for the first time in years, just wanted to share i feel so proud of myself. after having severe dental phobia and avoiding cleanings for years, a little tooth chipt i said yes. it wasn't bad at all, and this dentist is honestly one of the nicest people i've met in my life. i'm literally looking forward to my followup. i feel pretty proud of myself."
adhd,depression,1435,"strategy for beating back binge eating: dont keep bingeable foods in the house. dont buy chips, easy peel cheese wheels, crackers, ice cream, popcorn, anything you personally find bingeable. i used to be obese, never thought id get in control of my weight. long impulsive binges were my nightly vice. now, years later ive lost it all and am a normal healthy weight. turns out if i dont have quick access to convenience junk foods, i won't binge."
bipolar,anxiety,1438,keep getting impulsive rapid thoughts when i'm alone. (nsfw) i've been struggling to rationalize myself right now. i have thoughts to hurt or kill myself. or walk for hundreds of milpass. i don't want to fail.fail.fail.fail.fail. i don't know how to control this my speech is being affected by this either too fast or slow and slurred. this anxiety has to stop now.
anxiety,depression,1445,"i say ""i'm sorry"" too much for the most minimal of things, like standing in someone's way for just a moment. does anyone else notice this character trait? it's not out of habit, it's a subconscious quirk. i think, deep down, i legitimately believe i'm inconveniencing people when i say it."
depression,ptsd,1446,"i got a tattoo over my self-harm scars today. i feel pretty good right now, guys. just a little bit of info, i've been self harming since i was 10. for 7 years i've never worn short sleeves outside because i was afraid that someone would find out or judge me because of it. today, i'm finally ending this cycle of self harm.o represent oscar wilde. all represents individuality, finality, and pride in being ""different"". these works and people kept me alive through the years. thanks for listening. i don't post often, only when i feel really, really bad. this time i'm glad to be posting something good. :) edit: here's a proper look at the tattoo:"
anxiety,depression,1451,"i dislike it when someone asks me to take off my sunglasses for their convenience (in informal settings when there is sun obviously.) it has happened a few times when i was out with friends on sunny days, sitting in the shade outside of a restaurant or cafe.come awkward and cannot keep a conversation going smoothly. wearing sunglasses prevents this somehow. also in turn: i find it very rude of people to just demand someone to take off their sunglasses for your convenience. feels belittleling somehow. thoughts???"
depression,ptsd,1454,"my marriage evaporated in an instant i came home from work and my husband had moved out. we had been together for more than 15 years. no desire to discuss what went wrong, no chance of reconciliation, no warning... he was just gone. i‚Äôve had mdd for 9 years following a traumatic brain injury. now i‚Äôm in the deepest depression i can imagine. i‚Äôve been hospitalized. i‚Äôve been thru 7 weeks of outpatient. i can barely also wonder how long until everything physically starts falling apart around me because i‚Äôm not functioning and i‚Äôm alone in this house. i try to keep it clean. i care for my pets. i try to talk to someone every day so i‚Äôm not completely isolated. i‚Äôm working part time again and slugging thru it. it‚Äôs torture. i just needed to share this with someone other than my journal. the struggle to just survive is so painful."
ptsd,anxiety,1460,you know what i hate??? i'm a firefighter. i hate when people ask me about the worst things i've seen. it's like they want me to re-live the most terrifying or heartbreaking moments of my life over and over again for their amusement. i already do that often enough. &amp;#x200b; anyone have a productive way to respond?
bipolar,adhd,1462,"how much should my pdoc be doing? my current pdoc and my last couple of pdocs seem like they are leaving a lot of my care up to me. i'll tell them what's going on and how i've been feeling and they will rattle off a few meds, what they are supposed to do, and what the side effeeight to my concerns about side effects and when i need to add or drop a med, but it feels like i'm making calls that a doctor should and then are just writing a script. is this normal or have a just gotten a weird series of doctors? how do you all make these sorts of decisions?"
adhd,none,1465,"eureka!! diesel engines are my jam!!!!! i remember the laundromat in college being my favorite place to study and read (always thought that was weird, so i never told anyone). fast forward about two decades (when i'm finally diagnosed) and i'm in the kitchen with my precioue, the diesel engine of his rv or the school bus is heaven. being the last stop out in the country the school bus driver often had to wake me up! my god!!! searches ""laundromat white noise"", ""diesel engine sounds"" on youtube, jackpot!!!! i wish i had figured this out sooner."
bipolar,depression,1467,"it's my 31st birthday i didn't care to do anything this year. the only reason i bought a cake is because i have a six year old. the only reason i'm posting is because... those younger than me(wtf.) i am finally getting self discipline down and writing my books. i couldn't even imagine this all before. i've had the ups and downs but today, i am 31, and you'll get here one day, too."
