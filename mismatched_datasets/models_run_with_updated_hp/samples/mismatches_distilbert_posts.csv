bipolar,adhd,4,"i have no motivation to do anything. i don’t go to my one online class, i don’t get off of my couch except for when my dog needs me to, i can’t clean, i can’t do the laundry, my dishes are piling up, and i still can’t make myself get off of this couch. how do y’all push through? what are little things you do to get out of this?"
ptsd,anxiety,8,"it’s been a long time, but i’ve never been able to school myself into calm when i see something moving out of the corner of my eye. walking across a baseball field, basketball court, or anything with moving projectiles putnd over again (with tears in his eyes) how he’d never throw anything at me. ever. it just shows, after the many years of my life, i finally have a shoulder to lean on. and yours may not be far away, so please don’t give up."
anxiety,ptsd,10,my anxiety when i first wake up everyday is so strong i struggle to leave my bed. i wake up from a typically sound sleep and get thrown into a shitstorm nearly everyday. i used to have ptsd related nightmares; thanki've tried grounding techniques. i've tried different types of weed and different benzos. i'm thinking about doing a small meditation everyday to see how that makes me feel- are there good apps out there i could try?
depression,bipolar,14,"sleep is the only time i feel okay. i feel like i have vivid, colorful dreams where i actually feel happy but i wake up and it’s back to reality. but i’m in a constant struggle between staying up late so i can delay the inevitable of going back to work and sleeping longer. sometimes if i wake up in the middle of the night i just stay awake so i can “delay” going to work. i lie awake for hours, checking the clock every fifteen minutes... ugh... someone help me omg"
adhd,bipolar,15,"a 15 slide presentation and essay(5pages) about neurotoxicity, an essay about cystic fibrosis (12 pages), and an organic chemistry assignment all in two weeks! i thought i couldn't do it but i did. thanks to those who gave me plenty of tips on how to write more efficiently!"
adhd,none,24,"pretty much come in at 7:50 as usual, boot up my computer. my boss rushes in which is unusual this early, asks for all stock holders for a big tech company in excel. he needs it within the next 5 miice. turns out he's on his way to the ceo's office with my data, and he said thanks for saving me no one else is in yet. for me was a win, did everything on time and didn't just do the minimum asked."
bipolar,depression,26,"i was hospitalized over a week ago for a suicide attempt. since i've been on around 30 different meds without much results, i requested etc (electro convulsive therapy) since they did it at the hospital i was in. i got three rounds of treatment and my depression has been zapped out of my brain. i feel so much better. just had to share. :)"
anxiety,adhd,36,"i can't sit still when i get my eyebrows done, and when i'm in class i usually doodle to focus. i pay attention very well in school regardless of that, and drawing helps me focus."
bipolar,depression,49,things aren’t even that bad for me right now. last week was way worse. i’m doing okay at work keeping up with my to do list. i’m getting along with the family. for some reason i feel like i want to go to the hospital to get away from life. this is a feeling i’ve had many times. i always remind myself how much more comfortable my bed is in those moments. does anyone else have those thoughts?
anxiety,depression,50,"tomorrow i bury my best friend who tragically passed away at the age of 25. i'm heartbroken and i will be speaking at his funeral. i am happy with the speech but i am nervous, petrified to mess up. he was an incredible guy and i want to send him off well, justify what he meant to me. my ex who broke up with me 2 months ago has kept contact to ask how i have been doing and if i ever needed anything go to her. i went to the gym yesterday evening just to pass the time and maybe work off a small hangover i was nursing from the night before. i felt okay but by the end of my session i was very tired. as i was walking back towards my flat i spot my ex with a guy next to her sitting down. i could have turned around but i didn't. i go up to her and say hi, she seems shocked to see me and asks if i'm doing okay. i say no, not really and say i'll leave them to it and say goodbye. as i walk down the road my ex has caught up with me after she runs to catch up with me. she says she has done this to tell me thatuy who has a family that makes her laugh, feel alive. this guy has a child. i recognise him from her xmas party. i'm really confused about why she chased after me. it's obvious she cares but is she feeling guilty, trying to spare my feelings in the hardest time of my life. i do want her back in my life but seeing her with another guy hurt big time. seeing them close to each other eating ice cream. she works with him, did she like him when we were dating. i also hate the idea of her sharing her sympathy and support with other people, especially a guy like that. and it hurts to hear her say to me he's going through a hard time. i'm going through the hardest time of my life. i feel like i can't use her as a crutch. i'm so confused, hurt, a mess. i bury my best friend tomorrow . i am absolutely terrified. i feel sick, like i'm going to mess up and ruin everything. the last 2 months has been the worst of my life, it just has. i want things to be better. i want him back. i want her back. i feel terrible."
depression,anxiety,55,"when you have depression or anxiety aging feels 10 times worse. i’m 21 and i feel incredibly old already. i suppose the worst part is that when you are a kid in highschool people always say that life “gets better” and of course the media really hypes up your early 20s as the best time in yow , life doesn’t end when you turn 30. but for someone like me who probably never will get married or have kids aging seems hopeless. my body will decompose all while i get forgotten about by the world. hell, being lonely at 21 sucks enough i can’t imagine being lonely and isolated at 40+ ."
anxiety,adhd,58,"to save you a google search, depersonalization is when a person feels like they are detached from themselves and they are seeing life almost as if they are in a dream. basically, they are very spaced out all the time. i work retail at the moment and while i'm working, i'm almost always either really nervous/anxious or in this dream-like state of mind. i'm so sick of it, man. edit: i don't know why but when i made my title i must've capitalized is and probably on accident. ignore that please, lol."
bipolar,anxiety,62,"just wanted to share that i finally got myself together enough to book an appointment with the therapist. i kinda stopped going and kept putting it off (it's ok i'll go next month, etc.) three years later i find myself on the edge, i'm relieved to have made the call. wish me luck!"
depression,adhd,65,"anyone else? i have difficulty sometimes even answering a comment on my own threads (when i make them), and **this** thread took me 3 times to write, as did the last comment i made. :|"
ptsd,anxiety,69,so for a bit of background. around 8 months ago or so my best friend claimed someone r*ped her. i got myself involved and messaged the guy. a couple of nights later he comes to my door at 11pm and can't get a doctors appointment just yet because my parents either can't be asked to go to the doctors or there to busy. i just want some supportive words or any advice on how to not think about it.
bipolar,adhd,70,"i feel like every time i have a conversation or try to, i’ll have em in the first half, but by the second i imagine the -2 social points from sims. it’s not just imaginary. after i get that feeling, i notice the people from those situations liking me less. i’ at me and my gut is telling me to stop and continuing on until i’ve ruined the atmosphere. telling a joke that is insensitive/being annoying/rambling/etc it feels awful because it does numbers on my reputation. it gets in the way of dating and making friends."
adhd,depression,78,"yeah, i’ll try harder. and i’ll also try extra hard to leave on time today instead of sticking around past the point where they’re actually paying me to be here."
anxiety,bipolar,80,"this should be a celebratory post but i've spent two days awake, shaking, throwing up or otherwise... i don't know if i can do it but i can't live the hell of staying in our 1 bedroom apartment any longer. i got hired at an oil and vinegar bar, and i really want to work there because i cook a lot and  shopped there i dreaded when the employees bombed me with information. so yeah, i work at 2 tomorrow expecting to not last the 2 week probation period. everything i'm studying just gets lost in my head and i retreat back to my no window bedroom calm down. but i can't lose my car or stay in this house."
depression,adhd,87,"sorry if this has been asked before, but i was wondering if anyone knows or has experienced their intelligence deteriorating because of depression (or maybe meds)? er every year, i can't tell if it's because of my illness (i have chronic depression so i'll be taking meds my whole life) or what. any insight would be appreciated."
anxiety,depression,89,"i came into this year in a good place after years of wading through shit. i was kicking ass at my job, i have sorted a long term medical problem, i achieved dreams this winter by freeride snowboarding a mountain. i came out as bi / genderfluid to my family and it went well. but this year since then has fucked me up. i haven't touched another human in three months. i've been single for 12 years. i happening again every day recently. i don't want to see any more fucking therapists any more i hate the idea of it. i can't go through reopening all that painful old stuff again i don't want to deal with this bullshit any more. i don't want to burden my family with this, i've put them through enough. fucking 2020. its a good job i don't have a gun because its sure looking like a way to escape recently."
ptsd,adhd,94,"someone knocks in the middle of the day and, after grabbing your phone in case you need to dial 911, you remain absolutely still and quiet so they won’t know you’re here. it is, of course, the mailman. any other additions?"
adhd,anxiety,95,"i always forget to respond to friend's text messages and even my girlfriend's. after i read them too! i have definitely upset some people, and i feel like i'm not giving my girlfriend the right amount of attention. it's like i get distracted thinking about what i'm going to reply with!"
bipolar,ptsd,98,"i know i still deal with a lot of guilt because of my own journey of recovery: the starts and stops, random days when you’re not coping the best, feeling like i sectives, experiences, and places we start from. if you’re road is bumpy, off the beaten path, that’s ok. if anything, remember to be kind to yourself this weekend."
depression,adhd,99,"does anyone else ever feel like... they aren’t doing things for enjoyment but they’re just doing manual controls of themselves bc they have to? “ okay now it’s time to eat. okay that’s done, now it’s time to lay down. okay that’s done, now it’s time to see your friends” but everything really just feels like you’re going through the motions without any real enjoyment?"
depression,bipolar,100,"i didn't wake up yesterday until 6pm. i laid in bed until 9, woke up and bought a case of beer and 2 packs of cigarettes and started binge drinking. i took a shower for the first time in days. i wanted to be clean and drunk for what i planned to do. today is my 25th birthday. i didn't want to live this day. i planned to cut my arms up and bleed to death in the shower, but i wanted to play a few last rounds of rocket league to calm my nerves. then i got a message from a random player i was in a few matches with: ""wanna play in a party? playing with randoms is getting onmy spirits throughout the day today. i've told my family everything and will be seeking help in the form of therapy and a possible medication adjustment, if necessary. if you're out there reading this and you can't see the way back up, cling to me and we'll climb up together. again, thank you all so much for taking the time out of your day to wish me well and feel free to pm me anytime or to add me on psn: coonroast55 (it has to do with my last name and the fact that me and my friends used to put -roast on the end of everyone's last name for no reason whatsoever). &lt;3"
adhd,depression,104,thank you to this [wonderful who went waaaay out of their way to try and hurt my feelings but ended up turning a bad day into a good one because it reminded me that some people have it worse. there are people out there who only feel good when they make others feel bad and those are the people to feel truly sorry for. i'm so flattered that they saw me as a target :)
depression,bipolar,106,"i'm on the long long road to recovery and the past few months have been comparitively really stable and happy for me. i don't cry nearly as often, i'm much more productive, and much more hopeful. but the ng at me a lot yesterday and i was so close to just ending it right there, even though i know i don't really want to, and i know i'm gonna be in a better place in just over a month (going back to college)."
anxiety,adhd,109,"so i am graduating from college in december. i really need a new macbook and while looking for jobs in my field i found a ups seasonal helper. even though i saw that it's pretty easy to get in (have a pulse, can life 70 lbs, can follow instructions) i was still anxious about the interview. turns out there really wasn't evenrview"" part. she made me write my social down and asked if i had any questions. i just told her my school schedule for the rest of the semester and she said that would be no issue at all and boom done. didn't hurt that she went to the same school and subject as me! she said she will call in a couple days. i am super excited!"
none,adhd,111,"scientists are part of our culture, we aren't some separate class of people that have special immunity of irrational behavior. one of the cultural issues that the practice of science is not immune from is implicit bias, a subconscious aspect of racism. this isn't something we think about, it is in the fabric of how we conduct ourselves and what we expect of others, and it can have an enormous effect on opportunities for individuals. tomorrow, we will have a panel of people who have studied the issues and who have personally dealt with them in their lives as scientists.  them, how to recognize them in yourself and others. please ask questions (in a civil manner of course!) we want you to learn. as for those who would reject a difficult conversation (rejecting others is always easier than looking at your own behavior), i would caution that we will not tolerate racist, rude or otherwise unacceptable behavior. one can disagree without being disagreeable. lastly, thank you to all of our readers, commenters and verified users who make /r/science a quality subreddit that continues to offer unique insights into the institution we call science."
none,adhd,119,"hello everyone. to start, this is not homework. i’m a finance graduate preparing for numerical reasoning aptitude tests. for the most part the questions in practice tests are very easy but i keep coming across one type of question that seems at first like a simple inverse proporties y hours to complete (where y is given). solve for the time it would take b to complete the whole job alone. now the problem is i can’t see any way to infer anything about bs relative, let’s say, “work ethic”. is this a flawed question as it seems to me or am i missing something?"
anxiety,depression,121,"hello, i'm about to ask my crush out in a few minutes via text message (lame, i know, but i can't find the right words in person and i don't want her to feel uncomfortablee i will probably regret it in a few years otherwise. wish me luck edit: just sent the message edit 2: she dumped me, great and friendly sub though thank you all very much."
none,adhd,126,"especially for google play's music, most of it aggregates from youtube it seems. i find myself listening to live performances really often, which inherently isn't bad....i'm just not a fan of 30% of the song being audience cheers or people screaming over the musician's chorus. i know i could create my own playlists by hand, but sometimes i like to discover new artists. sorry for ranting. i wanted to get this off my chest while i go back to work."
anxiety,depression,131,"i consistently talk to myself. sometimes i will sit down, and have conversations with myself. it's like a back and forth q&amp;a; as my mind wonders off about a curiosity, or unce""idiot"", ""stupid"", or ""loser"". in all honesty, i feel like i only call myself these names to motivate myself to do better next time. however, i'm not sure how helpful it really is."
ptsd,anxiety,144,"this week has been god awful, but finding this sub and being able to relate / not feel so alone is really helpful and i’m really happy that this community exists."
depression,ptsd,148,"my 17 year old son committed suicide six months ago. it was frustrating for me to read the top thread here today. people did care. his friends cared. his dad, me and his two brothers cared. we supported him. we got him help. we listened. we hugged him a lot. i spent hours and hours in conversation with him. it wasn't a burden. he had a unique perspective and was wise beyond his years. he was never seen as a burden. we didn't patronize him. we didn't tell him stupid nonsense. we did our best to understand. when he was having a bad stly because we miss him so much but also our resulting trauma. even so, i hold no anger towards him. i still cry every day. so much of who i was, was tied to being his mom. i'm at sea as to what meaning and purpose i now have... anyway, i wrote this to mark the anniversary of the last time i looked into his beautiful blue eyes only to see the spark that made him a compassionate, intelligent, loving soul was gone. also, to dispel the idea that all suicides happen to people who were not loved and/or supported. thank you for reading."
bipolar,depression,150,"it doesn't seem to be related to depression. i don't feel depressed, i just feel really in need of sleep. the only problem here is that i'm soon to be employed again and i know i won't be able to just do this whenever i want. but it feels like ... a necessity, like going to the bathroom or something. my body just takes over and i need that sleep. does this happen to anyone else? how do you navigate it?"
anxiety,ptsd,151,"i feel like i've cried a dozen times since hearing about it, watching parents speak on the news and reading tweets from the kids who went to school there (including some who were horribly killed). for some reasoke everyone else i strongly believe children should be protected and put first no matter what so things like this are just... so unspeakable. i hope the gun laws in america change for the sake of school children."
ptsd,bipolar,153,"at 7:23pm my dad passed away five years ago today. i have been on edge all day. sneaking off to the walking fridge to cry when i don’t have too many tickets in the window. sunday’s are always hard because of brunch. staff and gu the blood/brain barrier. but his lab forced him to retire early and he took it personally. he made the test for aids/hiv, hepatitis a,b, and c, west nile, and chagas’ disease. i just want to tell him i love him one last time..."
bipolar,depression,154,"i wrote a post on here a bit ago about the troubles i was having with my mom and my situation has gotten a lot worse. i owe her a lot of money, they were paying for my car, phone, and treatment. basically everything. i got so angry at her that i told her to and the only plan i ever had for it was finally going through with killing myself. even at my most stable, that was always the plan. so now i'm here. the worst has finally happened. i'm trying to find reasons not to go through with my plan and can't find any."
ptsd,bipolar,155,"i hate this disorder, i hate the people who did this to me, i hate the holidays, i hate knowing that no one is ever really going to actually care. when it comes down to it they just really don't. if i have to be so fucking lonely with this pain then i would rather just actually be alone then. i hate all of this."
adhd,bipolar,158,"i notice this a lot when i'm reading stuff for school. i have no other distractions around me. but i'll spend ten or fifteen minutes on a single paragraph because i physically cannot focus on it. i mean i can literally feel myself straining to process the words and, even though nothing else is going through my brain, i have reread over and over again. i'm not dyslexic, it has everything to do with my focus. it's almost like i hyperfocus on nothing as i'm reading. anyone else experience this?"
depression,ptsd,159,"this sub has helped me through my darkest times. even though i may not be fully healed, i am ready to leave the sub. thank you for everyone who helped me."
bipolar,ptsd,165,i had the worst one of my life tonight. i was psychotic and had a flashback to my attempt. multiple times. my hand was talking to me and telling me bad things. i have 3-4 nightmares a week and they aren't getting better. i don't know why this is happening.
adhd,none,171,"edit: i said this as a joke, but that was before i saw just how many people end up owing ridiculous amounts of money. i am 100% going to talk to my university library about this now."
ptsd,adhd,174,sensory goods. i bought one from them a few years ago and it’s great. im buying a second one for my grandson. they talked me into glass beads. i think it’s sand actually. this time i ordered it with plastic beads. then i’ll take whichever he doesn’t prefer. i hope it helps someone. anyways-here’s the code i just used. 20% off and free shipping. fb20
depression,anxiety,176,"i absolutely hate this statement. the thing is, i think you can love someone even if you don't love yourself, and that in itself can be the reason the relationship falls apart. ""why don't you feel good enough? i love you, why isn't that enough? iand can't change now. it's too much of a comfort to dislike myself. is that annoying to handle? probably. but, it doesn't change the fact that i can love someone with my whole heart and not feel an ounce of love for myself. can anyone else relate?"
ptsd,bipolar,178,"hi all! i run a general mental health peer support chatroom on discord for people 18\+. at over 2500 members, we still maintain a close community\-oriented atmosphere with rules ine or check out our instagram: we believe we are stronger together, which is why peer support is so helpful and important. care when you need it; care for others when you can. \-zen"
bipolar,anxiety,184,"i gotta vent. dad, you've been giving mixed compliments for the past week. backhanded praise and shit. ""i don't care if you fail, i care if you try."" too fucking bad dad, i care more if i fail than if i try, and i get that that doesn't get me anywhere; it feels pretty shitty to be reminded my ridiculous rejection sensitivity makes me a terrible person. fine, impedes my success. you didn't call me a terrible person. but that's what i'm getting at. the rejection sensitivity. what amounted to ""your not trying for the sake of avoiding getting hurt disappoints and irritates me"" turned into ""you're a terrible person."" or maybe i took it to mean ""you're broken."" i often think i am. how do you think it feels when i submit 10 job applications and my brain does the same thing about not hearing back? how do you think it feels to be constantly looking at jobs trying to balance what i'm qualified for, what won't be soul-crushingly mind-numbing, and what will actually move me forward in life? and then after beating myself up to get myself to start and continue that process, getting discouraged either not hearing back or hearing i didn't get the job. and then there's: what if i actually here back? interviews are std am now telling myself ""you're gonna be the lazy drug using social security beneficiary nobody wants to get their money"" while i tell myself i don't deserve it because i feel like a liar. but you know what? it may hurt, **but i take it on for you**. because i acknowledge my debilitating fear of trying on the job front and would rather take on shame than let my failure to launch weigh you down. when i was growing up, i used to tell myself ""no one can hurt you more than your own family."" i think that's still true for me today. thanks dad. *do you know why i changed therapists after you got your cancer diagnosis?* **i wanted to make sure you'd be proud of me before you died.** i sure as hell don't feel like you are right now. tl;dr: my dad hurt me and pissed me off by telling me he doesn't feel like i try and expressing frustration at how much time i put into videogames (where i can at least feel successful at **something**) when i spent less time on videogames today than half of what i spend most days in general. seriously, videogaming and weight loss are the only two things i've succeeded at since graduation. maybe not dying, too, but i don't think that should count. good to know i'm a disappointment."
depression,bipolar,186,"kinda shitty advice. but i'll start with some backstory. i'm on mobile so forgive me. (this will be kinda rambly) i was diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety disorder after i checked into a psychiatric hospital a few years back, but i always felt as i grew up that something was wrong. when i went to go meet my biological mother (who is very bipolar) when i was 18 things started to click with me that i needed to figure out a way to find meaning. it didn't help that my step-mom was an abusive cunt. so overall i kinda suck at being a person.(still do) anyways, i've struggled with constantly feeling down, and also feeling a whole lotta shit i didn't really understand. because of this i turned to weed and alcohol when i was 15. went through a few phases of drinking hard, but really weed was my poison of choice(still dont think it's bad but that's for another sub). again anyways because of the plant i kinda regained a sense of what it meant to be a healthy functioning member of society, but it was  pay the rent, things get complicated with family, with work, with life. and all of it together makes me wanna opt out. but then i think of leaving him by himself to deal with it himself and what a living hell that would be. even if i cant do much, ill do what i can till i can't. because if i dont that would make me sadder than anything i can ever encounter in my life. my point is that out there there are strong, amazing, incredibly intelligent and driven people, who do this shit alone. while feeling everything. and its heart breaking. my dad spent his life trying to make me feel welcome when every fiber of my being says i don't belong on this earth. the least i can do is gtfo bed and try to do something. even if my battle that day is just to brush my teeth. so that he can see a good looking smile that he made. to make him feel just a little better. that's my part, my mission. thats what gets me up. there are people that can use your help, and you owe it to them. but that s just my opinion."
anxiety,adhd,187,"hi guys, so yesterday i (23f) had my graduation and i asked my family to be there. i wanted to share this moment, but nothing big. i wanted to go to lunch with them,my food) it wasnt my day. but my sister (43) told me ( as everybody else tells me) 'dont whine. they mean well and suck it up' *tl;dr: is it sellfish?! is it really?*"
anxiety,depression,188,"hello all, i'm currently in a relationship with my boyfriend of 5 years. sometimes, i get so overwhelmed by how happy he makes me and how much i love him, that i get terrified. for some reason i feel like what we have is too good to be true, and i feel like the universe is manageable it has been in years. i have been taking zoloft for about 2 months now, and i've never felt better. however, i still have a lot of worries about certain things, like my boyfriend's safety for example, that haven't completely gone away. thanks for any advice guys.)"
none,adhd,191,"backstory: last week i broke my ankle and there's a cast around it. and also, i tend to be one of the lucky guys in india who lives with his girlfriend. but also unlucky in the sense that a handful of my relatives also live in delhi. here's a highlight of how my last 5 days have been when they visited * initially i had to endure gasps, shudders and shivers of them when they realize about my ""living arrangement"" and how ""apposit jendaars"" are not supposed to live together. * then i experienced a satisfaction almost equal to 1/10th of an orgasm when i saw their faces while they ""inform"" my dad(who couldn't give two shits about itntion- it was navratri and the maid had prepared chicken and rice in lunch so that was fun. * another honb'l mention: all of them know that i drink. because i got many of my cousins drunk in a family wedding some years back. but when they found the bottles and asked me whether she drinks or not and when i said yes she does. their immediate response was *but girls can't drink.* as if it's anatomically impossible for chicks to drink alcohol. and i am 24 btw. just for perspective for how ridiculous they are. also my mom told me last night that she got a call from everyone saying ""*ladka bohot open ho gaya hai. iski shaadi karado.*"""

adhd,none,209,"edit: i would say that a comparison to how a ""normal"" person functions is this - a normal can stand in the middle of the room and softly bounce the ball repeatedly off one wall, but i am only able to throw the ball with extra strength and it essentially shoots out of my hand and requires other walls to bounce to."

depression,bipolar,242,"that’s the best i can explain how i feel, i guess. it’s odd, but the only thing i’ve felt for a while now, so is strangely comforting due to its consistency. i feel as if i’m very detached from my own body, and am sometimes taken aback when i see myself ieverything (sometimes called creepily observant). i don’t know how to describe it, really. justa constant star of being “out of it”. i was just curious if anyone else feels the same way? let me know if you do and we can try and explain it to each other :)"

bipolar,depression,250,"like many of you, when i get depressed i tend to stay in my room, unshowered, and pass the days bingeing on netflix, hulu or amazon prime. i canceled netflix so i could afford movie pass. (i'm on a fixed income.) it's a subscription service that allows you to see one movie a day, every day, for $10 a month. (this is not an advertisement, just an idea. i don't work for movie pass.) i spoke to my private showing. so maybe if you're like me and love movies, a subscription service may be the thing to help you leave the house. amc theaters also has a subscription service for $20 a month if you can afford that. (this is in the us). sinema has plans starting at $4.99 a month. if you love movies and want to have a motivation to leave the house once in a while, this may be a good idea for you."

adhd,anxiety,309,"video games, weed, watching porn, eating fatty foods, drinking, etc. these are all things i find very hard to control. when i smoke a bit of weed i crave more instantly and i don't stop smoking until i'm baked out of my mind. whenever i'm feeling bad i start overeating, which leads to me feeling worse, which leads to more overeating. whenever i feel bored (which is quite often) i play video games. this leads to me using only video games for pleasure and to esccult emotions, and i dull myself with unhealthy behaviours, instead of just accepting the emotions and processing them in a healthy way. when i stop using these behaviours the negative thoughts and emotions start hitting me very hard. but probably that's just a phase you have to go through, to get out better on the otherside. are there others who struggle with balancing life like me? if you've found a solution, please elaborate. is this just a discipline thing?"

adhd,anxiety,328,"this scene has played out what seems like hundreds of time pretty big paper due at midnight. the thought process throughout the day: 2:00 pm: i have loads of time, no sweat. 3:00 pm: as long as i leave myself a solid 6-8 hours to finish i'll be fine. 4:00 pm: i really should start working, but the sun is still up, i'll be fine. 5:00 pm: shit why am i wasting so much time?! i need to start asap, but first let me make some food. 6:00 pm: okay all full and ready to start. but first lets just browse reddit quick before i start. 7:00 pm: f*** its getting so late,ay great, just gonna check reddit quick before bed. its all lies but i keep falling for it. this probably sounds like good old fashion procrastination, but i give in to even the tiniest distraction because i believe all the bs my brain tells me. the entire day i'm checking the clock and lying to myself. and this will happen for consecutive days. never do i say to myself, ""hey you lets not do that again."" instead i get ""yeah yesterday was a waste, but seriously you have all day. this is probably a rant but if anyone has any suggestions i'd be open to anything."

bipolar,adhd,725,"i was curious what people thought if it so far. the little activities have been interesting, but the questions they ask about if you did this or that on these medications has been somewhat useless to me. i've been on multiple medications for the majority of my adult life, so i don't always remember what caused what. i always assumed the brain fog was related to medication, and i was really kind of sad to find that the disorder causes it."
ptsd,bipolar,728,"too much horrible shit has happened to me in the past few weeks. one of the things i can't tell my parents. i have been going around house to house staying with other people because i want to avoid my parents. due to my other mental health issues, i still live at home at age 27 (i know,pathetic) and i feel like i can't be around them rig bitch to me. didn't care that i couldn't sleep. i had to go to the e.r. (i have medicaid) to get sleeping pills that actually work because she wouldn't return my call after giving my trazedone, which doesn't even work. i'm so angry at everyone. even my therapist who i told my problem to, i don't think he takes me seriously. i'm so tired."

depression,anxiety,730,"i’m 22, senior in college, and some days i’m in up to four classes. if i don’t have to work that day, work requires me to talk, i can go through the entire day with having little to no interaction with another human. no one texts me throughout the day, no one talks to me before or after classes, and i feel as though no one even looks at me when i walk down the street, beyond the cashier at the cafe telling me my coffee aned handsome in. the painful reality is that i felt even more alone today, more distant from the entire society of college that i wanted to run as far as i could away from it. people are always telling me that “if you want to make friends or meet a girl, you have to be the one to make that first conversation” but if that’s the case why isn’t any ever trying to make that conversation with me. thank-you for noticing me today."
adhd,depression,734,"well what a great feeling. for a while now i thought i just wasn't smart and i couldn't get a's. i got diagnosed recently and started medication/treatment, showing that maybe i'm not actually that stupid after all! don't get down on yourself if you feel this way, we aren't stupid/dumb we're different. knowing how your brain works is really helpful when it comes to learning."
bipolar,ptsd,741,"yesterday was rough. i broke things off with my ex the day before yesterday due to some toxic and manipulative behavior. he freaked out on me and has been sending me messages on every app possible saying some of the most horrible things imaginable up until yesterday evening when i blocked him on everything possible. we we're dating for 6 years and i feel so fucking dumb. it was obvious he was trying to hurt me and he didn't, but he den i said i didn't want to hang again he tried to blame me for his actions so i blocked him too. i think i'm ok emotionally, but what the fuck? idk why i keep attracting people like this. i just don't understand and i'm so sick of it. i'm a sweet person and i don't feel like i deserve it. anyway, i just wanted to vent about my fucking horrible day yesterday. it was a scary day. as always, you guys are wonderful people and thank you :)"

bipolar,ptsd,746,"so, as we all know, many managers are very unforgiving and aren't very keen on helping you out when you're not doing well. most of my past managers have treated me poorly, and when i tell them of my bipolar, they scheduled me less or looked at me differently, in a bad way. my current job as a manager, i cannot allow any of my emotions to clog me. and i'm quite good at it, especially since i've been put on medications that have made me so stable i often forget to worry about mood swings. but, a while ago, i was sexually assaulted and it comes and goes in waves all the ptsd stuff. but i deal and move on. a few days ago i had a completely meltdown at work and i couldn't shake it off. i went to the back and cr had blown up and i was angry and upset. i told him i would need a few days in november for court and he gave a look that wasn't the standard ""i'm so sorry"" look but the ""i'm surprised i didn't know"" look. and where i was going the entire time was, he told me if i ever needed pto that i could tell him. i didn't need to tell him what the court was about, but he told me that if i needed time, let him know. this guy i've fought with since day 1 understood my situation with clarity and empathy and told me to tell him if i needed pto. i didn't think that would ever happen, but it did. i appreciate him so much more than i did before. i love being validated and understood by someone who has never experienced this."
bipolar,depression,747,"last week i wore my hair up everyday to work. not because i particularly like the way it looks, but because i couldn’t will myself the effort to take a shower for 5 days. wearing my “depression” hoodie that is 3 sizes too big, just so i can ignore my weight issue and have it’s dog hair covered fabric drape around my already dirty pajama shirt that i wore the last 4 nights. being this kind of sad is funny that way even something as mundane and rudimentary as doing my laundry takes more effort f glitter about to explode taking shots at the bar with my friends and oversharing too much with too many people this happiness turns agitated and irritable every small inconvenience feels like i might just turn green, sprout some brown shorts and call myself hulk like a rubber band that is twisting tighter and tighter until it snaps. and cuts my arm with an exacto knife and down i fall again… when people ask me how i am they should just ask me who i am today and what does my laundry look like"

adhd,bipolar,774,"wow, i am overwhelmed by everyone's support! let me clarify a few things with some background info: after 4 1/2 long years, i graduate in a month. in fact, last night i was finishing up my capstone project that's due today and i was having the hardest time because i put half of it off until last minute and i'm stressed the fuck out. anyway, even though i made it through college, i'm now being faced with new challenges and a shit ton of deadlines. i'm graduating in a few weeks, yet i missed a doctors appointment recently because i forgot, still have trouble with not wasting my time for hours and have two labs that are kicking my ass and i can't keep up. however, this morning i woke up to a reminder that though it's an uphill battle, especially while managing bipolar disorder, that i really am doing better than i think. whether you're freshman in the same shoes i was in four years ago, or are thriving the career you worked your ass off for, your advice, encouragement and the courage to open up have inspired the hell out of me. every single one of you. that being said, i want to share something in return that i hope will encourage you as well: i was never a model student. i dicked around in high school (on the days i actually went lol). i was your standard class clown. my grades were average, but i was always late and had to work extra hard to keep up. senior year, i accepted that since nobody believed i would make it through my first year of college, it was probably true. my first year, i was eust like your heart, meaning mental health issues should be combatted just like you would any other part of your body. you can't just one day decide that because you've changed your mindset that you don't have heart disease, just like you can't do that with adhd. obviously. the good news is, is that together, by sharing our experiences and simple solutions, we can at least all go about this knowing that we are not alone. i understand not everyone has access to resources such as medication and therapy, and i truly respect anyone who has gone without. ultimately, it is coming to the realization that you are the one who has to initially seek help, which is hard when it's hard to do anything in the first place. if you are reading this, that means you are already one step ahead because you're on this subreddit. thank you to everyone who has taken the time to share your time management solutions, love and other things you've done that have helped you with daily tasks. these are valuable insights that can truly make a difference. i took some advice i read in a comment on another thread and had a productive day yesterday. it wasn't much, my damn it was satisfying when i looked at how much i'd crossed of my to-do list. alright, so i have to get back to my project but i could not ignore the outpouring of support from my fellow adhders. also, if anyone has any questions or just needs somebody to talk to, message me. i'm so glad i found this community. remember, you're awesome. go kick today's ass. cheers"

anxiety,ptsd,784,"my doctor and counselor have me listed as extreme anxiety and depression, early childhood ptsd, bi polar, borderline personality disorder. it's a relief to have an answer to what my problems are. this has been an on going problem my whole adult life. my first job, i had reasons for being depressed. i dropped out of school, parents were divorcing and i didn't have a stable housing situation, i was falling behind and depressed, full of anger and anxiety. i didn't want to call myself weak though and admit i had a problem, so i attempted to self medicate by escaping reality. i skateboarded, played video games, drank, smoked weed, partied, did everything i could to feel numb. 5 years later, because i didn't seek help or medication early on, i was put on suicide watch due to my new medications not worki application. my point to all this is i would be homeless and probably dead without her. she has saved my ass countless times over the years,having a mental illness makes holding a job so fucking difficult, i've lost at least 6 jobs since being with her. i have nothing but respect and love for her to be putting up with all this, while we are both still fairly young (i'm 24, she's 21 later this year) i wish her parents understood mental illness, but it's kind of a taboo in her family so we keep things as vague as possible. i just hope that i get through to disability services and can make an income that way, to relieve some stress from her life. she put off school for me from the very beginning, the least i can do is help her get through school. sorry about the rant. i hope everyone has a great day."
ptsd,adhd,786,"i typed out a whole long vent post but then realized i really just wanted to know if anyone else had the same problem. my ex is the first out of many different guys who respected my boundaries and always made sure that our sex was fully consensual. we dated for a year, broke uherapy and that i will eventually find a man i can trust, although i am worried that i'll run into the wrong men before i find him. i'm just curious - how many of you have gotten too attached to people who treated you well after your diagnosis (or after you developed symptoms)?"

ptsd,depression,880,"i feel completely trapped in my own head. i've had that ""chair is about to fall backward"" feeling day in and day out for like three weeks now. it's becoming exhausting. i feel like a thousand screaming emotions are trapped behind a stone exterior. i can't cry or yell or write. i can't express any emotions, even for moms most of the time, it's just particularly bad right now and trying to out-logic my emotions is just overwhelming sometimes. right now is one of those times. you guys are my people and i guess i'm not really looking for solutions, just someone to remind me that it will pass and maybe offer up some tips on self-care."

anxiety,ptsd,1176,"my wife passed out from a panic attack yesterday in the theatre while we were watching *a quiet place*. i was so scared and didn't know what to do. about an hour into the movie, there's a scene where someone steps on a nail. it wasn't even very gory, but i guess it triggered some bad memories for her. a few seconds after that scene, my wife's arm started twitching kind of like a seizure. at the same time, she started making sounds like she was snoring or maybe choking. when i looked at her, her head was lolled to the side and her eyes were closed. not realizing what was happening, i nudged her a bit, thinking she had fallen asleep. when her head rolled to the other side and there wasn't any other response my concern sky-rocketed. i took her head in my hands and gently shook her a little bit trying to wake her up. her eyes partially opened, and i could see her pupils were looking up like when you roll your eyes. there was no other response. i tilted her head forward and the ""snoring"" sound stopped, but she was still unconscious. at this point, about half a minute or so had passeder feel safe. i tried to just hold her and comfort her. after about a half hour she was doing better. i felt so helpless when she was unconscious. it's very scary when you suddenly realize your loved one is having a medical emergency. later in the evening, she revealed to me that when she was a teenager, she had an abusive boyfriend that would rape her, cut her with a scalpel, and poke her with needles. sick stuff like that i guess. she wouldn't say much more about it than that. i am angry. not at her, but at the thought some sicko did this to her. and i hurt. i grieve that she has experienced something so traumatic it causes this type of thing. she agreed we will get her into some therapy. she needs healing that i never knew she needed. i also know this isn't about me, but i feel a bit hurt this is just now coming out. we've been married about 5 years, and i never knew this stuff. what else don't i know? i don't know what type of advice i'm looking for. how can i be there for her? how can i help? what do i do if this happens again? did i do the right thing both during and after?"

bipolar,depression,1349,"title says it all. i was bombarded this morning by my boss, essentially belittling me in front of the entire office. i sucked up like the man i am, and sat down behind my desk. and then it hit how that felt. i ran to the back half of the office, stood out in secluded section of the warehouse and wept. granted it was for only about 30 seconds, i haven't felt such relief in so long."

depression,ptsd,1364,i hate the fact that euthanasia is not legal in the u.s. imagine being severely sick and suffering and people forcing you to stay alive. that seems like a form of torture to me. i wish guns where legal were i live i would have killed myself a long time ago.
bipolar,adhd,1365,"i have been struggling so much to take this exam for my mba program. the course material was truly terrible, but i also just... couldn't face it. i had no confidence. i was avoiding it at all costs. well last night i did it! i sucked it up, scheduled my exam, and nailed it. i have a little bit more work to do, but i am now extremely close to finishing my masters degree and i just have to ride this wave to the end."
depression,anxiety,1371,"which is wack, because we're all a bunch of strangers hiding behind usernames. but this is such a common theme for me. for example, if someone passes me on the freeway, i immediately assume it's because that person is angry at me and wants to run me over. where is this line of thinking coming from? is it anxiety? i've been depressed for 13 years and this ""everybody hates me empirically"" has only surfaced in the last 1-2 years. anyone else deal with this?"
anxiety,depression,1375,"been in a bad way the past couple of years, stuck in a rut with no light at the end of the tunnel. there’s been many times i thought about suicide. the other day i just thought fuck it i’m making something of myself, so step 1 of that was contributing to society (get a job), step 2 is to move to a better area somewhere i can feel more happy and fulfilled. still not out of the woods yet but i’m trying given the terrible circumstances."

depression,ptsd,1382,"nothing is wrong in particular in my life, i have a couple things that are kinda down. but nothing i can say should be making me have such a bad reaction to it. if you want to know, i ha find a new job. however i am finding myself thinking even worse than usual about cutting my throat open and bleeding to death. the image in my mind is quite graphic, more so than normal."
adhd,anxiety,1385,every single day it's the same. i'm 2 minutes late which has me run the way to the train station. it's always those 2 minutes. i hate it. i start hating myself for it. it keeps happening. why? and who else? how do you cope? it's a common pattern btw. also includes deadlines and other things. i'm always the exact amount of time late to make things uncomfortable.
none,adhd,1389,"maybe this way of saying it is fine, but when people ask around and compare test scores, i genuinely believe and want to tell people that they shouldn't focus on what other people scored but focus on themselves and their own work. i don't want to sound too formal or even rude since i am a student. so how should i reply to people asking whatever test mark i received?"
depression,bipolar,1390,i've been in a major depressive episode for the last two years or so and lately i find myself only brushing my teeth maybe once a day and showering only once a week. i was just wondering if anyone else struggles with this at different times during a depressive episode.
anxiety,depression,1396,"the older i get, the worse i seem to be at, i don't know, functioning in general. i used to be really sociable, have plenty of friends, i did well in school, had hobbies and interests - i was weird, but enough people liked me that i didn't think about it. after high school it was like the blinders were taken off and i started to see all these things about myself that i really, really hated. i started struggling a lot in social situations, i flunked out of a really good university, i couldn't hold a job, i gradually lost contact with my friends... i was a mess. but i got back up. it was a little harder than before but i still had enough momentum to keep going. i moved back to my ollet myself become. i think a big part of my problems is that i'm so used to trying and failing that i'm afraid that's the only outcome if i try again. i look at myself and think ""i've given up,"" because i have. i don't want to! but i don't know how to make life work for me anymore. i don't know how to connect with people. i go out somewhere and it's impossible to think or talk clearly through the static in my head that makes me nauseous and stutter and my heart pound. what kind of a life is one where you can't even talk to someone without turning into an idiot or crying after? i can't function like this. i'll never be able to work like this. has anyone overcome a similar situation?"

adhd,bipolar,1420,"sorry, this is long. so, just like the title says, i cleaned my room yesterday. i mean, i really cleaned it. it was disorganized and always messy and it had been driving me nuts for probably a year. i made a deal with my husband that every saturday we would choose one area of the house and purge it and really scrub it. we've lived in our house for 6years and we neaten it here and there, clean it up better when company comes, but we've never really gone room by room and sorted everything and purged all the old stuff and scrubbed the corners and walls and stuff. so this is pretty embarrassing, but i normally use natural cleaners for everything except the toilet and i've never really scrubbed everything hard- just surface cleaning here and there to get it a step above unsanitary and gross. yesterday i broke out the big guns and used an entire brand new can of scrubbing bubbles just on my makeup counter and toilet/shower area (our house was built in the 70's and our sink is in our bedroom opposite another counter vanity for make up, and the toilet and shower are in a tiny little room with a pocket door). you guys, i dusted everything, scrubbed the window frames, washed the windows, cleaned our lampshades inside and out including the bulbs. i scrubbed all the baseboards, washed and reorganized my medicine cabinet shelves and cabinet drawers, sctackling their bedrooms. little by little we're going to make our way through the whole house and de-clutter and organize it. it's such a daunting task, but just knowing how good it feels to get it done is huge motivation! i'm also trying to not berate myself for letting it get so bad. cleaning is probably my least favorite activity ever, but i feel so good when things are picked up and cleaned. i know it's better for my mental health and feeling in control, too. more motivation to get rid of a lot of extra crap taking up room in my life! tl;dr-cleaned my room and it was much worse than i'd realized. motivated to keep the momentum going and get the rest of the house in order. edit:: i thought i should give an update! it has been three weeks and my room is still clean! i can't even believe it, but it is!!! dh and i both also clean all three of our kids rooms and i cleared up a lot of launfry today. i can't even begin to tell you how motivating it is to get this done. i think i've reached a point where i actually want to clean things up because of how nice it feels! we still have some pretty major sections of the house to work our way through and it will be a chore to get the kids to be more cognizant of their rooms, but after three saturdays of committing to this it feels like i'm almost at the stage of making it a new normal! *happy dance!*"
ptsd,depression,1426,"cw: suicide, violence, law enforcement, child abuse... i cried on my way to work after i bought my coffee. i saw the sunrise and started crying because i thought about the people i couldn't save because i wasn't good enough, they won't get to live and see a sunrise. or enjoy a coffee in the morning. that hurt (i worked with certain organizations i can't name for obvious reasons tracking human traffickers for some context. anyone in law enforcement, or first responders probably know you can't save everyone no matt night too. i cried at home because i just needed to. i think i just needed a day but i had meetings. ive been feeling so helpless that i can't even bother to feed myself, ive lost so much weight. i think i want to die but i have friends that have committed suicide too. and i don't want to put my friends through the pain i felt. today was a bad day and i wanted to bitch about it, welcome to my shit show ladies and gentlemen. i'm weak now, i don't have any more mental fortitude left. i hope your day was better :)"

none,adhd,1434,"hey guys, so i had a little check up in class in which i got 7/10 points. i wanted to ask if the 3 points i wasn't given are justified. 1. we should translate the german equivalent for ""when someone is sick and he makes the transition from being into working life to being on sick leave"" into english. i wrote ""to go into sick leave"". hkes enough money to live, from doing something"" i wrote: ""make a living out of something"". when i asked my teacher about it she just gave me a weird look and told me that i had apparently used the wrong preposition, she said it's to be ""make a living from something"". i am convinced that both are possible. tell me reddit, what's right?"
bipolar,adhd,1435,"[my last so i asked for some useful website ideas i could build for our community here and i got a few awesome replies that i’ve taken under consideration. my main goal here is to build something that people (especially newcomers) will actually use. **i want it to be a place of happy, positive and organized information.** /u/fitsofthefather suggested building a section of medication and treatment related info that’s backed by research and studies. i want to hold off on that fidence boosting scripts that you can recite to yourself in times of need. it seems like a lot, but it’ll fit into one website. my only question is would it benefit this community and do you see it being useful? if so, i will need a few people to consult regarding information for the website and if anyone wants a place to blog you’re welcome to blog here! everything will be anonymous unless you want otherwise. thanks everyone. edit: thanks so much to /u/tosher23 for the gold!"

bipolar,adhd,1438,"so i seem to be having issues with unichem pharmaceuticals lamtrigine and called my pharmacy, they told me that they could switch me to another generic but it would take an extra day to get it (i live in a large city so this may vary according to locality). they also asked me which one i wanted, so you can actually *choose* the company, if you know which one works best for you you can ask for it. ymmv depending on your pharmacy, mine is good. when i mentioned my issue they said i could switch without hesitation and ll of this information is new to them. so even branches in the same pharmacy chain can have wildly different experiences. it's nuts. i love love love my pharmacy! i'm scared that i'll lose them or the manager or pharmacists will change or something! i have seen different employees there but the quality of service is consistent. maybe it's strange but whenever something good comes along in my life i'm terrified i'll lose it and get thrown back to the wolves again. do people have things consistently good in their life?"
none,adhd,1444,"hi everyone! first things first. a bit of background: having been studying english for almost seven years, i passed cae in 2015 and subsequently passed cpe in 2018 (got a). after the proficiency exam, i managed to create some sort of language bubble around me. i have at least six hours of speaking practice weekly. i keep learning some new words and expressions. i read for at least an hour every day. i am an avid writer. i dabble with poetry and short stories (i post some on reddit and elsewhere). perhaps it may sound sacrilegious to some, but i don't really see c2 as some kind of pinnacle. i reached it a while ago. since then, i seem to have somewhat improved my writing (which, in t also feels like you've reached a plateau and now you're crawling rather than leapfrogging towards some new level. and that's fine. i'm going to retake this exam this year or maybe next year, just to keep my language alive and kicking. i put too much time and effort into it, and it would be too profligate of me to lay it all to waste. what do you think, folks? your opinions are welcome. nb. i am working as a chemical engineer. there's not much opportunity for me to apply my english at work, let alone at a level that high. i participate in and contribute to some local off-line speaking clubs, but, truth be told, they do not really challenge me. and i want something duly challenging."
adhd,bipolar,1448,"i mean it was obviously an incredibly productive day. i had a good night's rest, meds, and caffeine on board for the potent triple-threat... that i failed to aim at schoolwork and cleaning the apartment. *balls.* at least i remembered to eat lunch."

adhd,bipolar,1450,"apologies for the use of that word in this post, for those who might be sensitive to it. *edit again* copy/pasting a comment to another user: where i'm from people use it as a slur toward the autism community. i'm actually not even sure it's just where i'm from - i see it all over the internet too. i don't personally think they're synonymous but since i witness ""autistic"" and ""retarded"" being used in the same sentence by shitty people all the time, i only wanted to be clear that i don't feel the same way and that i don't want to hurt anyone with my post :( that's why i had previously written that i don't use that word, nor would i ever call someone that anywt. but when i argue with my boyfriend i can barely remember what i've just said...i can't always remember how the argument even started. i get really flustered and then that gets worse. all i seem to hear is ""you're wrong."" i'm not always good at getting across what i mean the first time, either. so in frustration last night, my boyfriend asked me ""are you retarded?"" and it honestly hurt me a bit. i know some of you have had people ask you that. you start giving the question some thought because you feel you can't do anything right, ever. i'm not sure why i'm making this post...just feeling down in general. fucks with me every time, when someone asks me that."

adhd,bipolar,1462,"i was just diagnosed last week (at 36 years old) and have been reading a lot, trying to understand this thing that i've unknowingly been battling for my entire life. this small section in the book driven to distraction by edward m. hallowell m.d. spoke to me so strongly i thought i would share in hopes that it might speak to others on the same path. it's a quote from one of his patients. &gt; “oh,” she answered, “that is about a cough drop someoneto greet me when i got into the car the next morning, jeff was with me. i looked at the cough drop and burst into tears. jeff asked me why i was crying, and i told him it was because of the cough drop. he thought i was losing my mind. ‘but you don’t understand,’ i said, ‘my whole life is like that. i see something that i mean to do and then i don’t do it. it’s not only trivial things like the cough drop; it’s big things, too.’ that is why i cried.”"
