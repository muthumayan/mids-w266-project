adhd,bipolar,1,"only you would appreciate this nobody else in my life would understand this but i know you guys would. all my life i have been shit at school and academic learning. i've been medicated for almost two years now. i heard today that my assignment for a professional qualification scored 80%, one of the highest marks given. i could never have done that prior to treatment. i am so god damn proud of myself."
depression,ptsd,3,"had my (first) first date, girl blocked me everywhere and i feel horrible i'm 20, never had a girlfriend and basically gave up on trying dating girls for all the rejections i got. one day i meet this girl, pretty cute one too. she actually started the conversation for some informations but we kept talking and talking and in the end i asked her number. we messaged a little bit, she sounded so enthusiastic all the time. i thought i was ready to try getting into a relationship, set my depressing thoughts aside, i even forgot i found myself to be ugly... so i just had my first date. during that moment, i felt the happiest i've t her a sms telling her to write or call back when she can. nothing. weeks passed and my mind is still full of doubts and i can't stop worrying about what i did wrong and why she did this, and my depression has gotten way worse. i don't know what to think. did something go wrong? does she just not find me attractive at all?has she already found someone? why did she even bother? i honestly want an answer but i'm so frustrated that i can't get one back. i feel like i was so close to something so special and it's already gone. nightmares are waking me up. i'm too weak for this stuff, i have no idea how other people handle this."
depression,bipolar,6,"failed 2 classes. now i’m on academic suspension. i really let it get out of hand this time folks. i got an email today saying i’m being excluded from my academics (meaning won’t be able to go to class...) because i didn’t pass 2 of my classes. so now, my choices are 1. talk to the dean to see if i qualify for a cancellation of exclusion, 2. get suspended, or 3e to the absolute limit. i’m not sure if i’ll be able to take it. i can’t live with my parents again. my dad doesn’t believe in mental illness whatever that means. thinking about this situation makes me hate everything. im so done with life. i don’t know why i even try anymore. i knew i wasn’t cut out for college and i might as well give up and go waitress again"
adhd,bipolar,11,"after over a month unemployed, i finally have a really promising interview this morning. so my last job was kind of a shit-show. i was having real issues with focus and staying interested at my last-last job (this was before i was diagnosed) and going through a lot of personal stuff in my life (divorce) i wanted to make more money, and get a change, and prove to my ex that i was capable. i let pride blind me, and i applied for a job as an embedded engineer with a local company. well... due to moving needs in the company, they decided they didn't really need an embedded guy at the time, and brought me on as a c# software developer to try me out. i volunteered on a large scale embedded projec wasn't a need anywhere for my talents at day's end. i'm honestly pretty sure he was surprised as i was that i was let go, but the decision was made way above his head. i was pretty fuckin' bummed for the last month. anyway. just got a call yesterday from a small company looking to bring on a senior fpga engineer to lead their satellite technology development, and i believe i'm perfect for the role. i've always wanted to put stuff in to space, so i'm very stoked right now. i'm hoping the interview goes well, and that i manage to impress them. i could really use the win right now. also, now that i've got the meds, and i've got the right therapy, i really think this will be my chance to shine."
anxiety,bipolar,12,"it actually can get better have just come of my meds last month after managing to travel the world for a year on my own and then staring my first year at university. years ago i physically couldn’t leave the house for months at a time out of fear, now i am a completely new person. you can beat this, no matter how long it takes."
adhd,depression,16,not wanting to be a problem sometimes makes things worse. was anyone else reminded of what a burden and a distraction they were to the point that now they go to moronic lengths not to inconvenience anyone? i often do this and it always makes things worse. any coping strategies?
adhd,bipolar,17,"i missed the exit on the interstate for work this morning and i didn't realize it until i had crossed the state line. i was already running late (of course) and i don't know what happened to me. i've done this before (missed exits, turns) but i usua why am i like this? why can't i just have a brain like a normal person? i'm sorry, i don't normally let this stuff get to me but for some reason i'm really taking this hard. anyway, thanks for letting me get that off my chest. you guys are the best."
bipolar,anxiety,20,"how many times do we deserve to ask for help? i am in grad school. i have two assignments to do before the end of the month and i'm not gonna do them. one was due dec 15, last year! accessibility services helped me get an extension to april 30. i haven't done any work on it. the anxiety is so high about it i'm not going to get it done. and i can't work on the other one, because then i'm not working on that one. i've sought help from accessibility servic myself out of the water. how many times do i get to ask for help? its not fair. i'm taking resources from the people who ask for help and then actually make use of it. the cycle is just going to continue. depression, procrastinate, anxiety, depression, ask for extension, depression, procrastinate, anxiety, depression. i hate it. it doesn't stop. my thoughts keep arriving at the only way to make it all stop entirely. but i don't want that. i don't think."
ptsd,anxiety,24,"how does everyone hold a job? so i've always had the anxiety and depression issues now my ptsd is such so hard to cope with. i got laid off at my last company for taking too much time off and spend about 6 months on paid benefits hoping to get a bit better. started my first day back at work and i'm living in hell all day. can't escape thed my anxiety is biological could i maybe get disability? also curious as to what everyone here actually does for work, i'm in construction and have been all my life practically. starting to think the custom work is too much stress and not worth the money anymore. needed this vent to get things off my chest a bit just feeling so frustrated."
anxiety,adhd,30,"does anyone have trouble sitting still and have to occupy yourself? i can't sit still when i get my eyebrows done, and when i'm in class i usually doodle to focus. i pay attention very well in school regardless of that, and drawing helps me focus."
adhd,depression,34,"why can't i do ""unhealthy"" stuff responsibly? video games, weed, watching porn, eating fatty foods, drinking, etc. these are all things i find very hard to control. when i smoke a bit of weed i crave more instantly and i don't stop smoking until i'm baked out of my mind. whenever i'm feeling bad i start overeating, which leads to me feeling worse, which leads to more overeating. whenever i feel bored (which is quite often) i play video games. this leads to me using only vial with difficult emotions, and i dull myself with unhealthy behaviours, instead of just accepting the emotions and processing them in a healthy way. when i stop using these behaviours the negative thoughts and emotions start hitting me very hard. but probably that's just a phase you have to go through, to get out better on the otherside. are there others who struggle with balancing life like me? if you've found a solution, please elaborate. is this just a discipline thing?"
bipolar,anxiety,35,"cried for the 1st time in over 5 years title says it all. i was bombarded this morning by my boss, essentially belittling me in front of the entire office. i sucked up like the man i am, and sat down belmost forgot how that felt. i ran to the back half of the office, stood out in secluded section of the warehouse and wept. granted it was for only about 30 seconds, i haven't felt such relief in so long."
adhd,bipolar,41,"""are you retarded?"" apologies for the use of that word in this post, for those who might be sensitive to it. *edit again* copy/pasting a comment to another user: where i'm from people use it as a slur toward the autism community. i'm actually not even sure it's just where i'm from - i see it all over the internet too. i don't personally think they're synonymous but since i witness ""autistic"" and ""retarded"" being used in the same sentence by shitty people all the time, i only wanted to be clear that i don't feel the same way and that i don't want to hurt anyone with my post :( that's why i had previously written that i don't use that word, nor would i ever call somngelist. but when i argue with my boyfriend i can barely remember what i've just said...i can't always remember how the argument even started. i get really flustered and then that gets worse. all i seem to hear is ""you're wrong."" i'm not always good at getting across what i mean the first time, either. so in frustration last night, my boyfriend asked me ""are you retarded?"" and it honestly hurt me a bit. i know some of you have had people ask you that. you start giving the question some thought because you feel you can't do anything right, ever. i'm not sure why i'm making this post...just feeling down in general. fucks with me every time, when someone asks me that."
ptsd,anxiety,47,"help i have not seen war first hand but have had terrible things happen to me. the police in my area won't do anything about it,a while back i had someone pull a gun on me and i will remember the type of the gun till the day i die, it was a .357 magnum 5 shot revolver with pearl grips and loaded with jacketed hollow points. and the bad thing is i can't afford to move and we have had several b and es in our area and i fear for my life on a daily...if anyone has some type of help i would be so thankfull."
none,anxiety,48,"first hostel of my trip and i'm sick and got bed bugs. i'm feeling very discouraged. i have a fever, sore throat and cold and my bunk mates and i confirmed we have bed bug bites this morning. the hostel confibed but i did get bitten. not sure if the washing machine will fit my bag. i have only been on this trip 4 days and while the travelling has been amazing, bed bugs and sick to start off with has been horrible."
depression,ptsd,54,"it's time for me to go. i've joined this sub-reddit filled with pure agony with all the things i've experienced in school, family, and myself. but eversince this year, i've managed to find love, gain my old friends with a handful of new ones, and i've finally become academically stabant days of wanting to dissapear and hoping for death to come. i thank you guys for helping me in a way that is unnoticable but very remarkable, i hope that i won't be alone in getting out. it's very pretty here i hope that i get to meet you all once again. music helped me alot too :)"
ptsd,bipolar,58,"i visited a psychiatrist today for the first time. this was my first time to share my story with other people. i was quite seriously addicted to taking drugs as self-mll in the making of decision to see psychiatrist, go for it. i feel like for the first time in my life, i took a step to change my life. (sorry if my english is bad...)"
adhd,depression,60,"stuck in a shitty cycle of motivation and depression i get really excited about an idea or something and im motivated about it . when it comes time to apply to it (job, student org), i get depressed and don't do well. then afterwards i regret. i keep getting rejected from everything. i'm really fucking upset and the people around me are really fucking tired of hearing me cry all the time. anyone else feel this way"
adhd,depression,64,"annoyed at literally everything does anyone else ever just get pissed off at anything that happens some days? like, the tv remote falls off your counter and it's just a pain even though it will take less than a second to pick up and fix or how about constantly having to piss because you drink an excessive amount of water per day and you just can't be fked going all the time? just me..? ok"
ptsd,depression,67,"i cried several times today cw: suicide, violence, law enforcement, child abuse... i cried on my way to work after i bought my coffee. i saw the sunrise and started crying because i thought about the people i couldn't save because i wasn't good enough, they won't get to live and see a sunrise. or enjoy a coffee in the morning. that hurt (i worked with certain organizations i can't name for obvious reasons tracking human traffickers for some context. anyone in law enforcement, or first responders probably know you can't sdrunk last night too. i cried at home because i just needed to. i think i just needed a day but i had meetings. ive been feeling so helpless that i can't even bother to feed myself, ive lost so much weight. i think i want to die but i have friends that have committed suicide too. and i don't want to put my friends through the pain i felt. today was a bad day and i wanted to bitch about it, welcome to my shit show ladies and gentlemen. i'm weak now, i don't have any more mental fortitude left. i hope your day was better :)"
none,adhd,81,i have aspergers and want to fly out to see my long distance boyfriend however i’ve never flown by myself before. my aspergers makes me worry unnecessarily and over think things. i’ i get there? how the heck do i know where to go and what plane to get on? it all sounds so confusing and i keep thinking about it. is it easy to get lost and miss my flight? thanks!
anxiety,ptsd,83,"can someone make me (21f) feel better? i feel humiliated :( i’ve had the worst week of my life. pretty much lost the will to live. my anxiety has been at a all time high since i calmed it down a while ago. as seen via my last post i got sexually assaulted nearly 7 days ago and i’ve been going off the rails ever since. i’ve barely been sober and have been promiscuous which i’ve never been before and i have no idea why after my assault all i want it for boys to respect me and say the right things before any sexual activity occurs. i had a boy say to me he wanted to get to know me before we had sex even though it was a one night stand and if it wasn’t for that nothing would of happened between us. it gave me at the time some false sense of security knowing i’m worth something and i’m not actually just a disposable machine that’s only good for one thing and that’s it? i went out last nigely humiliated, i know a few of them don’t like me that’s evident and i’m not sure why because i’ve not personally met any of them that don’t seem to like me, a lot of it has to be because of the guy i used to see and another guy i used to see who was also there. there was also drama as on friday someone slyly took a picture of me with a boy who had his arm around me who has a girlfriend (which i didn’t know) so everyone knows it’s me but they’re only not saying anything because the boy would fight all of them and probably win and his girlfriend showed up and punched him in the face and said he cheated on her, so i was quite a big topic of conversation in that apartment clearly and it’s giving me such bad anxiety i’m just worrying what people think of me and what was said about me i just don’t know what to do... i feel like i need to redeem myself but yet i’ve just done nothing wrong?"
ptsd,anxiety,86,just stopped myself from going into a full blown panic attack and he didn’t even notice. i was sitting at the kitchen table and my husband was standing over me trying to give me a high-five… he thrust his hand out so quickly at me i got triggered and started to tear up and breathe very heavily. now normalx years and he didn’t even notice... i asked him just now how he felt about me not spiraling into a panic attack and being able to come myself down this tim all he said was “ that was nice.” i needed to share with you guys because i have no one else in this world. for a moment i was really proud of myself.
anxiety,bipolar,96,i'm better. like for real better. i started effexor and therapy about 5-6 weeks ago and feel happy and so much less stressed. i wasn't depressed before so that wasn't an issue for me but the anxiety (gad and ocd) made me feel consumed. i am still titrating the medicine andcompulsion of going back out to re-lock them. the therapy helps so much too because being genuinely heard and not judged is so refreshing. there's no point in my post other than to let others know there's hope and to not give up on your journey to a life with less anxiety.
anxiety,depression,105,"i'm so tired of people and human interaction i love my friends and family don't get me wrong. but along with my social anxiety, i grow more and more irritated with people. way. sometimes i just want to shut everything off and be alone for a million years. to say things more clearly, i'm tired of everyone's shit. does that make me a bad person?"
ptsd,anxiety,110,"i can’t deal with it anymore i’m in a long distance relationship so i can only see my boyfriend if i stay at his house or he comes to mine. his family recently impulsively adopted an extremely poorly behaved dog. i’m currently at his house where she has completely scratched up my skin, had bitten my toes and one finger so badly it’s swollen, and purposely targets me and jumps on me all the time. because of what happened to me, i’m terrified of anything or anyone who has previously done  think i’m overreacting, despite knowing what happened to me so i told my boyfriend that that’s it. i cannot come back to his house until she gets better obedience classes and stops attacking people. am i overreacting in the moment or do you think this is completely justifiable? he’s frustrated with me for making that decision and i don’t even know what to do anymore. i’m sick of being attacked over literally doing nothing but this would mean i don’t get to see him or his family as much."
ptsd,adhd,114,"memory issues i’m so tired of having bad memory, it makes me feel so stupid. i’ve been watching the star wars movies with my boyfriend for the last week and how i can forget a detail from 20 minutes ago. i’m just sad. i use to have great memory and now i can’t even enjoy entertainment. i just feel like a shell."
bipolar,adhd,117,bipolar and adhd *update* a little while ago i made a post where i was wondering whether my adhd-like symptoms where caused by bipolar or if i actually have adhd. wfied that i'm not incompetent. hopefully i can make progress from here. i'm glad for some of the motivation you guys gave me in my original posts. thanks for reading
depression,bipolar,138,"why is everything so fucking hard now that i've struggles with this bullshit for 7 years, i've come to the realisation that literally no one cares no one is genuinely there for you. everyone will claim to be there for you and beg you to open up to them because they want todays on end because you just can't quite bring yourself to talk to people. going through days of mania followed by weeks of lowness and having people expect you to be okay because of those few days of mania everyone wants to be there for you until you actually show symptoms"

ptsd,adhd,140,just bought another weighted blanket-just wanted to share the deal i found. sensory goods. i bought one from them a few years ago and it’s great. im buying a second one for my grandson. they talked me into glass beads. i think it’s sand actually. this time i ordered it with plastic beads. then i’ll take whichever he doesn’t prefer. i hope it helps someone. anyways-here’s the code i just used. 20% off and free shipping. fb20
depression,anxiety,142,"i made it out alive y’all :’)) it’s been 4 days since my last suicide attempt. maybe 5-6 days since i stopped self harming, and a day or two since i completely stopped having everyday thoughts of death. yestabit of things, and slowly becoming the person i was before. all i can say in the end is fuck anxiety and fuck depression. all they did was drag me down and i’m so glad to be strong enough to make it through."
ptsd,bipolar,151,"i can’t believe i lost her..... i am so tired of fighting. this illness has taken everything from me. i’ve fucking tried the self help books, ive tried therapy, i’ve tried emdr, i’ve tried meditation and mindfulness, i’ve tried sobriety. everything just keeps getting worse. and now i lost the only thingry waking minute, using drugs, finding drugs, or buying drugs. i’m fucking done guys. i give up. i’m done trying i’m done pretending things get better, i’m done trying to pull my pathetic ass out from the dirt. thanks for being such a great community over the years. throw away account for obvious reasons"
anxiety,depression,152,"motivational speakers: do they upset anyone else? i just saw a motivational speech tonight. the speech was fine, good advice, well written. but i left it feeling so hopeless and almost in tears. here's this guy who's wealthy, driven, positive, and fit previous ones. i feel like a fucking negative nancy and that by not fixing that *right now,* i'm sabotaging my own life. i don't feel motivated right now. i sort of want to curl up into a ball. does anyone else react this way to motivational speeches?"
depression,bipolar,155,"everyday is the same fuckin day. i don't even feel sad much at all anymore, just numb. almost everything is boring and pointless now. i was diagnosed with major dnd apathetic. i don't even feel like myself anymore and i hate it, i feel like i've had my emotions and motivation taken from me. now all i wanna do is lay in bed."
ptsd,depression,166,i got a phone call today and im getting a call to sort out a counsellor im so happy man. i was kinda a dumb teenager who figured i could “do it myself” but now as a adult i know i can’t do that so i’m super excited to be getting help. ahhhhhh
ptsd,bipolar,169,"i'm not afraid. i don't feel anything. the most i'm granted is the sick, gut churning nausea that nearly comes up but i force myself to swallow. i either feel sick, or nothing. i never truly sleep. and i wake up wishing i wouldn't. just needed to vent. thanks for listening."
anxiety,ptsd,170,"recently i've been diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses that have led to me being fired from my job. my doctor and counselor have me listed as extreme anxiety and depression, early childhood ptsd, bi polar, borderline personality disorder. it's a relief to have an answer to what my problems are. this has been an on going problem my whole adult life. my first job, i had reasons for being depressed. i dropped out of school, parents were divorcing and i didn't have a stable housing situation, i was falling behind and depressed, full of anger and anxiety. i didn't want to call myself weak though and admit i had a problem, so i attempted to self medicate by escaping reality. i skateboarded, played video games, drank, smoked weed, partied, did everything i could to feel numb. 5 years later, because i didn't seek help or medicationn test, then i can finish my sdi application. my point to all this is i would be homeless and probably dead without her. she has saved my ass countless times over the years,having a mental illness makes holding a job so fucking difficult, i've lost at least 6 jobs since being with her. i have nothing but respect and love for her to be putting up with all this, while we are both still fairly young (i'm 24, she's 21 later this year) i wish her parents understood mental illness, but it's kind of a taboo in her family so we keep things as vague as possible. i just hope that i get through to disability services and can make an income that way, to relieve some stress from her life. she put off school for me from the very beginning, the least i can do is help her get through school. sorry about the rant. i hope everyone has a great day."
adhd,depression,171,"been staying 15-30 minutes past the end of my shift every day. showed up 3 minutes late this morning and was told i need to “try harder.” yeah, i’ll try harder. and i’ll also try extra hard to leave on time today instead of sticking around past the point where they’re actually paying me to be here."
depression,anxiety,173,"does anyone else have an imaginary world to cope? does anyone else have a world in their head? this completely imaginary world where people you like are your friends or characters from fiction are real? it helps me cope but at the same time it makes me very depressed because i'll always be chasing for someone like the people i made up in my head. they're basically imaginary friends. i have five friends in my ""head world"". three are characters i made up, keres, macy and jay. the two others are from a comic i like and their names are veloce and blackbird. in my head i'm dating blackbird and she's always there. we play videogames together and share our meals.  red truck that we gotta fix all the time. in real life i spend my days alone, laying in bed and playing videogames until i wonder what's wrong with me. when the thrill of the imaginary world fades away and i realize that i'll never have my friends. just a few months ago i stopped being in this ""world"" because i was happy. now i'm all alone again and they're all i have. i feel like a small child because of this, but it's the only thing that brings me comfort. if anyone else has a imaginary world, i'd love to hear about yours. edit: i'll try my best to respond to everyone &lt;3 i love hearing about your stories! it's reassuring to know that people can relate."
bipolar,ptsd,176,"i had ect and it changed my life i was hospitalized over a week ago for a suicide attempt. since i've been on around 30 different meds without much results, i requested etc (electro convulsive therapy) since they did it at the hospital i was in. i got three rounds of treatment and my depression has been zapped out of my brain. i feel so much better. just had to share. :)"
depression,anxiety,177,"do you ever picture yourself with someone and imagine all these scenarios and conversations u two could have? i do this all the time. if i'm crushing on someone, my mind will usually be filled with a bunch of sappy romantic plot lines, that will never happen in real life lol"
bipolar,depression,182,"it's my 31st birthday i didn't care to do anything this year. the only reason i bought a cake is because i have a six year old. the only reason i'm posting is because... those younger than me(wtf.) i am finally getting self discipline down and writing my books. i couldn't even imagine this all before. i've had the ups and downs but today, i am 31, and you'll get here one day, too."
bipolar,anxiety,189,"common cognitive distortions came across this and thought they may be useful for anyone suffering from mild depression: does anyone religiously do cbt and if so did it help? **common cognitive distortions** a partial list from robert l. leahy, stephen j. f. holland, and lata k. mcginn’s [*treatment plans and interventions for depression and anxiety disorders*] (2012) 1. **mind reading** you assume that you know what people think without having sufficient evidence of their thoughts. “he thinks i’m a loser.” 2. **fortune-telling** you predict the future negatively: things will get worse, or there is danger ahead. “i’ll fail that exam,” or “i won’t get the job.” 3. **catastrophizing** you believe that what has happened or will happen will be so awful and unbearable that you wothe way i feel now,” or “my parents caused all my problems.” 10. **what if?** you keep asking a series of questions about “what if” something happens, and you fail to be satisfied with any of the answers. “yeah, but what if i get anxious?,” or “what if i can’t catch my breath?” 11. **emotional reasoning** you let your feelings guide your interpretation of reality. “i feel depressed; therefore, my marriage is not working out.” 12. **inability to disconfirm** you reject any evidence or arguments that might contradict your negative thoughts. for example, when you have the thought i’m unlovable, you reject as irrelevant any evidence that people like you. consequently, your thought cannot be refuted. “that’s not the real issue. there are deeper problems. there are other factors.”"
ptsd,bipolar,192,no one will give me my meds i've seen three different doctors and none of them will give me my meds. i'm literally getting to the point i will just buy the pills off the internet and risk going to prison just to function. they keep trying to tell me there are other meds that help that aren't addictive. why do they keep telling me this fucking lie and why the fuck do they believe it!!! i guess i'll just drink to function because that's what these people fucking want. i want to strangle these fucking doctors.
ptsd,depression,193,"has any one found themselves isolated and lonely because they have trouble connecting to ppl? i only feel comfortable communicating with people who have some sort of serious mental health issue themselves as well, or are professionals in the field, thus very understanding. i am so tired of being lonely and limited in my abilities to make connections with people."
bipolar,depression,202,"i am so sick of the summits of false hope. you are climbing a mountain, it's hell, you want to give up , you push on and when you finally think you can't take another step, someone passes you on the way back down and tells you it's just 5 more minutes. a grueling ten minutes pass, you collapse on a rock and drop your pack. you see the summit. you lie on the ground for ten more minutes trying to shake out the last drops of water from the bottle into your mouth and they dribble down your face instead. you brought double the water everyoneg down, the view was beautiful, you should see the view from the peak, it's amazing, so worth the trip, and you go wtf. you know night will come eventually, climbing up that mountain, never reaching the ""summit"", uncertain of how many hours you have left. only that night will come and then the struggle will end. stop making false promises that ""it will get better"". stop asking me to believe in fairytales. i don't want another false hope only to be shattered again like a glass falling to hard floor. i am so tired of picking up the pieces."
adhd,bipolar,204,"friendly reminder to refill your meds. i took my last one today, and luckily i can get the prescription one more time from the apothecary(?) before i need to have a doctor's appointment. (just a regular check) i have 4 exams in 2 weeks. having to wait for a doctor's appointment would have been horrible. tldr just check how much you have left, and that you are good until the next refill :d"
bipolar,ptsd,207,"that left behind feeling? i've been feeling needy and ignored lately, the thing is i'm not interacting with anyone really outside my so. it's too much to handle right now. and my so gives me cuddles and is being helpful. there is really no one to ignore me, you know? but i just feel bad for some reason. i can't figure it out. i'm even upset when people don't reply or upvote my posts and that is really weird because i don't usually notice votes. i ruminate over whether i said the wrong thing or upset someone. i don't alwayen when i've gone into crisis i managed. i dunno, i felt a little weird after a session a few weeks ago. kinda like emdr weird and the session was kinda an unconscious exploring one, not emdr but a different therapy. i keep going back to that. i am left with just vague feelings i don't understand and just feeling uneasy. this is really bugging me. i keep expecting it to resolve, but when i'm resting or taking a time out to recharge it's really on my mind. and i feel unusually sensitive of late,since that weird appointment."

bipolar,adhd,771,"""1) nothing makes you happy/all you do is complain/2) everytime we talk, there's conflict, so i'm anxious whenever we speak/ 3) every time you talk, you complain."" i'm afraid of being this unhappy person who pushes people away. anyone hear else? 3 long stories; tldr at the bottom. so in the title, within quotation marks, are what i've heard from people i spent the most time with. 1) my mom, 2) a now-ex boyfriend, and 3) a former friend. 1) my mom kinda blew up in the parking lot of a hospital. the doctor said i didn't need a cough pill for my infection, and would be fine with only the prescription she gave me, and then my mom asked if she could prescribe me with a cough syrup. the doctor agreed to prescribe a strong cough syrup, and i asked if i don't need a cough pill, ""do i need cough syrup?"" the doctor said no, but said ""the medicines won't react with one another,"" and ""if you want a cough syrup, i can prescribe one."" *but i don't.* my cough won't go away (respitory infection) until the steroids kick in, but it will go away. i don't like taking meds i don't need. i'm defensive about this, because every time i have respitory issues, my mom asks the doc for a cough syrup ""for my own good"" and i feel like shit bc it's got some depressive drug in it, and i feel ultra sluggish the morning after i take it. i don't need it so i'm adverse to taking it. my mom says it's ridiculous that i have a cough and won't take a cough syrup, when no cough syrup was prescribed or suggested. the steroids will take it's course. but mothers will be mothers. i just hate taking drugs i don't actually need. (and i'm 18 so i'd think the doctor would have asked me first. guess not.) anyway she called me ungrateful and wouldn't let me speak and i dunno. it hit me. she said: ""i'm better off dead than i am alive to you, because nothing i do as your mother makes you happy."" i wanted to shoot myself in the mouth right there and then, ngl. i know that isn't the (logical) answer to this, but she isn't the only one who's said stuff like this. 2) my ldr boyfriend of two years broke up with me last night. he says he doesn't feel like he can talk to me, because he says offhanded things, and for a while, i didn't address them until months later (which is toxic). and now he feels that he'll fuck up no matter what he does, so what's the point. in the past i've addressed things as they came up and he either made fun of me, got super defensive, or asked ""so what's the problem?"". for example: he didn't speak to me for long periods of time. for like. a year. cancelled majority of skype dates at the last second. i said that i knew he has other obligations, but that still felt a bit emotionally neglected. (being left on read for days and sometimes weeks, not hearing from him for months, reading an ""i love you, too"" from him was rare. i felt like he didn't like me.) but he said that i had no reason to believe that. he had a roommate who made me cry, and he didn't defend me. even if i say that i didn't appreciate a comment, he would just join him. of course, he didn't mean to be rude, and of course he didn't mean to overlook my crying, didn't mean to misunderstand me. but he refused to buy earbuds because of his ""indispoable income"" (even if he went out to drink once a month). which gave his roommate ammo to be a bully. so i mailed my then-bf earbuds and he lost them. it felt as if he didn't put any effort into the relationship, and was justifying himself. when i asked if he wanted to break up, he sounded surprised and confused as to why. said that he loves me. i wasn't angry, just hurt and confused with all the mixed messages. but i said i believed him and ignored my gut. plus, on holidays, he drives six hundred miles in one go to visit me (and his family. so contrary to what he says, i'm not the only reason he comes to the city i live in.) but he said ""you think i wanna see my family? barely anyone there wants to see me. i'md avoiding me, too. avoiding everyone. got in a real bad funk. said uncalled for comments to me and to other people. i understand how depression can be; but that doesn't excuse her from being mean. from playing rough and with scissors (as a seventeen year old). from going out of her way to patronize people. but she put on her snapchat story her suicidal thoughts, talking about how everyone she knows is against her. so i swiped up, let her know that i apologize if i wronged her, and that i want her to be okay. that i don't think anyone is against her. that i am here if she needs to talk. she said that i can't make her pity me, and i was baffled. that she doesn't have the energy for my bullshit. (yikes.) that i shouldn't play nice if i don't feel nicely about a person. (still don't know what's she was talking about but it was childish. but still yikes.) and then she said all i do is complain about my family problems and boyfriend and do nothing to fix it. (that was when i said ""good to know,"" and blocked her. hehe.) it's so funny that she *asked me* what's wrong, didn't accept ""nothing"" for an answer, and then secretly hated when i was open and honest. i thought she was my friend. but i guess only therapists are meant to hear your problems. anyway. i digress. days after i blocked her, she came around me in person. went out of her way to sit next to me. acted fearful, as if i would reject her. took every single chance she got to be overly nice. for example: i was presenting and the class (of 13 people) was talking over me. she stood up, cupped both hands over her mouth, and projected: ""everyone! chris is talking! it is important to hear what they say, so that they can finish their presentation!"" sat down, then grinned at me. the class had the same weirded-out expression as i did. like. ugh. that was so artificial that it hurt me. i have a floridan friend who i tell some of these situations with, and he says it sounds like the other person has some unsolved problems of their own. my therapist said the same thing about all three scenarios. that nothing i complain about is like. ""i'm so sad my dad got me a blue car. i wanted a red one."" y'know? like the problems that bother me are literally ""so i'm homeless and don't know where i'm sleeping tonight "" or ""i got 27 spider bites in my sleep"" or ""my mom is threatening to kick me out and i'm an unemployed student"" or something that can't be given advice, because it's totally out of anyone's control. like when my car got totalled and i kept having flashbacks about the crash throughout the day. i couldn't sleep at night. for weeks. or when three of my classmates died. or when i was in a sexually abusive relationship for six months, got assaulted everyday on school grounds, and didn't tell anyone for eight months. i have flashbacks and awful dreams about *that* one to this day. but i don't say anything until someone asks me what's wrong. and even if they do, i'm reluctant to say so. bc none of this can be hugged better. it's heavy. it's uncomfortable and nobody wants to hear it. those are the only things that get to me. those are the things i go to therapy for. but my therapist doesn't believe in dwelling on (talking about) past traumas and griefs. i don't know what anyone wants me to do anymore. do i just let go of *everything*? i do not exagerrate; these things happened in the same twelve months. i'm not trying to excuse my complaints, but, yikes. i don't know what to make of any of this. anyway. tldr: nobody i open up to stick around. are all of these situations like. situations where both parties have made acceptable mistakes in handling their situation? or am i this unhappy person who makes people miserable because i complain so much? am i ungrateful? am i being crazy for saying the things i do? does anyone else hear statements like these from people who see you the most? it's times like these that makes self destructive behavior so easy."

anxiety,ptsd,1203,"wife had panic attack in the theater and passed out. my wife passed out from a panic attack yesterday in the theatre while we were watching *a quiet place*. i was so scared and didn't know what to do. about an hour into the movie, there's a scene where someone steps on a nail. it wasn't even very gory, but i guess it triggered some bad memories for her. a few seconds after that scene, my wife's arm started twitching kind of like a seizure. at the same time, she started making sounds like she was snoring or maybe choking. when i looked at her, her head was lolled to the side and her eyes were closed. not realizing what was happening, i nudged her a bit, thinking she had fallen asleep. when her head rolled to the other side and there wasn't any other response my concern sky-rocketed. i took her head in my hands and gently shook her a little bit trying to wake her up. her eyes partially opened, and i could see her pupils were looking up like when you roll your eyes. there was no other response. i tilted her head forward and the ""snoring"" sound stopped, but she was still unconscious. at this point,d her and help her feel safe. i tried to just hold her and comfort her. after about a half hour she was doing better. i felt so helpless when she was unconscious. it's very scary when you suddenly realize your loved one is having a medical emergency. later in the evening, she revealed to me that when she was a teenager, she had an abusive boyfriend that would rape her, cut her with a scalpel, and poke her with needles. sick stuff like that i guess. she wouldn't say much more about it than that. i am angry. not at her, but at the thought some sicko did this to her. and i hurt. i grieve that she has experienced something so traumatic it causes this type of thing. she agreed we will get her into some therapy. she needs healing that i never knew she needed. i also know this isn't about me, but i feel a bit hurt this is just now coming out. we've been married about 5 years, and i never knew this stuff. what else don't i know? i don't know what type of advice i'm looking for. how can i be there for her? how can i help? what do i do if this happens again? did i do the right thing both during and after?"

adhd,depression,1281,"what learned helplessness is like just in case anyone isn't aware of what learned helplessness feels like, and as a warning to people not to keep trying the same thing over and over, i've written the following. i will use the term ""brain"" to refer to the unconscious, impulsive parts of the brain, the parts that aren't ""you"", and ""you"" to refer to your conscious experience and rational brain. (disclaimer, this is only my experience, i don't know what other people's experiences are.) --- imagine walking around, going through life, except you don't decide what you do. your brain decides everything for you and you have no say. it wants to play video games, so you play video games. that isn't to say you don't fight it, but on those occasions that you do you either are simply unable to do anything, or every frustration with yourself for every past failure floods upon you, washing your willpower away in a tidal wave of anxiety. you quickly learn the only way to fight is to not fight at all. --- now, imagine somebody calmly tells you, ""i know it's hard, but you really need to just get up and do it. i have no magic bullet unfortunately."" this is nice, they know that you have a hard time ""just doing it"" but at this point there's no way around it, it just needs to be done. you wholeheartedly agree with them, and feel like the ultimate solution _is_ to ""just do it"". your brain however immediately reminds you how ""it's never worked before, so why will it work now?"" this isn't just a small voice, it is backed by the combined anxiety of every failure and inadequacy you have ever had. --- i'll attempt to explain what lies behind this sense of hopelessness: this sense of hopelessness, in its simplest form, is the feeling that ""it's never worked, so why would it change?"" however, it goes deeper than that. the following is the main thought process: - according to other people you just need to try hard enough to solve the problem - you feel ""i just don't care anymore"" ( ditto ) - ""i hate myself"" (when i metaphorically close my eyes, cover my ears, and run from what i need to do yelling ""lalalalalalalala"", also when i am sitting doing something i enjoy and remember what i'm supposed to be doing) - ""i just can't."" (when i try to calm myself or when i'm lying in a fetal position on the bed, spiraling deeper into depression) - ""i just want the world to go away"" (this feeling makes me realize why some people kill themselves. i fortunately just retreat to my bed or some form of entertainment that allows my brain to shut off temporarily) --- i'm not saying this is permanent problem, or that there aren't any solutions, just that it's incredibly difficult, more difficult than i feel most anyone can imagine. it's the torture of hopelessness, with the frustration of fully knowing with your rational brain that hope itself is all that is needed to solve the problem, yet finding that hope hopelessly far away. please, everyone. think before you tell someone to ""just try."" they may have forgotten how to. --- edit: some people may say that you just need to build in systems, and i agree that that is a good solution, but at least for me, i've tried so many of my own systems that even trying to talk with it causes my brain to lock up with anxiety. likely because it forces me to confront all my past failures, which further discourages me from trying. i'd still love to hear any advice people have though. --- tl;dr; learned helplessness isn't thinking you are helpless, it is feeling that you've forgotten how to try. if you really wanted to try it would have worked, since people say to just try, so you must not really _want_ to try, so you begin to instead want to want to try. in addition, confronting it in any way brings with it all the anxiety of every past failure, meaning that often, instead of doing something you often fail to do you just close your eyes and hope it'll go away."
depression,bipolar,1285,"do you ever flip into a ""good day"" where you feel happy and energized, then go to sleep and wake up feeling majorly depressed again? i took a number of ssris during my last depressive episode and wellbutrin xl was the only one that made me flip into ""good days"" on occasion, however, would often slip back into depre't done much but in 5 months, have only flipped into a ""good day"" twice where i feel normal, energized, have my motivation back and feel like my old self. i tried to get angry and vowed to wake up to being feeling good, but sadly, the next morning i was back to a deep depression. has anyone else had this experience?"
bipolar,adhd,1286,"i can really use some encouragement right now. my doctor recently decided that she thought i was stable enough to start treating my adhd on top of my bp1. she warned me that the medicine could cause me to have a bad reaction and potentially lead to another psychotic episode or something. she started me on a low dose of vyvance but i didn't feel like it was doing anything and i've gradually gone up to the maximum dose. i've been pretty messed up for about a week now though. i also have pretty bad social anxiety and i think the meds are making me manic or mixed manic. i've been very disconnected from other people., paranoid and socially withdrawn. i havnt left my appr but i'm afraid because i don't want to get admitted again. she's a new doctor and i don't know how she is about this sort of thing. my last dr seemed like he wanted to try and have me admitted ""for observation"" all the time, even when he wanted to try me on new medicine. that's bullshit though because hospitals are safe places where they remove the stress of the outside world. how can they observe if a medicine is working or not if there aren't any factors at play that would cause an episode. i don't know what to do. i won't go in for an unscheduled appointment. the last time i went to an unscheduled appointment for issues i ended up being admitted against my will"
