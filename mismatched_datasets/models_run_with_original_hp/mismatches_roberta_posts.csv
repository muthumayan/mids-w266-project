bipolar,anxiety,5,"i am in grad school. i have two assignments to do before the end of the month and i'm not gonna do them. one was due dec 15, last year! accessibility services helped me get an extension to april 30. i haven't done any work on it. the anxiety is so high about it i'm not going to get it done. and i can't work on the other one, because then i'm not working on that one. i've sought help from accessibility services at school. i met with a learni the water. how many times do i get to ask for help? its not fair. i'm taking resources from the people who ask for help and then actually make use of it. the cycle is just going to continue. depression, procrastinate, anxiety, depression, ask for extension, depression, procrastinate, anxiety, depression. i hate it. it doesn't stop. my thoughts keep arriving at the only way to make it all stop entirely. but i don't want that. i don't think."
anxiety,depression,6,"everything has become too much and my panic disorder and health problems are making it impossible for me to work. i'm so scared of telling my boss. i'm so sick to my st'm making lightly or without support or discussion, but it still doesnt make it any less difficult to give up my source of income, even if it's to improve my wellbeing."
depression,anxiety,9,"we've been dating the past month and i got the balls to ask her out. she said she'll think about it which means no, but i still got the nerve to do it! üòÉ"
ptsd,adhd,17,"this week has been god awful, but finding this sub and being able to relate / not feel so alone is really helpful and i‚Äôm really happy that this community exists."
bipolar,anxiety,20,"just wanted to share that i finally got myself together enough to book an appointment with the therapist. i kinda stopped going and kept putting it off (it's ok i'll go next month, etc.) three years later i find myself on the edge, i'm relieved to have made the call. wish me luck!"
bipolar,adhd,21,"my doctor recently decided that she thought i was stable enough to start treating my adhd on top of my bp1. she warned me that the medicine could cause me to have a bad reaction and potentially lead to another psychotic episode or something. she started me on a low dose of vyvance but i didn't feel like it was doing anything and i've gradually gone up to the maximum dose. i've been pretty messed up for about a week now though. i also have pretty bad social anxiety and i think the meds are making me manic or mixed manic. i've been very disconnected from other people., paranoid and socially withdrawn. i havnt left my appartment sense saturday. im havingid because i don't want to get admitted again. she's a new doctor and i don't know how she is about this sort of thing. my last dr seemed like he wanted to try and have me admitted ""for observation"" all the time, even when he wanted to try me on new medicine. that's bullshit though because hospitals are safe places where they remove the stress of the outside world. how can they observe if a medicine is working or not if there aren't any factors at play that would cause an episode. i don't know what to do. i won't go in for an unscheduled appointment. the last time i went to an unscheduled appointment for issues i ended up being admitted against my will"
ptsd,anxiety,26,"so long story short, recently i‚Äôve been noticing i have more stomach troubles. vomiting, diarrhea, etc. yesterday i had another ‚Äústomach bug‚Äù but i noticed as soona man had gotten too close to me and i almost threw up in my car on the way home. does anyone else experience this? is this something i should tell my psychiatrist?"
none,depression,29,"i am done with this shit. people are ugly bc. i decided to put some roti and sabzi next to this sleeping beggar on shivaji bridge station. didn't want to disturb his somber. this drunk uncle pats my back , goes ""bahund apologized to the beggar. one can't even be kind now. it broke my spirit man. i didn't want him to be kicked and beaten up like that. i feel horrible. this nation is going nowhere. maa chudao. i repeat maaa chudao."
bipolar,depression,39,i simply couldn‚Äôt handle the monotony and soul crushing nature of an office job for myself....and while that may be true of being a dishwasher it‚Äôs at least more mind numbing. i feel like i failed societal expectations and my family‚Äôs as well by ending up this way but it truly is the disease. this happen to anyone else? were you able to find contentment in simpler work?
anxiety,depression,55,"i don't really have any friends in school and therefore nobody wished me a happy birthday today, so i was wondering could anyone wish me a happy birthday here, it would be really appreciated! thanks."
anxiety,depression,77,"for the first time in at least a year, today i went out to do the grocery shopping, and i‚Äôm ducking proud about it! every sunday, my partner kindly goes to the st today, i grabbed the bags, and went, on my own, like a pro! i guess i just needed to express it, and give some hope to some of you! things get better with time!"
anxiety,bipolar,78,"for example, my parents are going away for a week later this year. i don't want to be at home alone, but i can't sleep out of my house, i haven't slept out in at least 10 years. i asked a friend if they would mind sleeping over and they were like ""sure! i'd be glad to"". i was like, what, they just agreed like that??? they're so cool with sleeping out???? what???? aren't they going to miss their bed? and pets? and family? so weird to me."
bipolar,anxiety,79,i've been struggling to rationalize myself right now. i have thoughts to hurt or kill myself. or walk for hundreds of miles. that my family and friends hate me that to fail.fail.fail.fail.fail. i don't know how to control this my speech is being affected by this either too fast or slow and slurred. this anxiety has to stop now.
anxiety,depression,81,"for a while now i've had fairly severe anxiety surrounding death -- i can't come to terms with the fact that i will die. it overwhelms me and scares me and i don't kms so pointless. i've dealt with depression in the past, but in some senses this almost seems worse... i'm trying to find a therapist, but it's harder than i thought."
adhd,bipolar,85,today i almost feel like... manic? i don't want to minimize what it's like to have an actual manic episode but goodness gracious my mind is racing. and i cannot focus on anything and feel like need to do something crazy. (more than i usually do hahaha)
ptsd,depression,92,"i'm 26 now and 8 months ago my (first ever) girlfriend of a year killed herself, i was the first to find her. i've moved to a different state and tried to keep busy, but time isn'to go to class but i'm planning to just drop them all. i'm a former marine and spent time in iraq and afghanistan, but that's nothing compared to losing my baby the way i lost her."
anxiety,none,97,"hi guys, so yesterday i (23f) had my graduation and i asked my family to be there. i wanted to share this moment, but nothing big. i wanted to go to lunch with them,my food) it wasnt my day. but my sister (43) told me ( as everybody else tells me) 'dont whine. they mean well and suck it up' *tl;dr: is it sellfish?! is it really?*"
anxiety,ptsd,106,"depersonalization/dissociating is the closest thing i've found to how i feel but not quite. i feel like i'm just floating through my days. like they fade into each other and i'm just trying to get through each one to make it into the next. i feel so like i can relate to anyone either, so i don't bother going out of my way to communicate with anyone (say in a class setting) which just adds to the not-present feeling. what is this called, if anything? and what can i do about it? i'm so miserable"
none,ptsd,114,"i was recording the police while they were using same mouthpiece to check for *drinking under influence* during march. i felt that this is wrong to do while there is a contagious virus out there, you fucking don't know who's got it. one traffic cop sneaked up to me and held me while he called all his colleagues, 7-8 guys surrounding me. their leader screamed and yelled at much law exists and people know about it, it will make a significant difference because the police will have a sense of ""someone's watching me"" and could bring down police brutality. edit: deleted the video, it made me feel uncomfortable having it in my gallery. i had nightmares about how it could have gone more wrong, for a week. you know it's bad when police gives you ptsd."
bipolar,anxiety,124,the school year is finally starting! i've been going in on extra days to decorate my classroom. it's pretty much decorated and now i'm organizing my cabinets since they're a mess with random stuff shoved places. i think by the start of the year i'll have stuff totally organized. i'm so so so excited! it gives me a sense of worse. i'm sure the kids will stress me out when they come and i'll get all anxious but for now i'm having a great time.
ptsd,anxiety,129,"like it says, something feels wrong. i can taste in my mouth that something isn't right. it's as if i'm looking at everything through a different light, like my mind is seperate  screamed throughout my head. i can feel in my chest that something is wrong, it's not anxiety, it's my heart pumping so loud. it feels like something very bad is about to happen."
ptsd,bipolar,130,"i (26f) don‚Äôt want to go into a lot of detail because i‚Äôm still processing everything. i had a psychotic break last week after a huge trigger. last wednesday i drove up to a cabin in the woods and swallowed a bunch of pills until the cops showed up, called by my parents after they tracked me down. they took me to the nearest hospital where i actually escaped then was brought back again by the police out looking for me. i‚Äôve literally lost count of how many attempts i‚Äôve made, but i know it‚Äôs in the 20 range. most of them occurred in a 3 month periodanything similar? how did you cope? maybe if i just hide in bed the rest of my life i‚Äôll live to be 80. she said i can do it, but i need to realize the harsh truth of the matter that i have already beat the odds too many times. i feel unfixable. will i be broken forever? will i live until i‚Äôm 80? i really hope so, but now i‚Äôm not so sure. attempting suicide became a coping mechanism for me years ago but i thought after a year and a half of therapy i could go the rest of my life without an attempt. i don‚Äôt know what i‚Äôm looking for, any help i guess."
adhd,depression,137,"volunteer at a nature park. i did that once for school before depression made it hard to go to school. it was great, made me feel productive, helped me socialize, and made me happy. it is something i can do, believe in, and will be make me happy. :)"
anxiety,adhd,145,"i have this weird situation going on where nearly every morning now, after waking up around 3-4 a.m. i will be half-awake and trying to go back asleep, the problem is, that my mind is constantly telling me, your alarm is about to go off, yorning. i was dreaming that i woke up and checked my phone and a girl replied, so was replaying a scenario of what i was gonna text back, over, and over, and over again. i finally realized that it wasn't actually happening and woke myself up."
depression,bipolar,148,"i was putting dishes in the sink this morning so i could wash them before going to work. my phone goes off in my pocket. it's my mom. my heart drops. my grandma's health has been declining for the last year and we've had a few scares where she's close to death. so, naturally i think that my grandma had passed. no, it was the sheriff. my heart drops even farther now. oh god, who is it? he says eric lastname had passed away this morning. he went for a walk and someone found him dead. at this time, i'm just in shock thinking this is some fucked up dream. eric has been my step father for the last 21 years. we butted heads from the start, but he kept me straight and pushed me to do better. i would hate to see where i would be if it weren't for eric being in my life. i could only imagine that i would be living on the streets, or dead. eric and i have receeal getting there. i'm about to head out in a few minutes to go see her. this is the worst thing that could happen now. eric was taking care of finances for my grandma since she's in hospice and their own finances. so now she'll have to take care of her house and land, plus my grandma's land. we don't expect grammy to live for another 6 months or so. so, that gives us a bit of time to think, but i know my mom is going to be devastated for quite some time. i'm ok at the moment, but i know i'm going to be pretty fucked up about this for a long time. i love that man as a father. he was someone i could look up to. someone who would give you the shirt off of his back, or meet me half way between cities to give me money we desperately needed. i miss that man. i may need to call my doctor to get my antidepressants upped. i don't deal with death well at all."
ptsd,bipolar,152,"i grew up in the woods with an older brother who is a diagnosed psychopath. physical violence was a problem from the time i was 2 until i was 14. i don't mean normal brother stuff. it was sadistic. i don't remember a lot of it but my parents tell me he would beat me when i was still in my crib, so they had to keep us apart. he broke my ribs a few times jumping on me and cracked my skull twice. i always knew things were dangerous if i sensed he was bored and there was no one around. there was also sexual abuse from age 10 to 12. anyway, i live in a busy city now and i sleep just fine with car noises, sirens, peoples voices just outside, but if a doorknob turns i am instantly awake. he used to sneak in my room and choke me aing practical, realistic, and cautious. it's the city, i was raised in the woods where there is no crime because there's no people, certainly home invasions were not a thing that ever happened there but they happen in cities, right? and in some way i think i'm right but maybe she has a point, especially about the doorknob thing. the only reason he ended up ultimately leaving me alone was we got in a fight and i managed to put myself in a position where i could have murdered him and convinced him quite rightly that with what was documented about him no jury would convict me. i will never forget how his face changed when he realized i was serious. and it wouldn't have worked unless i really was. soooo am i screwed up or....?"
depression,ptsd,153,"it's terrible feeling. i want to cry, just let it out, but i can't. it feels like my soul is crying, but i just physically can't get it out. it's like i'm stuck with this pain forever and am not allowed to at least alleviate it in a way. i... just can't explain it... i just hope someone understands..."
ptsd,bipolar,155,"for me, i have bought many books and i have spent lots of money on insurance, doctors visits, and medication. a significant area that i haven't invested in is therapy. instead, i have always sought out free therapy which may or may not be effective. so, what about you? what areas have you invested in?"
adhd,bipolar,159,"hey everyone, can we talk about a serious topic for a moment? i want to hear the community's experience on masturbation and medication. **is anybody else experiencing porn addiction or extremely long fap sessions that are hard to stop early?** --- my story: i've always had some elements of porn &amp; masturbation addiction but it never got out of hand (pun intended) nor did it ever affect my life. i wouldn't have  way to overcome it or mitigate it, but failed. this week i've started nofap since my own personal measures didn't work. if i can't fix it myself by the next time i see my psych, it's too serious for me not to tell him about all this. --- **am i the only one that experiences this? do you guys have any similar experiences?** thank you for your thoughts or anything at all. i just ask that you keep it serious. thanks."
bipolar,anxiety,167,"i‚Äôm in a good place in my life right now, and i finally found a good balance of medicine and therapy, etc. but i keep getting paranoid that people around me are going to wake up one day and dislike me or want to hurt me. i know that logically, mooughts or feelings, i‚Äôve convinced myself that everyone has trouble with that. and that someday, they‚Äôll all leave in the same way that i walked out of people‚Äôs lives in the past. it makes it really hard to form meaningful relationships sometimes."
bipolar,depression,169,just like the title says lose shit and can‚Äôt remember shit most of the time just going to motions super hyper to super depressed n seconds don‚Äôt know how to talk to nobody can‚Äôt express emotions cuz it‚Äôs a billion of them hate everyone cry randomly always tired stupid tic from pass meds multiple personalities nobody understands or take the time to understand wat a great fucking life i live :/
anxiety,bipolar,177,"j. cole is in denver and i couldn't find anyone to go with. i fucking love j cole and i'm sick of relying on other ppl to do and see the shit i want. so fuck it, i bought a ticket and am going solo. i know my anxiety and self awareness will come up but i think once the show starts i'll be too indulged to care. wish me luck :p"
bipolar,depression,184,"i live in south texas. the weather here is always humid and hot as balls, however we are finally beginning to see some weather changes. it was pouring almost all day yesterday and this morning when i walked out of my apartment to leave for work, it was fresh! fresh and cloudy and so beautiful, but then i started to feel the depression creeping in. for fuck's sake *eyerolls so fucking hard*"
depression,anxiety,189,"i wish i knew who to talk to, if i had anyone to talk to at all. a lot of the time, i'm too anxious to know what to do, and too worried to share my opinion or talk in public. i've gotten more irritable, and i hate it. at the same time, i wish i knew what i could do. how do you even make friends anymore? what do you do after you meet people?"
depression,anxiety,192,"you want certian people to always be there for you but they just can't be. they're busy and have their own lives. or maybe they just don't understand how much you're going througlly maybe showed concern for my well being. i just want to spend time with someone my age who actually also wants to hangout with me, and not just me wanting to hangout with them."
anxiety,adhd,205,"i'm having a really weird time right now. i'm going to preface this by saying i make significantly more than a lot of people, but i'm just learning to be responsible with it as of recently. in trying to save towat the thought of my dreams and aspirations would take someone else an hour to achieve. just... yeah. sorry to rant. i'm down tonight. going to apply for a few more part time jobs. i hate being impatient like this."
depression,anxiety,207,anytime i go to a party or an event i just feel worse afterwards. every part of me just feels completely worse after the event. am i just going crazy or does this happen to others?
ptsd,bipolar,208,i really need some support i‚Äôm feeling over the edge semi suicidal because i feel like i‚Äôm failing at everything. i can‚Äôt even make friends. maybe i am just a bad person. maybe everything my ex ever said was true. i just feel like such a failure and just have no enthusiasm to keep fighting. need some encouragement. i have no one.
bipolar,anxiety,213,"someone, seriously help me out here. i've masturbated 3 separate times today, two of which have been in the last hour, i've cum probably at least a dozen time, and i can not get any relief. within 20 minutes of finishing i have that feeling again and its so strain i cant concentrate to to my work. please, any tips for relief are so welcome."
bipolar,ptsd,231,"i want recognition. i want people to see me as someone that needs help, not someone that's fine dealing with what happens. i'm almost debating oding for attention. i've never had this before. i don't know why. but my god do i want attention. last week i had others telling me not to go inpatient when i honestly needed it. now i'm not bad enough to go. i don't know how to get over this phase. i don't know how to get past the need for validation. what the fuck is wrong with me."
bipolar,anxiety,236,she's still an infant and i'm already worried that she knows that mommy is going through the motions some days. i try to keep doing our regular activities but it is so hard to smile and look and act enthusiastic. i'm just so tired and sad and i'm not sure i'm giving her what she needs. i'd love to hear your advice and experiences.
bipolar,adhd,238,i promised a friend i'd make a poster and a pin the tail on the donkey game for his kid's birthday. then i forgot - because my own kid had a school project that i threw all my free time this week into. i remembered thursday at work abofeel stupid for this. i also had a twelve hour work day yesterday and it's a job that requires tons of running. i hope they're happy with it all. if they're not... i guess i'll just have to accept that and know that i gave it my best!!!
ptsd,anxiety,239,"i would like to know if you might have some advice for this. i've never talked about what happened whit him but he knows that there is something wrorng because i often panick with him. he has a lot of respect for my silence but i really feel the need to talk. i've never done this and even if i want to do it, when he ask me if i want to explain him what happened i just say that i don't know what to say. how do you open up to someone? are there some things that make it easier?"
adhd,bipolar,244,"my dog likes to sit on the mat i keep by my back door, so i brought it with me to his obedience class last night. i remember putting the mat back in my bag ae car, and i have no freaking clue where the doormat went. i have lost many things. i have never before lost a doormat. tl/dr: who the fuck loses a doormat?!?"
adhd,anxiety,260,"i just came to complain honestly. i‚Äôve been trying to fall asleep for hours and i have to be up early and the fact that i have to wake up tomorrow morning stresses me out and then it makes it harder for me to sleep. i get so frustrated that people can just ‚Äúgo to sleep.‚Äù every time i put my phone away and close my eyes my mind just races with thoughts. sometimes anxious thoguhts, hypothetical scenarios, replaying conversations,  not even think it‚Äôs a panic attack, i can really only just describe it as just ‚Äúone of those nights‚Äù and it‚Äôs torture. not to mention i‚Äôve had like 2 different songs mentally playing while i‚Äôve tried to write this and lost track of myself while writing this post about three times. anyways thanks for reading if u made it to the end. it‚Äôs just comforting knowing that i‚Äôm not the only one bc it genuinely feels like i‚Äôm going crazy."
ptsd,bipolar,279,"i have this regularly and destroyed my social life once again a while back. i pushed away all people i love and lost basically every human connection. i feel like i'd just justify my behavio me. i don't think it's ever going to be any other way, so i don't care anymore. i'm starting to think that i should stay in this totally emotionless state just to stop hurting my loved ones."
adhd,none,280,"from an article i just read: &amp;#x200b; *the chaotic, ephemeral eddies under his grandfather's rowboat are a perfect image of nelson's style of thought. i was already taping our conversation, but nelson clearly wanted his own record. not because he was concerned about being quoted correctly, but because his tape recorder and video camera are weapons in an unending battle against amnesia. the inventor suffers from an extreme case of attention deficit disorder, a recently named psychological syndrome whose symptoms include unusual sensitivity to interruption.* *if he is stopped in the middle of anything, he forgets it instantly. only by running his own tape recorder could nelson be confident that his words would not float off, irrecoverably, into the atmosphere.* *nand a filmmaker, but he needed a way to avoid getting lost in the frantic multiplication of associations his brain produced. his great inspiration was to imagine a computer program that could keep track of all the divergent paths of his thinking and writing. to this concept of branching, nonlinear writing, nelson gave the name* *although the concept of hypertext made nelson legendary in programming circles, he is not a programmer. ""i have a terrific math problem,"" nelson said. ""i still can't add up a checkbook: i can add a column of figures five times, get four different answers, and none of them will be right. i'm very accident-prone and extremely impatient. i can't work my macintosh - i have three that are completely unfunctional and one is marginally functional.""*"
anxiety,none,282,"""the evening is a time to be calm,"" they said. ""monday is the worst part of the week."" i have never related to either of these statements for as long as i can remember. for as long as i can remember, in fay have created this earth, be it humanoid or not, leaves us every sunday night between 6:00pm and the end of my waking hours. i fear that my brain is too small to comprehend the reasons for their foul play."
anxiety,bipolar,285,"so i managed to do my first proper run just now, and my mind feels so clear i almost can't believe it. just wanted to share! stay strong you guys! &lt;3"
depression,anxiety,286,i find that through it all the worst part is just being so tired all the time. like sure sometimes i‚Äôm in a lot of pain but basic tasks are always hard and i just want to be in bed. anyone else and any advice?
adhd,anxiety,287,finally decided to take the plunge. i'm in the office waiting to get tested and i couldn't be more nervous. thanks for all the support guys. today i take control of my life.
anxiety,depression,292,"i constantly feel like i‚Äôm being lied to. i overanalyze things, my brain always finds a way to twisted things people say so it seems like a lie. my head hurts and i often cry. things started to feel like this since i was being cheated on 6 years ago."
bipolar,ptsd,298,"i have lied to my friends and family for a very long time. it goes beyond the ""how are you?"" and ""fine, thank you"" dialogue. i lived with a smile on my face and i told myself that i was strong. i recently had an episode where i couldn't fake it anymore. i became really really sick. and now, the people i love are asking me questions because theyd never hurt her like that. my mom looked so shocked. i want to keep lying and putting up a face. but the truth is that i'm exhausted and really tired of acting like someone i'm not. and i know that my family and friends are asking questions because they want to understand and help me, but i want them to continue seeing me as ""smiley joojoobar."""
adhd,none,299,"i think - hard to count exactly - that last year i wrote seven published papers, a letter in a journal, a book chapter, two national guidelines and some policies. one or two might get peer rejected. whatevs. mike drop."
ptsd,depression,306,i understand that it says more about them but i can‚Äôt help but feeling pain whenever i see yet another person that shows deliberate apathy towards me. everyone in my family and everyone i thought was my friend have been narcissistic. incapable of empathy.
bipolar,depression,316,"i have no motivation to do anything. i don‚Äôt go to my one online class, i don‚Äôt get off of my couch except for when my dog needs me to, i can‚Äôt clean, i can‚Äôt do the laundry, my dishes are piling up, and i still can‚Äôt make myself get off of this couch. how do y‚Äôall push through? what are little things you do to get out of this?"
depression,bipolar,317,"now that i've struggles with this bullshit for 7 years, i've come to the realisation that literally no one cares no one is genuinely there for you. everyone will claim to be there for you and beg you to open up to them because they want to be the hero who 'saves'd because you just can't quite bring yourself to talk to people. going through days of mania followed by weeks of lowness and having people expect you to be okay because of those few days of mania everyone wants to be there for you until you actually show symptoms"
depression,ptsd,320,this is becoming a problem. this is not the first time this has happened either. i am surprised i have not been fired. i just can't get up. i am so unmotivated. help! what can i do?
anxiety,depression,324,"i feel like i've become a shit ton better as a person, but there are those nights that make me relive all those bad moments and i beat myself up so much that i get seriously messed up. what i wouldn't give to go back and do it all over the right way again..that way, i might've made better friends who would've lasted through maybe? or maybe these experiences, they've made me better as a person? they've shaped me? i dont know at this point."
bipolar,adhd,328,"someone reminded me the other day that there‚Äôs no cure for this disorder. as someone with a family history of it and someone who has been struggling with it most of my life, i objectively knew that, but i realized that this whole time i‚Äôve been trying to change my medicine for almost a year, my mind has been hopeful for a cure. i have been wanting to cure it, not treat it, but actually be rid of it forever. wow. remembering that there‚Äôs no cure really hurts a lot and makes me kinda hopeless."
depression,ptsd,344,anyone else sick of other people ? i feel like nobody gets me and for some reason i attract drama and i sometimes believe it‚Äôs due to jealousy from other people. every time i come out of my shell and be myself i always seem to attract bad people and i don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because i‚Äôm highly empathetic and people sense it. urgh i‚Äôm just gonna revert back to being quiet and to myself. honestly
bipolar,adhd,345,"hi everyone! we just want to take a moment to celebrate hitting 20,000 subscribers!!! it has been great being part of such an amazing community. i know that this sub has helped a lot of us here. feel free to comment on what you really like about this sub or how this sub has helped you."
anxiety,bipolar,352,"i don't know how it happened. i was terrified in the interview and so incredibly awkward, but they offered me the job! woo. i haven't worked in 2 years having had a breakdown and 5 months off sick in my last job. i've made so much progress but finding a job to get backg in mental health they *should* be understanding about it if it does flair up. i hope. sorry if i'm showing off, i'm just so relieved the job search is over. i don't post often in here but i know it's nice to see some good news in this sub sometimes. things can change!"
ptsd,bipolar,353,"not all that unusual where i work actually. the supervisor i broke down in front of had his own breakdown about 8 years ago. its an engineering company that specializes in large, high risk sort of projects. so lots of crazy hours and stress. without realizing it, i went something like a week without sleep. i was supposeannot be on most meds), and various other things. nope....i get a couple of emails detailing the online videos i have to watch. ""sexual harassment: always a bad touch"", ""work place violence: serpentine to success"", ""msds and you"", along with ""export proprietary controls for intellectual property"" our hr department sucks."
bipolar,adhd,354,"i didn't care to do anything this year. the only reason i bought a cake is because i have a six year old. the only reason i'm posting is because... those younger than me: you'll be 31 i am finally getting self discipline down and writing my books. i couldn't even imagine this all before. i've had the ups and downs but today, i am 31, and you'll get here one day, too."

anxiety,depression,380,"my doctor and counselor have me listed as extreme anxiety and depression, early childhood ptsd, bi polar, borderline personality disorder. it's a relief to have an answer to what my problems are. this has been an on going problem my whole adult life. my first job, i had reasons for being depressed. i dropped out of school, parents were divorcing and i didn't have a stable housing situation, i was falling behind and depressed, full of anger and anxiety. i didn't want to call myself weak though and admit i had a problem, so i attempted to self medicate by escaping reality. i skateboarded, played video games, drank, smoked weed, partied, did everything i could to feel numb. 5 years later, because i didn't seek help or medication early on, i was put on suicide watch due to my new medications not worki application. my point to all this is i would be homeless and probably dead without her. she has saved my ass countless times over the years,having a mental illness makes holding a job so fucking difficult, i've lost at least 6 jobs since being with her. i have nothing but respect and love for her to be putting up with all this, while we are both still fairly young (i'm 24, she's 21 later this year) i wish her parents understood mental illness, but it's kind of a taboo in her family so we keep things as vague as possible. i just hope that i get through to disability services and can make an income that way, to relieve some stress from her life. she put off school for me from the very beginning, the least i can do is help her get through school. sorry about the rant. i hope everyone has a great day."

bipolar,anxiety,485,"so i have known for a long time i have suffered from depression and anxiety. i mean if you check my posts history you can see that. i find myself frequently depressed, to the point of wanting to just end things (however won't for a myriad of reasons). i also find myself anxious beyond belief about certain things. i was told for years that i had both depression and anxiety. nothing more, nothing less. i have had manic episodes, and when i am on go, i am on go, but i am good at looking stoic and being ""normal"" on the outside. if that makes sense? howevee down and given me exams or anything but has suggested it for years. my therapist even was on the boarder about it for a while. i am sure my mom has it too, albeit far more showing? so yeah, here we are! rather here i am in my early 30s and finally things click. however, it is scary. like i don't know what comes next? will this diagnosis impact my life negatively and adversely? will i have to disclose it, or hide it from my job? i don't know. it is ironically depressing in of it self. but we shall see what the future holds. anyway, thanks for reading!"

anxiety,ptsd,591,"i‚Äôve had the worst week of my life. pretty much lost the will to live. my anxiety has been at a all time high since i calmed it down a while ago. as seen via my last post i got sexually assaulted nearly 7 days ago and i‚Äôve been going off the rails ever since. i‚Äôve barely been sober and have been promiscuous which i‚Äôve never been before and i have no idea why after my assault all i want it for boys to respect me and say the right things before any sexual activity occurs. i had a boy say to me he wanted to get to know me before we had sex even though it was a one night stand and if it wasn‚Äôt for that nothing would of happened between us. it gave me at the time some false sense of security knowing i‚Äôm worth something and i‚Äôm not actually just a disposable machine that‚Äôs only good for one thing and that‚Äôs it? i went out last night and i‚Äôll spare the details as about 5 dknow a few of them don‚Äôt like me that‚Äôs evident and i‚Äôm not sure why because i‚Äôve not personally met any of them that don‚Äôt seem to like me, a lot of it has to be because of the guy i used to see and another guy i used to see who was also there. there was also drama as on friday someone slyly took a picture of me with a boy who had his arm around me who has a girlfriend (which i didn‚Äôt know) so everyone knows it‚Äôs me but they‚Äôre only not saying anything because the boy would fight all of them and probably win and his girlfriend showed up and punched him in the face and said he cheated on her, so i was quite a big topic of conversation in that apartment clearly and it‚Äôs giving me such bad anxiety i‚Äôm just worrying what people think of me and what was said about me i just don‚Äôt know what to do... i feel like i need to redeem myself but yet i‚Äôve just done nothing wrong?"

ptsd,anxiety,695,"i find it hypocritical that i am sometimes called a crazy person or a freak when i tell others that i suffer from a mental disorder, while in fact, the entire world is like a planet sized mental institution with various levels of crazy. it's just that ... some forms of craziness are more acceptable than others i find it funny that the enitre world is full of crazy, and then people who are reading this os posting on this tread for help and compassion becuase we unfortunately have to through some pretty harsh and intense mental battles ... they have the luxury to call **us** crazy **edit** ... i'm sorry ... maybe crazy is too much of a strong word. maybe weird is better - we have plenty of academic fields which have their own levels of weirdness *(some of them are truly more weird than others with abstract theories and assumptions that some people still beleive like left-handed people are criminals or pathological people)* - on this year, we were shown what extreme measures some world leaders are willing to do to get what they want. discrimion - we are now, in some way, slaves of social media. wanting to post plenty, sometimes even, unnecessary posts to please others because we don't want to feel alone or rejected or even ostracized by others becuase of how the internet often involves a lot of clickbait and using it for drama or even discriminating or humiliating others becuase we simply can and then, when someone knows that i have to go through a variety of mental battles which have affected by a number of factors, could be social like my past experiences or could be biological like genetics or could be internal like a part of personality that making me act in neurotic ways ... .... but still ... i am the one who is treated as this so-called **""freak""** and probably the same treatment for many other people around the world. *(i'm sorry if this hurt you. i just wanted to get this out of my chest)* *(also, sorry if there are my grammatical errors ... i have no idea why but my mental disorders affects my language skills. i don't know why or how but it annoys me and i apologise)*"

anxiety,ptsd,701,"the feeling can get pretty intense. i can think of several ways to describe it. dazed, foggy, stoned, out of it, etc but it's almost like that feeling you get if you cross your eyes (but not as intense). i've been going through a lot lately and my anxiety has it the roof."
bipolar,adhd,709,"i do at times. sometimes i will say ""the splu biders"" or ""tub bath"". reading is fine and easy, not dyslexic at all but the speech is weird. today i forget to take my meds, and found it to be worse than normal (with meds). anyone else experience this?"
adhd,depression,710,"i get really excited about an idea or something and im motivated about it . when it comes time to apply to it (job, student org), i get depressed and don't do well. then afterwards i regret. i keep getting rejected from everything. i'm really fucking upset and the people around me are really fucking tired of hearing me cry all the time. anyone else feel this way"
bipolar,anxiety,718,i got a cat almost a month ago. i got him because cats have been shown to help with anxiety. his favorite thing to do was to lay on my chest and purr while knocking my phone out of my hand to have me pet him. i lookedour ago. i don't understand how life has given me this many hardships in my life and especially 2 days before my birthday. all i wanted to do was spend it with him. i really do not know what to do. i'm just really sad.
bipolar,adhd,731,"i‚Äôm trying to stay awake to go get my boyfriend from the airport. after i realized he was going to get in waaaay later than my bedtime of 9:30, and lamented about this with my aunt. she and i concocted a plan: i‚Äôd to drive over to her house, and then she‚Äôd give me a ride to the airport to pick up boyfriend, and then he cout about my early bedtime, i‚Äôm happy that my meds are working along with my habits. it feels nice to realize that my meds are working and now i can do a bunch of work in therapy, along with petting my cats and stuff. boy, i am tired. i hope this isn‚Äôt coming off as braggy, but it felt nice to realize that this is happening."
anxiety,ptsd,732,"i was sitting at the doctors waiting for my husband to finish when the 700 club came on the tv talking about how jesus healed mental and physical disabilities. i thought about just going to the cnews. so i changed it to local news. so now listening to a million commercials, but none of them claiming i can be cured by allowing jesus into my heart. but i did it!! i'm really proud of myself."

anxiety,adhd,749,"i can't sit still when i get my eyebrows done, and when i'm in class i usually doodle to focus. i pay attention very well in school regardless of that, and drawing helps me focus."
anxiety,depression,759,"so the title sums it up. i'm almost 28, all my friends are engaged, married or have a clatter of children. i have never even had a boyfriend in my life. i've had ""friend with benefits"" who in reality were not friends and have not benefitted me. i can see now i was used a practice girl before they moved onto women they actually care about. i have social anxiety and hate myself so expect others to hate me too. things like eye contact are very difficult. i use alcohol as a tool to try and be fun but it never really works out. not e first time in my life, he dumped me before i got that far. i'm not angry, i don't blame him, he just didn't feel the same way i do. it's left me absolutely broken. i believe im not good enough for anyone and don't see the point in going on anymore. i just go through the motions every day without feeling anything. i am on meds and see a doctor regularly but nothing helps. i tried counselling and could not talk. i have a history involving suicide and sexual assault and so trust is hard for me. i don't know where to go from here."
anxiety,depression,761,"tomorrow i bury my best friend who tragically passed away at the age of 25. i'm heartbroken and i will be speaking at his funeral. i am happy with the speech but i am nervous, petrified to mess up. he was an incredible guy and i want to send him off well, justify what he meant to me. my ex who broke up with me 2 months ago has kept contact to ask how i have been doing and if i ever needed anything go to her. i went to the gym yesterday evening just to pass the time and maybe work off a small hangover i was nursing from the night before. i felt okay but by the end of my session i was very tired. as i was walking back towards my flat i spot my ex with a guy next to her sitting down. i could have turned around but i didn't. i go up to her and say hi, she seems shocked to see me and asks if i'm doing okay. i say no, not really and say i'll leave them to it and say goodbye. as i walk down the road my ex has caught up with me after she runs to catch up with me. she says she has done this to tell me thatuy who has a family that makes her laugh, feel alive. this guy has a child. i recognise him from her xmas party. i'm really confused about why she chased after me. it's obvious she cares but is she feeling guilty, trying to spare my feelings in the hardest time of my life. i do want her back in my life but seeing her with another guy hurt big time. seeing them close to each other eating ice cream. she works with him, did she like him when we were dating. i also hate the idea of her sharing her sympathy and support with other people, especially a guy like that. and it hurts to hear her say to me he's going through a hard time. i'm going through the hardest time of my life. i feel like i can't use her as a crutch. i'm so confused, hurt, a mess. i bury my best friend tomorrow . i am absolutely terrified. i feel sick, like i'm going to mess up and ruin everything. the last 2 months has been the worst of my life, it just has. i want things to be better. i want him back. i want her back. i feel terrible."
depression,ptsd,765,i've been dealing with this long enough that i'm fairly certain things aren't going to get better. medication doesn't work. talk therapy doesn't work. hitting the gym doesn't work. getting degrees in psychology doesn't work. consulting expertn't really that helpful here. i just wanted to get the thoughts out of my head and articulate them to someone other than myself. please don't tell me to call a hotline and listen to some underpaid stranger try to convince me that i'm mistaken.
bipolar,depression,770,"you are climbing a mountain, it's hell, you want to give up , you push on and when you finally think you can't take another step, someone passes you on the way back down and tells you it's just 5 more minutes. a grueling ten minutes pass, you collapse on a rock and drop your pack. you see the summit. you lie on the ground for ten more minutes trying to shake out the last drops of water from the bottle into your mouth and they dribble down your face instead. you brought double the water everyone else did and it wasn't enoughiew was beautiful, you should see the view from the peak, it's amazing, so worth the trip, and you go wtf. you know night will come eventually, climbing up that mountain, never reaching the ""summit"", uncertain of how many hours you have left. only that night will come and then the struggle will end. stop making false promises that ""it will get better"". stop asking me to believe in fairytales. i don't want another false hope only to be shattered again like a glass falling to hard floor. i am so tired of picking up the pieces."

anxiety,depression,779,"oh hey, you again. i thought i would be alone today since yesterday i slept a lot, ate healthy and exerciced; but yet here you are. waking up with you is not exactly what i wanted (nor expected), but i guess there is nothing i can do. today you are like my shade again, following me everywhere i go. it does not really matter what i do since you will probably stay with me at least for the rest you deteriorate a bit more my identity, thanks to you i am completely lost. but not today. because even if you want to, today you will not have the energy to stop me, today it is me who controls you. i know i cannot fight you, but i want you to try and exhaust you until you vanish. because this is what you deserve. so good luck with that, i really want to see you try. best regards, your owner."
adhd,ptsd,787,i have an issue with balance. i never know when i'm on the path to burnout until i get there because i don't know how to differentiate between pushing through for discipline or pushing myself past my limits. does that make sense? does anyone have advice?
depression,anxiety,791,i feel like shit mentally and physically and i'm terrified :( and all at the time when i have received horrible news.. edit: thank you everybody who has commented and whoever else might want to share their experience. every single one of you has alleviated my depressive thoughts and anxiety. thank you. i hope this post has done the same for some of you aswell.
anxiety,depression,798,"i mean, it‚Äôs pretty catch-all, hitting every note from personal catastrophic failure to an impending apocalypse. ‚Äúwell, it‚Äôd suck real bad if [blank] happened, but there‚Äôs always a rock to smash your own head in with!‚Äù"
anxiety,depression,800,"i think about this a little more than i should... and then i keep saying ‚Äúyou have nothing wrong with you! your parents were right, you‚Äôre just faking it for the attention! and then think about that until you cry? bothers me."
anxiety,adhd,811,"a stigma that i‚Äôve noticed in the mental health community... so many people are happy to talk about it and embrace your differences, but oh no.. don‚Äôt have a panic attack in front of them, don‚Äôt seek re-assurance from today‚Äôs anxious thoughts and jitters. this is something that needs changing. it is more than ok for someone with diabetes to be comforted even when they de‚Äôs not all bad, i‚Äôm lucky to have family and a handful of friends that have seen me go though treatments and recovery so know the full spectrum of my issues and do not judge or baby me. i felt like sharing this little rant to hear your thoughts on if you‚Äôve been accepted or told to ‚Äòhide‚Äô symptoms from the public to spare their discomfort... like your doing it on purpose."
adhd,ptsd,813,"seriously. i never realized other people struggled with as many of the same things that i struggle with. finding this community helped me realize that i'm not alone, and helped me better understand my mental illness. i am so grateful."
bipolar,adhd,816,"so i have been working my ass off the past 2 1/2 years to get my head back together and take a bunch of classes i needed for education endorsements so i could get into masters in teaching program. i just found out i got into the program!!! wooo i'm going to grad school! 3 years ago i could barely get out of bed, this spring i'll be learning to teach at an excellent school and i just felt like sharing with people who would get how big of a deal this is to me. i am so happy."
bipolar,anxiety,821,i love how easy it is to go from not giving one shit about what other people think to giving all the shits. the paranoia that people are talking about me.t thought i really was just a horrible person. at least now i know that i just have a broken brain and not just a completely broken/ defective as a person.

anxiety,adhd,838,"i consistently talk to myself. sometimes i will sit down, and have conversations with myself. it's like a back and forth q&amp;a; as my mind wonders off about a curiosity, or unce""idiot"", ""stupid"", or ""loser"". in all honesty, i feel like i only call myself these names to motivate myself to do better next time. however, i'm not sure how helpful it really is."
anxiety,ptsd,844,"i feel like i've cried a dozen times since hearing about it, watching parents speak on the news and reading tweets from the kids who went to school there (including some who were horribly killed). for some reasoke everyone else i strongly believe children should be protected and put first no matter what so things like this are just... so unspeakable. i hope the gun laws in america change for the sake of school children."
anxiety,ptsd,846,"today i was triggered and had a massive, and i mean catastrophic panic attack. i couldn‚Äôt calm down and for the first time in a very long time, my mind went to some really dark places about not wanting to be here anymore. desperate for someway to handle the panic, i called the national suicide prevention hotline just to talk to his hotline if you need it. it can really help just to talk it out to a neutral third party who genuinely cares about you. you don‚Äôt need to feel ashamed or embarrassed of using this service. it is there for you. use all resources available to you. love to my other warriors ‚ô•Ô∏è here‚Äôs the number if anyone needs it: 1-800-273-8255"
depression,anxiety,849,you know the sound a plastic cup makes when you squeeze it too hard? when you are standing and talking to people and you look normal but you are trying so hard not twhite lines running down the side from where it bent. i feel like i am making the crackling noise and i am covered in white lines. it is stupid but it seemed fitting.
ptsd,bipolar,850,so for a bit of background. around 8 months ago or so my best friend claimed someone r*ped her. i got myself involved and messaged the guy. a couple of nights later he comes to my door at 11pm and can't get a doctors appointment just yet because my parents either can't be asked to go to the doctors or there to busy. i just want some supportive words or any advice on how to not think about it.
anxiety,ptsd,853,"after coming home from a nye party where i was strangely pleasant when i sobered up, aka no hangover headache or anything, i had such a nice day traveling home. now two days later i've been sitting in front of my pc a lot since i got homhe sense of tenseness. it's just a reminder for all of us i think. it's pretty darn constructive to move your body properly every once in a while if you're usually not very active. whenever the snow passes i want to start jogging again :)"
adhd,none,854,"edit: i said this as a joke, but that was before i saw just how many people end up owing ridiculous amounts of money. i am 100% going to talk to my university library about this now."
bipolar,anxiety,864,"came across this and thought they may be useful for anyone suffering from mild depression: does anyone religiously do cbt and if so did it help? **common cognitive distortions** a partial list from robert l. leahy, stephen j. f. holland, and lata k. mcginn‚Äôs [*treatment plans and interventions for depression and anxiety disorders*] (2012) 1. **mind reading** you assume that you know what people think without having sufficient evidence of their thoughts. ‚Äúhe thinks i‚Äôm a loser.‚Äù 2. **fortune-telling** you predict the future negatively: things will get worse, or there is danger ahead. ‚Äúi‚Äôll fail that exam,‚Äù or ‚Äúi won‚Äôt get the job.‚Äù 3. **catastrophizing** you believe that what has happened or will happen will be so awful and unbearable that you won‚Äôt be able to stand i feel now,‚Äù or ‚Äúmy parents caused all my problems.‚Äù 10. **what if?** you keep asking a series of questions about ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù something happens, and you fail to be satisfied with any of the answers. ‚Äúyeah, but what if i get anxious?,‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat if i can‚Äôt catch my breath?‚Äù 11. **emotional reasoning** you let your feelings guide your interpretation of reality. ‚Äúi feel depressed; therefore, my marriage is not working out.‚Äù 12. **inability to disconfirm** you reject any evidence or arguments that might contradict your negative thoughts. for example, when you have the thought i‚Äôm unlovable, you reject as irrelevant any evidence that people like you. consequently, your thought cannot be refuted. ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not the real issue. there are deeper problems. there are other factors.‚Äù"
adhd,depression,866,i am line cook at a grill&amp;bar restaurant making minimum wage &lt;-- which sucks ass. i am tired of working in the restaurant industry after long hours and shitty pays. time for me to book an appointment with my psychologist (i haven't seen my psychologist since last year) and go to college for a better life.
depression,bipolar,868,"i took a number of ssris during my last depressive episode and wellbutrin xl was the only one that made me flip into ""good days"" on occasion, however, would often slip back into depression after i went to sleep and woke up. i finally got out of my last depressive episode was flipped into a ""good day"" twice where i feel normal, energized, have my motivation back and feel like my old self. i tried to get angry and vowed to wake up to being feeling good, but sadly, the next morning i was back to a deep depression. has anyone else had this experience?"
bipolar,adhd,883,"i was curious what people thought if it so far. the little activities have been interesting, but the questions they ask about if you did this or that on these medications has been somewhat useless to me. i've been on multiple medications for the majority of my adult life, so i don't always remember what caused what. i always assumed the brain fog was related to medication, and i was really kind of sad to find that the disorder causes it."
bipolar,depression,893,"hello! i've had insomnia as early as age 7. at this point, my ability to fall and/or stay asleep is so difficult that i am taking sleep when i can. it's not the same as when you sleep a lot because you're depressed. it's just that if i feel sleepy at still able to maintain attendance at school and work. because of this, i've kinda rationalized sleeping this way. i've abided by all the sleep hygiene rules and still no cigar. so this is what i'm settling at. does anyone else do this or feel this way?"
depression,anxiety,896,"the shame and stigma that comes with being mentally ill can be very difficult to cope with, as most people can't see a crushed self like they see a broken leg. i have been going through the yet most difficult time, and what aches my heart is when i lose a friend or i feel the sucpesion of being lazy or acting up only se what i feel is taking life out of me every day, to many looks just like a failure at doing things right, or even if understood it still makes people undesirable and socially marginalized. so, is my thought common? or have i missed out on something that when i come to realize will make the thought sound preposterous?"

bipolar,anxiety,914,"i live with my family. we have different schedules so we don't see each other a lot. when we do, we get along okay, but they just don't understand me. it sounds super cliche but... we don't have a lot of the same things in common. they don't want to talk about the stuff i like to talk about, and on the off chance i do end up having a conversation about said things, i'm left feeling... ashamed? that's not the right word. kind of stupid, i gd the things i go through. and it's hard to find those kinds of people. i feel like the people around me are not on the same intellectual level as i am. not to say that they're stupid, because they're not, but our interests are just not the same. i need mental stimulation. i need adult conversation. i'm just here to vent, but is there anyone here who understands what i'm trying to say? i'm in my mid 20's, but i feel like an angsty teenager."
bipolar,adhd,921,"funny thing happened at a bar after a halloween comedy show. for halloween a guy dressed up as a cog in the capitalist machine. so i asked him, ""as a cog in the machine too but that's not what i was asking"" he also told me he finally got medicated and diagnosed properly after 27 years so i thought that was nice. he seemed really happy."

depression,ptsd,961,"i don't just mean because i haven't slept, although sometimes that is the case. what i really mean is i'm tired of fighting. i'm tired of feeling worthless and useless. i'm tired of trying so fucking hard and it still not being enough. i'm tired of getting up again. i'm tired of lying. i'm tired of people taking advantage. i'm tired of people not understanding. i'm tired of the pain. i'm tired of surviving. i'm tired of existing. i'm so goddamn tired"

anxiety,depression,996,"the older i get, the worse i seem to be at, i don't know, functioning in general. i used to be really sociable, have plenty of friends, i did well in school, had hobbies and interests - i was weird, but enough people liked me that i didn't think about it. after high school it was like the blinders were taken off and i started to see all these things about myself that i really, really hated. i started struggling a lot in social situations, i flunked out of a really good university, i couldn't hold a job, i gradually lost contact with my friends... i was a mess. but i got back up. it was a little harder than before but i still had enough momentum to keep going. i moved back to my ollet myself become. i think a big part of my problems is that i'm so used to trying and failing that i'm afraid that's the only outcome if i try again. i look at myself and think ""i've given up,"" because i have. i don't want to! but i don't know how to make life work for me anymore. i don't know how to connect with people. i go out somewhere and it's impossible to think or talk clearly through the static in my head that makes me nauseous and stutter and my heart pound. what kind of a life is one where you can't even talk to someone without turning into an idiot or crying after? i can't function like this. i'll never be able to work like this. has anyone overcome a similar situation?"

adhd,anxiety,1008,"you know how sometimes you'll just remember something in the past you did and cringe at yourself and its like, kinda physically painful? that's the feeling i'm talking about. for most people it just kinda comes and goes and they are fine bearing it for a moment, however i seem to either be hypersensitive to the feeling or just really bad at regulating it (probably a bit of both tbh), as half the time ""i wanna punch myself"" doesn't stop at just being a descriptor of how and feel and ends up being a bit of how i cope with it til it passes :/ i'll end up hitting myself on my leg or arm or something or punching a nearby wall as a way to relieve the tension, never hard enough to leave a lasting mark but often enough to be worrisome. i know it's not healthy but i don't know what else to do cuz the feeling is otherwise ui'll end up having a panic attack, yet i pretty much never actively avoid possible triggers and even signed up for my school's improv and dance clubs completely out of my own freewill (actually participating, however, is a different matter). basically, never happens to me lol. does anyone have any advice on better ways to cope with the cringe feelings, or with just emotional regulation in general? i'm on ritalin ir rn and while it does seem to help a bit, the problem is still very present, especially later in the evening or at night where i'm more tired and the meds have worn off. **tl;dr i have general emotional regulation problems and specifically always end up coping with ""cringe"" feelings with self harm. does anyone have advice on healthier ways to cope or other general help with emotional regulation?** thanks!"

adhd,none,1108,"how often have we heard, ""you just need to try harder,"" or ""i find it boring too, but my parents taught me to stick to it,"" or ""you're smart but so lazy!"" the problem seems to me that for some reason people believe that everyone is capable of the exact same amount of willpower. they accept that people have different levels of intelligence, that a kid who can't solve a math problem as quickly as another could have a lower iq or a learning disability and really needs extra help. we don't blame their moral character for being less intelligent, we accept that it is a function of their brain beyond their control. but with willpower, which is actually just motivation and sustained attention, wes not try his best in most classes."" so now it is the kid's fault. it's really hard for people to accept this because they like to think of their work ethic, their ability to stick with things as a personal victory, as part of their moral fiber. they don't want to think of it as good luck in getting a well functioning brain. what do you think? does this sound accurate to your experience? tl;dr: people see intelligence as a brain function and having a low iq as bad luck. but they see willpower as a character trait taught by good parents and as a personal victory that every person is equally capable of and those with poor motivation and attention as morally flawed or failed by bad parents."
ptsd,anxiety,1109,"i was 21 at the time, now i'm 22. in may of 2017, i got really sick out of no where. in a matter of 3 days, i went from feeling slightly out of it, to intense thunderclap headaches, pale, body aches, delirium, and ultimately passing out. i didn't want to make a scene or go to the hospital because i was just starting a new full time job, but i had a feeling that i was going to die. i can't really explain that very well, but i just knew deep down that someone was very wrong. at 4am i took an uber to the hospital and when i got there, upon checking my vitals (very low blood pressure and 160 resting heart rate) the nurses helped me onto a wheelchair and wheeled me into a bed in the intensive care unit. at this point, my memory is very groggy but i remember multiple people helping me take my clothes off to change me into a gown, and then doing an ecg on me. they got an iv into me and gave me a valium injection, as well as nausea medicine. i thought that was odd because i didn't feel nauseous at the time. the doctor came in and asked me what was wrong. i just cried and said my head hurt so bad, adn't push me too hard my fist few weeks back (i have a very physical job). now i'm healthier, but i still have a constant fear of getting sick again. i try to explain this to my mom and friends, but they think i'm just being dramatic and a hypochondriac. i don't feel safe anywhere but the hospital. i'm constantly scared. i don't have a fear of death, but knowing that i could easily become diseased and suffer, and leave all that i love behind makes me sad. it makes me sad that people don't understand what i went through. they are not educated on sepsis and think well ""hey, she didn't have cancer"" (my coworker actually said that, and later attributed my sepsis to being a vegetarian). i really don't talk about it a lot, but when i do, i get eye rolls. it's like people think i enjoyed taking a month off work. i constantly suffer from panic attacks now, where i feel dizzy and can't breathe well, but there's not much i can do about that. ativan doesn't help. my body and mind have been through hell and no one understands, or gives a shit. thank you for reading, i just had to get this off my chest."

depression,anxiety,1319,"you can cuss me out with insults, you can treat me like a subhuman, you can spit in my face, whatever. but please, please don't ignore me. i want my existence to be acknowledged. i want to be sure that i'now i suck, and i know i fuck everything up frequently, and you're welcome to hurl expletives at me for it. i deserve it. but whatever you do, i'm begging you, *please* don't act like i'm not there at all."
anxiety,depression,1322,i feel drained and exhausted. every day. even when i exercise. i'm so lonely but no one ever hangs out with me or talks with me. most of my friends left and now i'm back to where i started. :/ i feel guilty to and idk why. i've never experienced this type of sadness before
bipolar,ptsd,1324,"35(m), recently divorced and lost my job on monday due to a nervous breakdown. i'm in the first week of 30 day outpatient treatment program, seeing the psychiatrist tues. ex (43f) didn't believe my need for mental health care and we got in plenty of fights over it throughout our 8 years. the irony is that she's a nurse. she left me for my boss w and it feels like a victory to have the opportunity to see a therapist 3x a week after being told for years that i wasn't permitted or the relationship would suffer or end. i spend lots of time right now laying on my back staring at the ceiling while ugly crying. i've read a bunch of your stories and i think you're all very strong. much respect."
anxiety,adhd,1326,"seriously. a minute ago, i was shoveling food into my mouth. i felt like i had a billion things to do at the moment, even though in reality i had a lot of time to do those things. i felt light headed and my heart was rac change things up. (forgive me if this is an obvious lpt. it's certainly not new because i've been told it countless times, but i've often overlooked it. hopefully this will help those of you who overlooked it as i have.)"
ptsd,bipolar,1345,"just, come on, universe! really? this therapist saved my life, i owe everything to her, but now i have to watch her go through chemo and radiation completely helpless to douse the chemo fucks with her brain. i'm not looking for sympathy or advice, just a rant because it feels like the one thing in the whole world that i can't discuss with her."
bipolar,anxiety,1346,"i've noticed a theme in my negative thoughts about myself in the last year has been a focus on this idea that i'm a failure. it's something i think all too many of you can relate to, and something i hereby challenge you to do with me. i'll do it in the comments so it doesn't overshadow your accomplishments (because i want to hear about them and be proud of you!) or turn into nk of other things i've done i can be proud of, and maybe it'll help us see some of the awesome things you've done in life that you might not appreciate for its level of awesomeness. so...what in life was hard for you that you managed to do anyway? what was something you did that's been hard for other people that wasn't hard for you? what've you worked at? stay awesome, folks."
bipolar,adhd,1351,"i was cleaning out my closet &amp; emptying out drawers i haven‚Äôt touched in years... i found the box where i used to stash my shit. it looked like there was some 5 year old shake, my favorite old bowl, &amp; what looked like a little under a gram of coke (which still smelled potent). it definitely took me ab i know we‚Äôve all been in dark places, but you can get out. things will get better. and one day you‚Äôll look back and not even recognize the old you. stay faithful. keep your heads up. i hope any of you struggling with substance abuse like i was before i was diagnosed could experience what i just did one day. x"
adhd,none,1360,something i see mentioned a lot in this sub is people mentioning thy carry their daily doses in pill containers on keychains instead of the prescription bottle. just wanted to remind everyone that these are controlled substances and illegal to carry without a prescription. i don charge. obviously this charge would be dismissed once you show proof of prescription but please keep this in mind. a good way to have proof on you at all times is to take a picture of your pill bottle each time you fill your prescription since you always have your phone on you.
anxiety,depression,1365,"get off the phone, get off twitter, get off the computer, get off reddit, turn off the news, get off whatever you gotta. do whatever you got to to avoid th for a drive, go shopping, go do something to get your mind off of it. turn off all the bad stuff that‚Äôs pushing you down and go out and get some fresh air."
adhd,depression,1369,thank you to this [wonderful who went waaaay out of their way to try and hurt my feelings but ended up turning a bad day into a good one because it reminded me that some people have it worse. there are people out there who only feel good when they make others feel bad and those are the people to feel truly sorry for. i'm so flattered that they saw me as a target :)
bipolar,ptsd,1375,"do any of you have or had trouble taking responsibility for things? i'm 30 years old and feeling like i'm just now understanding my part in all the bad (and good) parts of my life. i recently realized how i treated my exes and the head games i played. i always thought ""head games"" we're intentional and this discovery has helped me forgive others because i don't think some of them meant to either. my last relationship had a lot of m i'm not diagnosed, i believe i have boarder line personality disorder. both of my more recent exes have told me i am abusive in my own ways (usually emotionally distant when needed but full on dependent during my own constant crises.) it's a damn shame i put so many men through hell without even taking their emotions seriously. anyway, those who share their problems with the blame game: do you have any suggestions? books? anything?"
depression,bipolar,1403,"i'm pretty sure it's the only thing that's keeping me alive, maybe not alive, but wanting to occasionally live. it's an escape, whether playing or listening. i'm glad i have it, but it's also scary to be so reliant on it. i do recordings and write songs, i guess it gives me a sort of purpose. if i do leave, i'll have something that people can look at and listen to as a reminder that i was maybe okay at something in my life."
ptsd,anxiety,1405,i've started to use cbd oil to manage my anxiety and i feel like a person again. i have energy to both accept any negative feelings i have and still put out a positivity to other people. which is something i strugglebetter in public in general. i can focus when i read and not forget things because i don't have my brain going a mile a minute. this stuff makes me feel like my life has changed drastically. i'm so grateful it exists.
bipolar,anxiety,1408,"sorry for the rambling post. i just need a safe place to vent. i'm pretty much losing it. i haven't been to work all week because i'm crippled with anxiety and i've been super irritable, lashing out,t know if it will do much good as i know that when i get out i won't be able to afford the medication they'll put me on and i'll be back to square one. i'm sorry. i just feel so overwhelmed right now."
bipolar,ptsd,1424,"i don't even know where to begin. i can barely hold my phone in my hands but these thoughts have to get out. i'm seeing signs that my mental health is suffering. i don't even want to talk about the flood anymore. i dont want to talk about my house, the work on my house, the everything. i'm so damn tired. i have eaten maybe 4 times since this all started. i've been working sun up-sun down on my house, with no luck in finding a contractor to help. yesterday was my birthday. i spent it gutting my walls and packing the few things we have left. i'm ""taking the day off"" to celebrate today... and i don't even want to. i can't sleep or eat. all i can do is stare at the wall and wonder what the actual fuexhausted. i'm mostly just depressed. actually since this started i've been episodic. right now my brain is running 10x its normal pace and i'm shaking and thinking all of these crazy thoughts and at the same time i'm numb and dont want to move or talk or eat or anything. every single day since this started i've lied in bed at night thinking how much i dont want to wake up. then when i wake up in the morning i start crying immediately when it all comes rushing back that this is my reality; this is my piss poor excuse for a human existence. fuck. i'm all over the damn place right now. thanks for reading, if you have. i'm not asking for a thing. i just needed to vent this out. i guess wish me luck."
depression,bipolar,1426,"i really let it get out of hand this time folks. i got an email today saying i‚Äôm being excluded from my academics (meaning won‚Äôt be able to go to class...) because i didn‚Äôt pass 2 of my classes. so now, my choices are 1. talk to the dean to see if i qualify for a cancellation of exclusion, 2. get suspended, or 3. drop out of school. this really pte limit. i‚Äôm not sure if i‚Äôll be able to take it. i can‚Äôt live with my parents again. my dad doesn‚Äôt believe in mental illness whatever that means. thinking about this situation makes me hate everything. im so done with life. i don‚Äôt know why i even try anymore. i knew i wasn‚Äôt cut out for college and i might as well give up and go waitress again"
bipolar,adhd,1428,"ugh, i hate how this time of year means increased social pressure. i hardly have the energy to socialize to begin with, but add all this holiday stuff on topso ... yeah ... thanks so much, but i have to go now."" i did manage to last a couple more hours but now i'm soooo tired. thank heavens my husband understands."
ptsd,anxiety,1430,"i feel completely trapped in my own head. i've had that ""chair is about to fall backward"" feeling day in and day out for like three weeks now. it's becoming exhausting. i feel like a thousand screaming emotions are trapped behind a stone exterior. i can't cry or yell or write. i can't express any emotions, even for moms most of the time, it's just particularly bad right now and trying to out-logic my emotions is just overwhelming sometimes. right now is one of those times. you guys are my people and i guess i'm not really looking for solutions, just someone to remind me that it will pass and maybe offer up some tips on self-care."
anxiety,adhd,1434,"i had the day off and it was only 30 dollars a day (minus fuel). i drove around all day looking for tough places to parallel park. i switched lanes, i hit the gas, parallel parked some more, tried different things, hard break, tried e as this one. all you need is some quality time with the vehicle. edit: i also got completely ass backwards lost and found my way back again via signs alone and even asked some stranger for directions. point is it's a great exercise."
anxiety,ptsd,1436,like i hate it for two reasons because first of all it either emasculating or infantilising. and second it implies that im not doing my best or at the least not trying or sometimes it comes off as someone making light of my feelings.
adhd,bipolar,1439,"it's the highest my gpa has been in my entire life. i can hardly begin to describe the combination of triumph and excitement and hope for what's to come, along with with the melancholy of what could've been, and the dread for how it might all go wrong. you guys know the feeling i'm talking about right?"
anxiety,none,1444,"1. despite the buffoon serving as the american president, there are other elected officials and higher ups whose voices matter too. despite the words coming out of his mouth, he doesn't have a giant dashboard of buttons he can shoot missiles out of. stop watching so many movies. 2. war is costly. nobody wants it, and all tas previously threatened both guam and hawaii, and is no stranger to threats. worse situations have happened in the past. just to list a few: the cuban missile crisis, the cold war, etc. and yet we are all still here. while the situation isn't a good thing, you and your friends will be fine. carry on with your daily lives."
anxiety,depression,1445,"tired of knowing who i am, but not what i want to be. tired of society deciding where i should be at in life and what i should be doing. tired of feeling like all i've done is waste my time not knowing what to do. tired of being told to make a difference in the world. tired of feeling lied of looking at others achievements and feeling perpetually inferior. tired of feeling like i'm in some race that i'm losing. tired of self doubt. tired of this never-ending cycle. i'm exhausted and i don't know what to do about it. does anyone else feel this way? if so, what did you do?"
ptsd,depression,1453,"i‚Äôm so tired of having bad memory, it makes me feel so stupid. i‚Äôve been watching the star wars movies with my boyfriend for the last week and i can‚Äôt remember hardly anything. i get the basic plots but names and details are always lost on me. i have to ask questions the whole time and it‚Äôs genuinely creeping out my boyfriend. he doesn‚Äôt understand how i can forget a detail from 20 minutes ago. i‚Äôm just sad. i use to have great memory and now i can‚Äôt even enjoy entertainment. i just feel like a shell."
anxiety,adhd,1454,"i stay away from family and live with my roommate who literally games all the fuckin time! it's like he is happy he doesn't have to go to college anymore this is a blessing for him. he has no other interests i'm stuck in my head all day! this pandemic really makes it worse for those who need distractions to escape from all the overthinking and anxiety! trying to develop new hobbies such as reading and stuff, watching shows and movies also gets boring after a while"
none,depression,1468,i think that may be one of the saddest songs in existence. is it pathetic that that song makes me cry whenever i take the time to sit down and listen to it? it is unbelievably sad.
adhd,depression,1470,"but i fucking did it y'all i wasn't late! i made it on time! i usually have to give myself like three hours in the morning to get ready because of how long it takes me, but i fucking hustled and i made in on time. i'm so proud of myself right now."
anxiety,ptsd,1485,"my wife passed out from a panic attack yesterday in the theatre while we were watching *a quiet place*. i was so scared and didn't know what to do. about an hour into the movie, there's a scene where someone steps on a nail. it wasn't even very gory, but i guess it triggered some bad memories for her. a few seconds after that scene, my wife's arm started twitching kind of like a seizure. at the same time, she started making sounds like she was snoring or maybe choking. when i looked at her, her head was lolled to the side and her eyes were closed. not realizing what was happening, i nudged her a bit, thinking she had fallen asleep. when her head rolled to the other side and there wasn't any other response my concern sky-rocketed. i took her head in my hands and gently shook her a little bit trying to wake her up. her eyes partially opened, and i could see her pupils were looking up like when you roll your eyes. there was no other response. i tilted her head forward and the ""snoring"" sound stopped, but she was still unconscious. at this point, about half a minute or so had passeder feel safe. i tried to just hold her and comfort her. after about a half hour she was doing better. i felt so helpless when she was unconscious. it's very scary when you suddenly realize your loved one is having a medical emergency. later in the evening, she revealed to me that when she was a teenager, she had an abusive boyfriend that would rape her, cut her with a scalpel, and poke her with needles. sick stuff like that i guess. she wouldn't say much more about it than that. i am angry. not at her, but at the thought some sicko did this to her. and i hurt. i grieve that she has experienced something so traumatic it causes this type of thing. she agreed we will get her into some therapy. she needs healing that i never knew she needed. i also know this isn't about me, but i feel a bit hurt this is just now coming out. we've been married about 5 years, and i never knew this stuff. what else don't i know? i don't know what type of advice i'm looking for. how can i be there for her? how can i help? what do i do if this happens again? did i do the right thing both during and after?"
