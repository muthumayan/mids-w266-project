anxiety,depression,1,"tomorrow i bury my best friend who tragically passed away at the age of 25. i'm heartbroken and i will be speaking at his funeral. i am happy with the speech but i am nervous, petrified to mess up. he was an incredible guy and i want to send him off well, justify what he meant to me. my ex who broke up with me 2 months ago has kept contact to ask how i have been doing and if i ever needed anything go to her. i went to the gym yesterday evening just to pass the time and maybe work off a small hangover i was nursing from the night before. i felt okay but by the end of my session i was very tired. as i was walking back towards my flat i spot my ex with a guy next to her sitting down. i could have turned around but i didn't. i go up to her and say hi, she seems shocked to see me and asks if i'm doing okay. i say no, not really and say i'll leave them to it and say goodbye. as i walk down the road my ex has caught up with me after she runs to catch up with me. she says she has done this to tell me thatuy who has a family that makes her laugh, feel alive. this guy has a child. i recognise him from her xmas party. i'm really confused about why she chased after me. it's obvious she cares but is she feeling guilty, trying to spare my feelings in the hardest time of my life. i do want her back in my life but seeing her with another guy hurt big time. seeing them close to each other eating ice cream. she works with him, did she like him when we were dating. i also hate the idea of her sharing her sympathy and support with other people, especially a guy like that. and it hurts to hear her say to me he's going through a hard time. i'm going through the hardest time of my life. i feel like i can't use her as a crutch. i'm so confused, hurt, a mess. i bury my best friend tomorrow . i am absolutely terrified. i feel sick, like i'm going to mess up and ruin everything. the last 2 months has been the worst of my life, it just has. i want things to be better. i want him back. i want her back. i feel terrible."
depression,adhd,5,"does anyone else ever feel like... they aren’t doing things for enjoyment but they’re just doing manual controls of themselves bc they have to? “ okay now it’s time to eat. okay that’s done, now it’s time to lay down. okay that’s done, now it’s time to see your friends” but everything really just feels like you’re going through the motions without any real enjoyment?"
adhd,anxiety,9,"fuck. i can't filter out certain noises and it makes my head feel likes it's gonna explode. it makes me really anxious. i feel like everything is on maximum volume at all times and i can't put it on mute. the walls in my house are thin, and i can hear every footstep and deep voices feel like they're vibrating and it makes me want to rip my hair out. noise sensitivty feels like an itch i can't scratch. if this happens to you guys, what do you do to help it? i'm quickly going mad!"
depression,ptsd,12,"that’s the best i can explain how i feel, i guess. it’s odd, but the only thing i’ve felt for a while now, so is strangely comforting due to its consistency. i feel as if i’m very detached from my own body, and am sometimes taken aback when i see myself ieverything (sometimes called creepily observant). i don’t know how to describe it, really. justa constant star of being “out of it”. i was just curious if anyone else feels the same way? let me know if you do and we can try and explain it to each other :)"
adhd,bipolar,13,"i always forget to respond to friend's text messages and even my girlfriend's. after i read them too! i have definitely upset some people, and i feel like i'm not giving my girlfriend the right amount of attention. it's like i get distracted thinking about what i'm going to reply with!"
depression,anxiety,14,"it took almost 2 hours to get out of bed, and i cried the whole time i was in there, but i showered. i actually washed my hair and stuff too. super late edit: thank you to everyone who responded. i am still doing ok- my hometown had some nasty storms and it knocked out the internet for quite some time. we had power, just a backlog of people demanding expedient customer service from america's worst customer service provider/cable &amp; internet provider (you know who you are there have been a few days that, now that spring has sprung, i decided to give myself a project. i will be upgrading my back yard into a beautiful garden. the flowers and the sun, i think, will do me a lot of good. on good days i can work outside and on bad days i can browse pintrest and reddit for new ideas. this is the most excited, the most anything i've been in a long time. and it started with your support and a simple shower. you're all so wonderful, thank you so much."
bipolar,anxiety,21,"i'm just curious to see if this happens to anyone else; the title is pretty self explanatory. (tl;dr at bottom) i don't mean like i'm ""out of it"" or even just fatigued for the day and my brain loses its train of thought one too many times. i feel like that happens to everyone at least once in a while (including myself). i mean like it takes an insane amount of mental energy for me to say a sentence from start to finish correctly, usually takes me a few tries to do so. so to say a 3 sentence response to somethiow to speak in general. anyone else have similar experiences? tl;dr: does anyone sometimes find their speech to be very impaired, like you feel as if you forgot how to speak at all? maybe due to an episode, personal issues, both, etc? edit: thank you so much everyone who replied to this post, sharing your experiences and such. one of my biggest insecurities is my speech (due to the issue mentioned in this post) and it's so comforting to have so much nice, supportive feedback and to know i'm not alone on this :)"
bipolar,adhd,25,"i do at times. sometimes i will say ""the splu biders"" or ""tub bath"". reading is fine and easy, not dyslexic at all but the speech is weird. today i forget to take my meds, and found it to be worse than normal (with meds). anyone else experience this?"
none,anxiety,27,"yesterday, after finishing my office work i left for home in my car. on the way i saw my neighbour walking on the footpath. i offered him a lift. he politely refused saying he is in a hurry."
ptsd,anxiety,28,"i only feel comfortable communicating with people who have some sort of serious mental health issue themselves as well, or are professionals in the field, thus very understanding. i am so tired of being lonely and limited in my abilities to make connections with people."
adhd,anxiety,32,"you know how sometimes you'll just remember something in the past you did and cringe at yourself and its like, kinda physically painful? that's the feeling i'm talking about. for most people it just kinda comes and goes and they are fine bearing it for a moment, however i seem to either be hypersensitive to the feeling or just really bad at regulating it (probably a bit of both tbh), as half the time ""i wanna punch myself"" doesn't stop at just being a descriptor of how and feel and ends up being a bit of how i cope with it til it passes :/ i'll end up hitting myself on my leg or arm or something or punching a nearby wall as a way to relieve the tension, never hard enough to leave a lasting mark but often enough to be worrisome. i know it's not healthy but i don't know what else to do cuz the feeling is otherwise ui'll end up having a panic attack, yet i pretty much never actively avoid possible triggers and even signed up for my school's improv and dance clubs completely out of my own freewill (actually participating, however, is a different matter). basically, never happens to me lol. does anyone have any advice on better ways to cope with the cringe feelings, or with just emotional regulation in general? i'm on ritalin ir rn and while it does seem to help a bit, the problem is still very present, especially later in the evening or at night where i'm more tired and the meds have worn off. **tl;dr i have general emotional regulation problems and specifically always end up coping with ""cringe"" feelings with self harm. does anyone have advice on healthier ways to cope or other general help with emotional regulation?** thanks!"
bipolar,depression,38,"last week i wore my hair up everyday to work. not because i particularly like the way it looks, but because i couldn’t will myself the effort to take a shower for 5 days. wearing my “depression” hoodie that is 3 sizes too big, just so i can ignore my weight issue and have it’s dog hair covered fabric drape around my already dirty pajama shirt that i wore the last 4 nights. being this kind of sad is funny that way even something as mundane and rudimentary as doing my laundry takes more effort f glitter about to explode taking shots at the bar with my friends and oversharing too much with too many people this happiness turns agitated and irritable every small inconvenience feels like i might just turn green, sprout some brown shorts and call myself hulk like a rubber band that is twisting tighter and tighter until it snaps. and cuts my arm with an exacto knife and down i fall again… when people ask me how i am they should just ask me who i am today and what does my laundry look like"
ptsd,none,43,sensory goods. i bought one from them a few years ago and it’s great. im buying a second one for my grandson. they talked me into glass beads. i think it’s sand actually. this time i ordered it with plastic beads. then i’ll take whichever he doesn’t prefer. i hope it helps someone. anyways-here’s the code i just used. 20% off and free shipping. fb20
anxiety,depression,45,i had a little numbness on my left side of my chest now im kinda bugging out while at work. and i cant stop thinking about it just want to know if thats normal for anyone. edit thank you all for your responses glad to know im not the only one feeling this way. i hope that you all can feel a little better.
depression,anxiety,48,i can't stand how people these days are patting themselves on the back for spreading awareness about mental health. there is still so much farther to go. we have not made nearly enough progress for complacency.
depression,bipolar,60,"am i the only one? am i being rude? there’s this coworker of mine who’s always so cheerful and laughs super loud and high pitch like some disney character. i try to think positive and understand that she’s actually a sweet person, but she irritates me. aaaand truthfully... i used to be bubbly and a people person. then shit happened. and now i just want to be left alone in silence. with my cat."
adhd,depression,71,"i see your, our, struggle. evolution made us this way for a reason. we have a purpose. but it's really fucking hard to find that in this fucked up modern society. imagine. lots  structure or organisation. ok maybe bring a handful of neurotypicals for the paperwork. yeah i'm in total denial of the world we actually live in. too painful to face the truth."
ptsd,anxiety,73,"i seem to get so agitated sometimes, whether it’s with my family or friends, and i’m just to afraid to tell people why. i just constantly feel worthless, and i’m always on depressed and on edge. i wish i could just tell people why."
anxiety,ptsd,75,feel free to message me anytime. i may not always be able to reapond right away but i always respond eventually and i never ghost away. i try my best to hold conversation woth anyone. i love you all.
adhd,depression,85,"this cycle repeats itself until we/i get depressed--a low level but long lasting state of depression without swings, without strong emotions, a sort of vacant aand ashamed, but because of circumstance theres nothing that kicks us into gear. feel free to vent and support others, different perspective is good perspective!"
bipolar,adhd,92,"so last time i saw them they flat out said they don't trust me to take my meds and that even though i said i would, they don't believe me. then they told me i'm a liar because i've gone off meds before and told no one. first, yes i did go off my meds before for a lot of reasons but i always ended up getting back on them. this time i stopped for a stupid reason and i acknowledgeto take my meds without even asking why i stop them in the first place. they said they will cancel my prescription if the blood test results are low and they are not concerned that i'll be without meds. they were like, go to your gp if you like but i'll leave her a note. so i can't even go to my gp. tl;dr: i can't trust my own team anymore and i don't know where to go from here."
bipolar,adhd,93,i promised a friend i'd make a poster and a pin the tail on the donkey game for his kid's birthday. then i forgot - because my own kid had a school project that i threw all my free time this week into. i remembered thursday at work abofeel stupid for this. i also had a twelve hour work day yesterday and it's a job that requires tons of running. i hope they're happy with it all. if they're not... i guess i'll just have to accept that and know that i gave it my best!!!
ptsd,bipolar,95,"i feel completely trapped in my own head. i've had that ""chair is about to fall backward"" feeling day in and day out for like three weeks now. it's becoming exhausting. i feel like a thousand screaming emotions are trapped behind a stone exterior. i can't cry or yell or write. i can't express any emotions, even for moms most of the time, it's just particularly bad right now and trying to out-logic my emotions is just overwhelming sometimes. right now is one of those times. you guys are my people and i guess i'm not really looking for solutions, just someone to remind me that it will pass and maybe offer up some tips on self-care."
none,adhd,101,"maybe this way of saying it is fine, but when people ask around and compare test scores, i genuinely believe and want to tell people that they shouldn't focus on what other people scored but focus on themselves and their own work. i don't want to sound too formal or even rude since i am a student. so how should i reply to people asking whatever test mark i received?"
adhd,bipolar,103,something i see mentioned a lot in this sub is people mentioning thy carry their daily doses in pill containers on keychains instead of the prescription bottle. just wanted to remind everyone that these are controlled substances and illegal to carry without a prescription. i don charge. obviously this charge would be dismissed once you show proof of prescription but please keep this in mind. a good way to have proof on you at all times is to take a picture of your pill bottle each time you fill your prescription since you always have your phone on you.
ptsd,anxiety,104,"i’m incredibly nervous but i’ve decided to try some medical marijuana this week. maybe next if i chicken out. something has to change. i feel like i’ve been doing whatever i can for the last two decades and plateaued with my health in the last four years or so. my medication, support system, physical activity level, and therapy are helpful but i still feel very frostrain is tailored to my issues and i trust my “bud tender” but am terrified to lose control. but i think it could be the best type of exposure therapy for me. obviously my greatest fear is losing control but having a mild experience with some mj and facing it could be helpful. or it could be really, really bad. anyone relate to this or have tried anything similar ?"
bipolar,adhd,106,"i was waiting for the bus after my group ended at the outpatient clinic outside the hospital. i was walking when i saw a male, on hospital grounds near the emergency room and outpatient clinic entrance, slitting his wrists with a razor. there were people everywhere. a group of women were sitting right next to him- but they all did nothing! i ran back into the hospital and told security about the man- but they also stood thhelp him. we were also across the street from a mental health emergency clinic. last week, i traveled outside the state to visit my brother who lives in a homeless shelter, and suffers from schizophrenia. i was just given a surprise diagnosis of add as well which has me worried sick. i also just celebrated my 30th birthday, but i feel like a complete mess! i don't know what to do besides remind myself 'that this will pass.'"
ptsd,anxiety,107,"my lovely husband came home tonight and i have just triggered off him big time. i want to punch his face in. seriously he hasn’t done anything other than talk to me about upgrading a computer. i’m scared and angry and just want to attack him both physically and verbally. [fightause this, he hasn’t done anything wrong. i let him know i needed some space. then i wrote this! it feels good to get these thoughts out. thanks for listening. it would help me to know i’m not the only one that feels like this. hope it helps you if you have experienced this too."
ptsd,depression,111,"almost pulled out of the gas station and hit someone. i didn't and stopped just in time. the driver gets out and starts yelling at me and i said i'm sorry. it was an honest mistake. i wasn't cutting him off or anything. now, i'm yelling and telling him to go, but he wont. he blocked me in. so i just lay't see it going well... i'm just not strong enough for this world. it's even just the little things. someone's tone of voice, body language or a way someone words something. im tired of walking around d on egg shells and taking all my strength to try to live a normal life. it's all just weighing me down."
adhd,bipolar,115,"it's so easy. step one: be unemployed, incredibly poor and three months behind on your rent. step two: desperately need to submit job applications, apply for temp work and sell things. step three: just do all that other stuff instead!!!!!! hope this helps guys! 👌💯😘"
adhd,ptsd,116,"for example, there’s so many items and guns left behind in places you raid in fallout and i just can’t leave the place without literally doing every side thing, killing every guard and getting the best equipment. what happens from that is it takes me ages to play the game which leads me to give up without finishing the story line. sorry mods if this is a faq or common post, i just am bad at researching lol"
depression,anxiety,117,"we've been dating the past month and i got the balls to ask her out. she said she'll think about it which means no, but i still got the nerve to do it! 😃"
depression,bipolar,125,"i’ve been having the worst time of my life these past months and in return, i’ve been late on assignments. my parents know that i’ve been dealing with really’m too focused on how bad everything is. they never ask me how i’m doing, they ask me if i️ve gotten any homework done yet. and i️ just can’t take it anymore."
depression,adhd,126,"-- getting dressed is hard. -- getting shit started is hard. -- getting shit finished is hard. -- making tea... that's okay. -- drinking it, fine too. -- going to bed is hard. -- getting out of it is even harder. -- sitting on the computer, that's alright. -- getting work done, that's hard -- leaving the house, well i wouldn't know today. -- speaking is hard. -- laughing, that is good."
anxiety,depression,131,"so the title sums it up. i'm almost 28, all my friends are engaged, married or have a clatter of children. i have never even had a boyfriend in my life. i've had ""friend with benefits"" who in reality were not friends and have not benefitted me. i can see now i was used a practice girl before they moved onto women they actually care about. i have social anxiety and hate myself so expect others to hate me too. things like eye contact are very difficult. i use alcohol as a tool to try and be fun but it never really works out. not e first time in my life, he dumped me before i got that far. i'm not angry, i don't blame him, he just didn't feel the same way i do. it's left me absolutely broken. i believe im not good enough for anyone and don't see the point in going on anymore. i just go through the motions every day without feeling anything. i am on meds and see a doctor regularly but nothing helps. i tried counselling and could not talk. i have a history involving suicide and sexual assault and so trust is hard for me. i don't know where to go from here."
anxiety,ptsd,151,"im suffering from serious trauma from my past. my father beat me and molested me. he also kissed me on the lips and demeaned me treating me like a girl. every time he looked at me, itd make me feel belittled and raped. my housemate has the same insecure belittling qualities my father has. i was also beaten and emotionally manipulated by an abusive mother who beat me with a stick, only yelled and never spoke, used me to polish her ego, used me to shame my father, shamed me, embarrassed and belittled me by objectifying me and herself, and buriedit, call me fat and autistic, and just release his anger any chance he could in any way he could find using me. i need to get away from all this abuse. i want to love myself for who i am and comfort myself and be there for myself and love being me. i want my life back from all the abuse. i want to absolutely own my life. right now i need comfort and love and compassion and empathy for the little boy who was first beaten by his parents and left alone feeling abused and abandoned too young to do anything about it. its okay kyle. im here for you."
bipolar,adhd,155,"i am in grad school. i have two assignments to do before the end of the month and i'm not gonna do them. one was due dec 15, last year! accessibility services helped me get an extension to april 30. i haven't done any work on it. the anxiety is so high about it i'm not going to get it done. and i can't work on the other one, because then i'm not working on that one. i've sought help from accessibility services at school. i met with a learni the water. how many times do i get to ask for help? its not fair. i'm taking resources from the people who ask for help and then actually make use of it. the cycle is just going to continue. depression, procrastinate, anxiety, depression, ask for extension, depression, procrastinate, anxiety, depression. i hate it. it doesn't stop. my thoughts keep arriving at the only way to make it all stop entirely. but i don't want that. i don't think."
ptsd,adhd,164,i'm sorry i can't think straight now and i'm panicking and shaking and i can't quit crying like a goddamn baby. i just looked up this sub now never been here before. my husband is always sneaking up on me and i guess it's an accident but i can't handle it. i had just screamed myself awake for the third time tonight/ this morning (and he knew it) when he entered a room right behind me while i had my back turned a split second and i turned and screamed moreking progress and the cops don't know where he is. i'm seriously thinking of putting bells on my husband or making a rule he has to call and get a response before entering a room. but dammit that sounds so disfunctional and i think he'd forget anyway but what do i do????? i've told him to sing or hum or talk to the cats as he moves through the house so i can hear him but most often he never does. what can i do? please help. edit: cause i didn't make sense
adhd,depression,167,"edit: i would say that a comparison to how a ""normal"" person functions is this - a normal can stand in the middle of the room and softly bounce the ball repeatedly off one wall, but i am only able to throw the ball with extra strength and it essentially shoots out of my hand and requires other walls to bounce to."
anxiety,bipolar,177,"i quit my job today. it was fucking terrible. not quitting, but being there. from september, i've had the worst time working there and trying my best for an abusive relationship. it took every fiber of my being to go through with it, but i feel like i've shed a ten ton husk. long time lurker, but i had to make an account to post this."
bipolar,anxiety,182,"i'm in a weird situation. i'm far from being a celebrity, but i have... fans, because of one of my jobs (it's somewhat on the same level as amateur youtuber so nothing too big). i'm also a young illustrator working on a websithallenging because i'd have to take on the role of mental health advocate and would probably get asked lot of personal questions. on the other hand, i might be helping people in the ""you're not alone"" kinda way. is it worth it?"

bipolar,depression,194,"i was hospitalized over a week ago for a suicide attempt. since i've been on around 30 different meds without much results, i requested etc (electro convulsive therapy) since they did it at the hospital i was in. i got three rounds of treatment and my depression has been zapped out of my brain. i feel so much better. just had to share. :)"
anxiety,ptsd,197,"depersonalization/dissociating is the closest thing i've found to how i feel but not quite. i feel like i'm just floating through my days. like they fade into each other and i'm just trying to get through each one to make it into the next. i feel so like i can relate to anyone either, so i don't bother going out of my way to communicate with anyone (say in a class setting) which just adds to the not-present feeling. what is this called, if anything? and what can i do about it? i'm so miserable"
ptsd,depression,201,"i don't mean for this to be a huge downer, i've just been stuck in this rumination for a while now. even on my best days i feel disconnected and never able to fully live in the moment. i'm worrying about the past or future, i'm overthinking a million different moments and possibilities at once. i'm dissociating li. idk. i just feel like everyone is behind a glass wall can't cross. people are graduating and marrying and forming families and i just feel perpetually lost despite my efforts to get better. i think i just need a bit of hope. i'm trying though, i really am. i'm no longer on rock bottom but it's all just difficult."

depression,anxiety,204,"i wish i knew who to talk to, if i had anyone to talk to at all. a lot of the time, i'm too anxious to know what to do, and too worried to share my opinion or talk in public. i've gotten more irritable, and i hate it. at the same time, i wish i knew what i could do. how do you even make friends anymore? what do you do after you meet people?"

adhd,anxiety,538,"just in case anyone isn't aware of what learned helplessness feels like, and as a warning to people not to keep trying the same thing over and over, i've written the following. i will use the term ""brain"" to refer to the unconscious, impulsive parts of the brain, the parts that aren't ""you"", and ""you"" to refer to your conscious experience and rational brain. (disclaimer, this is only my experience, i don't know what other people's experiences are.) --- imagine walking around, going through life, except you don't decide what you do. your brain decides everything for you and you have no say. it wants to play video games, so you play video games. that isn't to say you don't fight it, but on those occasions that you do you either are simply unable to do anything, or every frustration with yourself for every past failure floods upon you, washing your willpower away in a tidal wave of anxiety. you quickly learn the only way to fight is to not fight at all. --- now, imagine somebody calmly tells you, ""i know it's hard, but you really need to just get up and do it. i have no magic bullet unfortunately."" this is nice, they know that you have a hard time ""just doing it"" but at this point there's no way around it, it just needs to be done. you wholeheartedly agree with them, and feel like the ultimate solution _is_ to ""just do it"". your brain however immediately reminds you how ""it's never worked before, so why will it work now?"" this isn't just a small voice, it is backed by the combined anxiety of every failure and inadequacy you have ever had. --- i'll attempt to explain what lies behind this sense of hopelessness: this sense of hopelessness, in its simplest form, is the feeling that ""it's never worked, so why would it change?"" however, it goes deeper than that. the following is the main thought process: - according to other people you just need to try hard enough to solve the problem - you feel like you have tried counn't care anymore"" ( ditto ) - ""i hate myself"" (when i metaphorically close my eyes, cover my ears, and run from what i need to do yelling ""lalalalalalalala"", also when i am sitting doing something i enjoy and remember what i'm supposed to be doing) - ""i just can't."" (when i try to calm myself or when i'm lying in a fetal position on the bed, spiraling deeper into depression) - ""i just want the world to go away"" (this feeling makes me realize why some people kill themselves. i fortunately just retreat to my bed or some form of entertainment that allows my brain to shut off temporarily) --- i'm not saying this is permanent problem, or that there aren't any solutions, just that it's incredibly difficult, more difficult than i feel most anyone can imagine. it's the torture of hopelessness, with the frustration of fully knowing with your rational brain that hope itself is all that is needed to solve the problem, yet finding that hope hopelessly far away. please, everyone. think before you tell someone to ""just try."" they may have forgotten how to. --- edit: some people may say that you just need to build in systems, and i agree that that is a good solution, but at least for me, i've tried so many of my own systems that even trying to talk with it causes my brain to lock up with anxiety. likely because it forces me to confront all my past failures, which further discourages me from trying. i'd still love to hear any advice people have though. --- tl;dr; learned helplessness isn't thinking you are helpless, it is feeling that you've forgotten how to try. if you really wanted to try it would have worked, since people say to just try, so you must not really _want_ to try, so you begin to instead want to want to try. in addition, confronting it in any way brings with it all the anxiety of every past failure, meaning that often, instead of doing something you often fail to do you just close your eyes and hope it'll go away."

adhd,bipolar,632,"so my last job was kind of a shit-show. i was having real issues with focus and staying interested at my last-last job (this was before i was diagnosed) and going through a lot of personal stuff in my life (divorce) i wanted to make more money, and get a change, and prove to my ex that i was capable. i let pride blind me, and i applied for a job as an embedded engineer with a local company. well... due to moving needs in the company, they decided they didn't really need an embedded guy at the time, and brought me on as a c# software developer to try me out. i volunteered on a large scale embedded project, learned a bunch of great embedded skills, and did a project my talents at day's end. i'm honestly pretty sure he was surprised as i was that i was let go, but the decision was made way above his head. i was pretty fuckin' bummed for the last month. anyway. just got a call yesterday from a small company looking to bring on a senior fpga engineer to lead their satellite technology development, and i believe i'm perfect for the role. i've always wanted to put stuff in to space, so i'm very stoked right now. i'm hoping the interview goes well, and that i manage to impress them. i could really use the win right now. also, now that i've got the meds, and i've got the right therapy, i really think this will be my chance to shine."

""i don't care if you fail, i care if you try."" too fucking bad dad, i care more if i fail than if i try, and i get that that doesn't get me anywhere; it feels pretty shitty to be reminded my ridiculous rejection sensitivity makes me a terrible person. fine, impedes my success. you didn't call me a terrible person. but that's what i'm getting at. the rejection sensitivity. what amounted to ""your not trying for the sake of avoiding getting hurt disappoints and irritates me"" turned into ""you're a terrible person."" or maybe i took it to mean ""you're broken."" i often think i am. how do you think it feels when i submit 10 job applications and my brain does the same thing about not hearing back? how do you think it feels to be constantly looking at jobs trying to balance what i'm qualified for, what won't be soul-crushingly mind-numbing, and what will actually move me forward in life? and then after beating myself up to get myself to start and continue that process, getting discouraged either not hearing back or hearing i didn't get the job. and then there's: what if i actually here back? interviews are std am now telling myself ""you're gonna be the lazy drug using social security beneficiary nobody wants to get their money"" while i tell myself i don't deserve it because i feel like a liar. but you know what? it may hurt, **but i take it on for you**. because i acknowledge my debilitating fear of trying on the job front and would rather take on shame than let my failure to launch weigh you down. when i was growing up, i used to tell myself ""no one can hurt you more than your own family."" i think that's still true for me today. thanks dad. *do you know why i changed therapists after you got your cancer diagnosis?* **i wanted to make sure you'd be proud of me before you died.** i sure as hell don't feel like you are right now. tl;dr: my dad hurt me and pissed me off by telling me he doesn't feel like i try and expressing frustration at how much time i put into videogames (where i can at least feel successful at **something**) when i spent less time on videogames today than half of what i spend most days in general. seriously, videogaming and weight loss are the only two things i've succeeded at since graduation. maybe not dying, too, but i don't think that should count. good to know i'm a disappointment."

bipolar,anxiety,696,"i started new meds a few weeks ago, and i think i found a good combination that works for me. i don't wake up wishing i was dead, i don't get irritable as much and i can go out in public without becoming super anxious. it's been harder to fall asleep and i have a few other small side effects, but they're not terrible. it's just nice to not be in a terrible mood 24/7. i hope others can find medications that work for them too!"

anxiety,ptsd,732,"my wife passed out from a panic attack yesterday in the theatre while we were watching *a quiet place*. i was so scared and didn't know what to do. about an hour into the movie, there's a scene where someone steps on a nail. it wasn't even very gory, but i guess it triggered some bad memories for her. a few seconds after that scene, my wife's arm started twitching kind of like a seizure. at the same time, she started making sounds like she was snoring or maybe choking. when i looked at her, her head was lolled to the side and her eyes were closed. not realizing what was happening, i nudged her a bit, thinking she had fallen asleep. when her head rolled to the other side and there wasn't any other response my concern sky-rocketed. i took her head in my hands and gently shook her a little bit trying to wake her up. her eyes partially opened, and i could see her pupils were looking up like when you roll your eyes. there was no other response. i tilted her head forward and the ""snoring"" sound stopped, but she was still unconscious. at this point, about half a minute or so had passeder feel safe. i tried to just hold her and comfort her. after about a half hour she was doing better. i felt so helpless when she was unconscious. it's very scary when you suddenly realize your loved one is having a medical emergency. later in the evening, she revealed to me that when she was a teenager, she had an abusive boyfriend that would rape her, cut her with a scalpel, and poke her with needles. sick stuff like that i guess. she wouldn't say much more about it than that. i am angry. not at her, but at the thought some sicko did this to her. and i hurt. i grieve that she has experienced something so traumatic it causes this type of thing. she agreed we will get her into some therapy. she needs healing that i never knew she needed. i also know this isn't about me, but i feel a bit hurt this is just now coming out. we've been married about 5 years, and i never knew this stuff. what else don't i know? i don't know what type of advice i'm looking for. how can i be there for her? how can i help? what do i do if this happens again? did i do the right thing both during and after?"

adhd,anxiety,779,ever since i can remember i've always been an extremely curious person and if i ever overheard someone talking about something like a secret or drama i would be dying to know what they were talking about and beg them to let me know too. right now i find myself absolutely torturing myself over my ex girlfriends in i grew to be such a manipulative person. so am i just nosey or you guys like this too? i also hate hate hate when someone starts to tell me something then says never mind and cuts it off. it can literally ruin the rest of my day if they refuse to tell me what they were gonna say (until i forget about it at least)

anxiety,depression,1120,"my doctor and counselor have me listed as extreme anxiety and depression, early childhood ptsd, bi polar, borderline personality disorder. it's a relief to have an answer to what my problems are. this has been an on going problem my whole adult life. my first job, i had reasons for being depressed. i dropped out of school, parents were divorcing and i didn't have a stable housing situation, i was falling behind and depressed, full of anger and anxiety. i didn't want to call myself weak though and admit i had a problem, so i attempted to self medicate by escaping reality. i skateboarded, played video games, drank, smoked weed, partied, did everything i could to feel numb. 5 years later, because i didn't seek help or medication early on, i was put on suicide watch due to my new medications not worki application. my point to all this is i would be homeless and probably dead without her. she has saved my ass countless times over the years,having a mental illness makes holding a job so fucking difficult, i've lost at least 6 jobs since being with her. i have nothing but respect and love for her to be putting up with all this, while we are both still fairly young (i'm 24, she's 21 later this year) i wish her parents understood mental illness, but it's kind of a taboo in her family so we keep things as vague as possible. i just hope that i get through to disability services and can make an income that way, to relieve some stress from her life. she put off school for me from the very beginning, the least i can do is help her get through school. sorry about the rant. i hope everyone has a great day."
bipolar,ptsd,1135,i can feel the floor dropping out like the last time i was hospitalized. i can't go back there. it was traumatic. i've tried every med and i'm terrified. i turn into a fpecting from this. i can't live like this. how do people make it? i can't believe i have to lose myself over and over until i die. i can't fucking do this. i'm so scared.

adhd,bipolar,1147,"i just thought it was funny that drugs are doing the exact opposite of how these people are implying it in this situation. i tend to argue with a wall of text for something that barely matters for me, likely so i can get my talking fix and 'cause it's stimulating."

bipolar,depression,1161,medication has never worked for me. years of trial and error with different meds and different dosages has left me with no hope. i wonder what it’s like to have a brain that actually wants to live.
depression,bipolar,1163,"i took a number of ssris during my last depressive episode and wellbutrin xl was the only one that made me flip into ""good days"" on occasion, however, would often slip back into depression after i went to sleep and woke up. i finally got out of my last depressive episode was flipped into a ""good day"" twice where i feel normal, energized, have my motivation back and feel like my old self. i tried to get angry and vowed to wake up to being feeling good, but sadly, the next morning i was back to a deep depression. has anyone else had this experience?"
anxiety,depression,1165,"i feel alone and useless unless i'm high or drunk. i might be failing classes at this point, or at least close to, but i can't go to class unless i'm on something without feeling like i want to kill myself or just give up completely. i'm even high right now, i haven't been sober in over a week."
adhd,bipolar,1172,"so, you've spent a while working hard at school/life/career/relationships. things have been going well, and all of a sudden some much needed time off comes along. you've got half the week off, and the other half is pretty light in comparison, so it's the fucking best. you can slack off a little bit, and let your mind wander, and there's no ill effects, because everyone does iticult. you got this. slowly scale back your bed time and get a little more rest each night. try to set some reasonable alarms for yourself this weekend, so you keep up the pattern of waking up before noon, and try to make a short to do list to be able to check off some accomplishments. remember, forgive yourself, and don't let any stumbles make you feel like everything is lost."

adhd,bipolar,1224,i have an issue with balance. i never know when i'm on the path to burnout until i get there because i don't know how to differentiate between pushing through for discipline or pushing myself past my limits. does that make sense? does anyone have advice?

depression,bipolar,1232,"the shame and stigma that comes with being mentally ill can be very difficult to cope with, as most people can't see a crushed self like they see a broken leg. i have been going through the yet most difficult time, and what aches my heart is when i lose a friend or i feel the sucpesion of being lazy or acting up only se what i feel is taking life out of me every day, to many looks just like a failure at doing things right, or even if understood it still makes people undesirable and socially marginalized. so, is my thought common? or have i missed out on something that when i come to realize will make the thought sound preposterous?"
anxiety,ptsd,1243,my anxiety when i first wake up everyday is so strong i struggle to leave my bed. i wake up from a typically sound sleep and get thrown into a shitstorm nearly everyday. i used to have ptsd related nightmares; thanki've tried grounding techniques. i've tried different types of weed and different benzos. i'm thinking about doing a small meditation everyday to see how that makes me feel- are there good apps out there i could try?
adhd,anxiety,1247,"video games, weed, watching porn, eating fatty foods, drinking, etc. these are all things i find very hard to control. when i smoke a bit of weed i crave more instantly and i don't stop smoking until i'm baked out of my mind. whenever i'm feeling bad i start overeating, which leads to me feeling worse, which leads to more overeating. whenever i feel bored (which is quite often) i play video games. this leads to me using only video games for pleasure and to esccult emotions, and i dull myself with unhealthy behaviours, instead of just accepting the emotions and processing them in a healthy way. when i stop using these behaviours the negative thoughts and emotions start hitting me very hard. but probably that's just a phase you have to go through, to get out better on the otherside. are there others who struggle with balancing life like me? if you've found a solution, please elaborate. is this just a discipline thing?"
anxiety,depression,1249,"i constantly feel like i’m being lied to. i overanalyze things, my brain always finds a way to twisted things people say so it seems like a lie. my head hurts and i often cry. things started to feel like this since i was being cheated on 6 years ago."

depression,bipolar,1257,"don’t get me wrong , i’m very grateful that i can take care of myself , but i’m still depressed so i think i get at least some leeway to be pissed about this . what i hate is that when you’re high functioning you don’t have an illness to fall back on . it’s like when arthur fleck says “the worst part about having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don’t” . that’s extremely true in all cases but that’s how i feel right now as a high functioning . when you’re not high functioning people see that you’re not okay and the cut you some slack ing . i’ve been depressed for the last four years , but i’m high functioning so is it really valid ? when you don’t feel like cleaning or doing your laundry you’re dirty . when you can’t bring yourself to pick up after yourself you’re dirty . and why’s that ? because nothing is wrong with you and there’s no reason for you to be doing this . they don’t understand depression and it shows . it’s just annoying when you have to be normal like everyone else even though you constantly struggle and nobody sees that . it’s like if it isn’t tangible it just isn’t true !"

depression,bipolar,1292,"now that i've struggles with this bullshit for 7 years, i've come to the realisation that literally no one cares no one is genuinely there for you. everyone will claim to be there for you and beg you to open up to them because they want to be the hero who 'saves'd because you just can't quite bring yourself to talk to people. going through days of mania followed by weeks of lowness and having people expect you to be okay because of those few days of mania everyone wants to be there for you until you actually show symptoms"

depression,bipolar,1370,"a bit of background about me: male, turned 25 last week. i just feel like i have nothing and no one to live for. i’ve been really struggling lately. the people i count on to come and talk to when i feel like shit just flat out don’t answer my texts, so i’ve stopped bothering texting them. the only girl i’ve ever been into shot me down and also never answers my messages either. so i stopped texting her as well. no one bothers checking on me so why should i reach out to them? my aunt died from brain cancer 3 years ago. and my older sister was killed by a drunk driver. i was seeing a therapist but stopped because i couldn’t afford it. they care more about money than the health of their clients. america summed up in one sentence i guess. i dropped out of engineering school in october after 6 years of college and multiple majors, 6 classes shy of graduating because i just didn’t wanna do it anymore. i was burned out and sick of busting my ass with nothing to show for it but exhaustion and stress. i may or may not go back. my student loans are due starting in june which i can’t afford. i have a car payment on top of it, paying for a car that i never wanted in the first place with money that i don’t have. i only bought it to shut my parents up about it, because my other one which i much prefer wouldn’t pass emissions for a completely bullshit reason but ran and drove perfectly all the same. i just absolutely fucking hate being told what i can and can’t do with my own damn car that i pay for 100% myself. my car is my therapist and my favorite thing that i own. i’m working a dead end job with no room for promotion or growth, and coronavirus got me laid off indefinitely til the whole mess dies down. i cannot possibly be expected to pay for all that shit when they know damn well millions of people are losing their fucking jobs. it’s been a month since quarantine and i can’t really even leave my house. can’t have a social life. just feel like i have no oat he gave me his number. he walked back to the police cruiser and backed out, flashing his headlights at me to do the same. he followed me to the highway, turning off onto a side road and honking as he drove away while i got on the entrance ramp. i drove the 2 hours back home, not completely believing what had just happened and how he saved my life. i never even got his name or badge number. i got home close to 5 this morning and no one was up yet luckily. i snuck in and went to my room and slept for about 3 hours. i gave no indication to my family that i tried suicide the night before. no one knew that i went out last night. i still haven’t told them and i don’t plan to. they have no idea that i could’ve died. i called the officer’s number and left him a voicemail thanking him again. he texted me later in the day saying his offer was still valid any time. i have no idea if he had to fill out any paperwork and don’t really want to ask. everyone has at least one secret that they’ll take to their grave, and this is probably mine. it’s a long shot that he’ll read this but if he does, i don’t know what to say to him or how to thank him. his compassion saved my life. it’s crazy to think what would’ve happened if he had taken a different patrol route and hadn’t come along when he did. he deserves a promotion and to win the lottery. i owe him my life. cops get a bad rap for being arrogant, power hungry racists with itchy trigger fingers, but this particular officer represents what humanity should be like. we wouldn’t have people killing themselves if we simply stopped being assholes to each other. i don’t know if there’s a department medal for talking a suicidal person off the ledge, literally in my case, but he deserves it. i could probably call his department number and get his name and send him something in the mail. not a bad idea. godspeed officer. i’ll never forget this and how someone cared, and cared enough to actually do something about it."
adhd,anxiety,1380,"i just came to complain honestly. i’ve been trying to fall asleep for hours and i have to be up early and the fact that i have to wake up tomorrow morning stresses me out and then it makes it harder for me to sleep. i get so frustrated that people can just “go to sleep.” every time i put my phone away and close my eyes my mind just races with thoughts. sometimes anxious thoguhts, hypothetical scenarios, replaying conversations,  not even think it’s a panic attack, i can really only just describe it as just “one of those nights” and it’s torture. not to mention i’ve had like 2 different songs mentally playing while i’ve tried to write this and lost track of myself while writing this post about three times. anyways thanks for reading if u made it to the end. it’s just comforting knowing that i’m not the only one bc it genuinely feels like i’m going crazy."

bipolar,anxiety,1384,"came across this and thought they may be useful for anyone suffering from mild depression: does anyone religiously do cbt and if so did it help? **common cognitive distortions** a partial list from robert l. leahy, stephen j. f. holland, and lata k. mcginn’s [*treatment plans and interventions for depression and anxiety disorders*] (2012) 1. **mind reading** you assume that you know what people think without having sufficient evidence of their thoughts. “he thinks i’m a loser.” 2. **fortune-telling** you predict the future negatively: things will get worse, or there is danger ahead. “i’ll fail that exam,” or “i won’t get the job.” 3. **catastrophizing** you believe that what has happened or will happen will be so awful and unbearable that you won’t be able to stand i feel now,” or “my parents caused all my problems.” 10. **what if?** you keep asking a series of questions about “what if” something happens, and you fail to be satisfied with any of the answers. “yeah, but what if i get anxious?,” or “what if i can’t catch my breath?” 11. **emotional reasoning** you let your feelings guide your interpretation of reality. “i feel depressed; therefore, my marriage is not working out.” 12. **inability to disconfirm** you reject any evidence or arguments that might contradict your negative thoughts. for example, when you have the thought i’m unlovable, you reject as irrelevant any evidence that people like you. consequently, your thought cannot be refuted. “that’s not the real issue. there are deeper problems. there are other factors.”"

ptsd,depression,1412,"i have this regularly and destroyed my social life once again a while back. i pushed away all people i love and lost basically every human connection. i feel like i'd just justify my behavio me. i don't think it's ever going to be any other way, so i don't care anymore. i'm starting to think that i should stay in this totally emotionless state just to stop hurting my loved ones."

depression,bipolar,1416,"i was putting dishes in the sink this morning so i could wash them before going to work. my phone goes off in my pocket. it's my mom. my heart drops. my grandma's health has been declining for the last year and we've had a few scares where she's close to death. so, naturally i think that my grandma had passed. no, it was the sheriff. my heart drops even farther now. oh god, who is it? he says eric lastname had passed away this morning. he went for a walk and someone found him dead. at this time, i'm just in shock thinking this is some fucked up dream. eric has been my step father for the last 21 years. we butted heads from the start, but he kept me straight and pushed me to do better. i would hate to see where i would be if it weren't for eric being in my life. i could only imagine that i would be living on the streets, or dead. eric and i have receeal getting there. i'm about to head out in a few minutes to go see her. this is the worst thing that could happen now. eric was taking care of finances for my grandma since she's in hospice and their own finances. so now she'll have to take care of her house and land, plus my grandma's land. we don't expect grammy to live for another 6 months or so. so, that gives us a bit of time to think, but i know my mom is going to be devastated for quite some time. i'm ok at the moment, but i know i'm going to be pretty fucked up about this for a long time. i love that man as a father. he was someone i could look up to. someone who would give you the shirt off of his back, or meet me half way between cities to give me money we desperately needed. i miss that man. i may need to call my doctor to get my antidepressants upped. i don't deal with death well at all."
depression,anxiety,1423,"i don't know if it's because i feel they won't care, like i'm being annoying, or if i realize i simply don't want to share. i just know i do it."
adhd,anxiety,1426,"also, stop procrastinating on reddit. is there a small first step of something that you should be doing right now? go do it. wait. no. don't read ""just one more post."" go directly from this to the thing you're dreading. just do 60 seconds of something productive towards it. feel better? keep going. you got this :)"
anxiety,depression,1428,i’m afraid to try new things and afraid i actually won’t be good enough to do them. i always think people are negatively judging me for not being perfect at everything. anyone else?
none,depression,1432,i think that may be one of the saddest songs in existence. is it pathetic that that song makes me cry whenever i take the time to sit down and listen to it? it is unbelievably sad.
adhd,bipolar,1437,"it's the highest my gpa has been in my entire life. i can hardly begin to describe the combination of triumph and excitement and hope for what's to come, along with with the melancholy of what could've been, and the dread for how it might all go wrong. you guys know the feeling i'm talking about right?"
depression,anxiety,1438,"everyone says people are wired differently. some people are more shy than others, some people are bigger than others, some are smarter etc. then there are those whose propssful? some people simply can't be happy. no matter where they are, who they are with, or what they are doing they still don't want to be here. and it really fucking sucks."
none,anxiety,1446,"it's not that we lose power all the time, internet is slow, poverty, hassling, haggling, scams, the things that most people hate... it's that it has made me so goddamn cynical. i have to assume that anyone who's indian that approaches us, wants to take something from us. i talk to a man for 5 minutes and he invites us to dinner. he probably wantsy speak a word. i'm to the point where i'm about to just completely ignore any passerby who attempts to speak with us. is that too much? any advice on coping with this kind of cynicism? i can't afford not to be vigilant like this, because i feel like i'd be sacrificing safety. but i also hate not being able to give people the benefit of the doubt."
depression,anxiety,1448,"which is wack, because we're all a bunch of strangers hiding behind usernames. but this is such a common theme for me. for example, if someone passes me on the freeway, i immediately assume it's because that person is angry at me and wants to run me over. where is this line of thinking coming from? is it anxiety? i've been depressed for 13 years and this ""everybody hates me empirically"" has only surfaced in the last 1-2 years. anyone else deal with this?"
none,ptsd,1451,"i was recording the police while they were using same mouthpiece to check for *drinking under influence* during march. i felt that this is wrong to do while there is a contagious virus out there, you fucking don't know who's got it. one traffic cop sneaked up to me and held me while he called all his colleagues, 7-8 guys surrounding me. their leader screamed and yelled at much law exists and people know about it, it will make a significant difference because the police will have a sense of ""someone's watching me"" and could bring down police brutality. edit: deleted the video, it made me feel uncomfortable having it in my gallery. i had nightmares about how it could have gone more wrong, for a week. you know it's bad when police gives you ptsd."

ptsd,depression,1462,"was scrolling through twitter earlier and saw a video of two girlfriends talking and one was stroking the other’s hair and holding her hand and i just,, started crying because i ver want to touch my skin or my body in a kind way. has anyone else ever experienced something like this? sorry if i’ve done anything wrong, it’s my first time posting in this sub"
anxiety,bipolar,1463,"if you have a shift later in the day/evening do you ever just sit there, immobile, almost paralyzed to so anything before work starts? idk why but it’s like i can’t start anything else even dishes bc i’m worried it’ll go on too longaybe i’m nervous about the gig. i don’t have it often and i have to teach a huge group of people so maybe it’s that. was just wondering if anyone else had similar feelings to an activity or engagement hat takes a lot of their energy."
bipolar,depression,1468,"i didn't care to do anything this year. the only reason i bought a cake is because i have a six year old. the only reason i'm posting is because... those younger than me: you'll be 31 i am finally getting self discipline down and writing my books. i couldn't even imagine this all before. i've had the ups and downs but today, i am 31, and you'll get here one day, too."
depression,bipolar,1472,"kinda shitty advice. but i'll start with some backstory. i'm on mobile so forgive me. (this will be kinda rambly) i was diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety disorder after i checked into a psychiatric hospital a few years back, but i always felt as i grew up that something was wrong. when i went to go meet my biological mother (who is very bipolar) when i was 18 things started to click with me that i needed to figure out a way to find meaning. it didn't help that my step-mom was an abusive cunt. so overall i kinda suck at being a person.(still do) anyways, i've struggled with constantly feeling down, and also feeling a whole lotta shit i didn't really understand. because of this i turned to weed and alcohol when i was 15. went through a few phases of drinking hard, but really weed was my poison of choice(still dont think it's bad but that's for another sub). again anyways because of the plant i kinda regained a sense of what it meant to be a healthy functioning member of society, but it was  pay the rent, things get complicated with family, with work, with life. and all of it together makes me wanna opt out. but then i think of leaving him by himself to deal with it himself and what a living hell that would be. even if i cant do much, ill do what i can till i can't. because if i dont that would make me sadder than anything i can ever encounter in my life. my point is that out there there are strong, amazing, incredibly intelligent and driven people, who do this shit alone. while feeling everything. and its heart breaking. my dad spent his life trying to make me feel welcome when every fiber of my being says i don't belong on this earth. the least i can do is gtfo bed and try to do something. even if my battle that day is just to brush my teeth. so that he can see a good looking smile that he made. to make him feel just a little better. that's my part, my mission. thats what gets me up. there are people that can use your help, and you owe it to them. but that s just my opinion."
ptsd,bipolar,1473,"so long story short, recently i’ve been noticing i have more stomach troubles. vomiting, diarrhea, etc. yesterday i had another “stomach bug” but i noticed as soona man had gotten too close to me and i almost threw up in my car on the way home. does anyone else experience this? is this something i should tell my psychiatrist?"
bipolar,depression,1476,"you are climbing a mountain, it's hell, you want to give up , you push on and when you finally think you can't take another step, someone passes you on the way back down and tells you it's just 5 more minutes. a grueling ten minutes pass, you collapse on a rock and drop your pack. you see the summit. you lie on the ground for ten more minutes trying to shake out the last drops of water from the bottle into your mouth and they dribble down your face instead. you brought double the water everyone else did and it wasn't enoughiew was beautiful, you should see the view from the peak, it's amazing, so worth the trip, and you go wtf. you know night will come eventually, climbing up that mountain, never reaching the ""summit"", uncertain of how many hours you have left. only that night will come and then the struggle will end. stop making false promises that ""it will get better"". stop asking me to believe in fairytales. i don't want another false hope only to be shattered again like a glass falling to hard floor. i am so tired of picking up the pieces."
depression,anxiety,1478,"i usually dont wash or fold unless i absolutely have to, so i typically look like a mess. having folded clothes made me a little more confident when i got dressed that i could make it through today."
depression,bipolar,1482,"like the real laugh, from the heart... and its usually about something stupid but it feel so good and you stop and think of how long its been since that happened, and how you cant imagine that people are laughing and feeling like this all the time? when i get where i'm going i'm going to laugh and smile like that every day, and its going to be amazing."
bipolar,depression,1486,"i was recently pming with someone about relationships, heartbreak, and feeling broken and picked up on a shared sentiment. that our mental illnesses made us less deserving of love from healthy people. which my rational mind tells me is total bullshit, but it's still a sentiment i have to put effort into rejecting. it's no secret i've been investing serious time into online dating, but i think it's progress on my part that most of the time i don't feel like my mental illness disqualifies me from relationships with healthy people. i still feel like i'll be better understood by people who experience depression and whatnot and like my issues will be less of a burden to someone with their own struggles for me to give back to, but as i was thinking abouto more broken than any ""normie."" *how many of you have struggled to feel like it's okay to have relationships with healthy people, and of those of you who have, what if anything has helped you chip away at that feeling?* as broken as i've felt and as flawed as i've been, i've never been broken and i've never stopped being worth loving. there have been things about me that have made it harder to love me, like my former bmi of nearly 40 as a barrier to that kind of attracted attention, but even then i was sometimes shown that kind of love. **however broken you may feel and however unlovable you may feel, you are most certainly mistaken. you are complete and just as flawed as everyone else and worthy of love, however hard it may be to find that love.**"
