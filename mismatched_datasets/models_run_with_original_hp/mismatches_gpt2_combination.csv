anxiety,none,9,"is it 'selfish' to not want to celebrate birthdays and holidays hi guys, so yesterday i (23f) had my graduation and i asked my family to be there. i wanted to share this moment, but nos business and ate my food) it wasnt my day. but my sister (43) told me ( as everybody else tells me) 'dont whine. they mean well and suck it up' *tl;dr: is it sellfish?! is it really?*"
adhd,depression,11,"i know that the future is coming, but i don't believe it. **warning:** even i barely have the attention span to read this post, and i wrote it. i tried to break it up with ***~~excessive formatting.~~*** i don't think i succeeded. --- i've spent my whole life wondering why i procrastinate on things i enjoy doing. i think i've figured it out, and it's really fucking stupid. intellectually, i know that the future is a real thing. there is, in fact, a time other than now. i *know* that. but i don't *believe* it. my brain thinks time is a myth and there's no such thing as tomorrow. no matter how many times tomorrow comes, it refuses to believe that it will happen again. it's like i think the world is going to end in 15 minutes. and if the future doesn't exist, future happiness can't exist either. i should be writing right now. i enjoy writing. but i'm not currently writing, so the happiness i would derive from writing is obviously fake. ~*obviously*~. i do this shit with everything. writing, reading, talking to friends, going to the gym, throwing the ball for my dog, even playing a fucking video game. i like all those things, but at this precise moment i'm not experiencing pleasure derived from them, so it clearly can't be real. instant gratification is the only gratification i understand. if it doesn't make me happy in the next .04 seconds, it's never going to, right? that's why i spend hours dicking around on the inter understand how i, the conscious person, and my brain, the subconscious asshole who's actually got the reins, can disagree on something. she doesn't get the difference between *knowing* and *believing*. and i don't get why she doesn't get it. hasn't she ever had to fight a part of herself? do normal people never feel like their brain is a separate entity that they have to fight for control? the constant struggle between your innate-but-baseless beliefs and your rationality seems like such a fundamental part of being a person. is it really not a thing for her, or am i just explaining it poorly? the part of me that tells me ""the future isn't real"" is the same part of me that screams ""you're gonna die"" every time i see a moth. both statements are wrong, and i know full well they're wrong, but that doesn't change anything. my heart rate still triples like the moth is an acid-spitting honey badger. i still fuck around like i'm frozen in time. i've been banging my head against this wall my entire goddamn life and made minimal progress. i don't think i'm making any progress now. i have no idea where to even start. i guess the moral of this rambling bitchfest is that adhd is really, really dumb. --- **tl;dr**: my adhd thinks the future is fake. i know the future is real, but i'm not in charge. i can't get started on things i enjoy because the enjoyment is in the future, which doesn't exist to me. the fuck am i supposed to do?"
bipolar,anxiety,14,"don't let others define your illness! 35(m), recently divorced and lost my job on monday due to a nervous breakdown. i'm in the first week of 30 day outpatient treatment program, seeing the psychiatrist tues. ex (43f) didn't believe my need for mental health care and we got in plenty of fights over it throughout our 8 years. the irony is that she's a nurseown friends and it feels like a victory to have the opportunity to see a therapist 3x a week after being told for years that i wasn't permitted or the relationship would suffer or end. i spend lots of time right now laying on my back staring at the ceiling while ugly crying. i've read a bunch of your stories and i think you're all very strong. much respect."
adhd,depression,26,"incredibly bored with life i don't know how to best explain this feeling i have all the time, but extreme boredom comes kinda close. dissatisfaction with everything. i often hate my life so much, because i feel li more exciting things i just feel like i could might as well be dead. i'm so bored, so disappointed, so unmotivated, that lying down and just dying seems like a good alternative. what do i even do about this? help."
bipolar,anxiety,29,"just sharing my recent talk with my doctor monthly appointment with my doctor again. so i was a little worried about feeling this weird ""not caring"" on some things that i usually do. so i brought it up when he asked, is there anything yo bad? i replied, that's the issue, i don't know. i'm not sure if it is good or bad. i said maybe imm just tired of being stressed. he smiled and i was surprised when he said, then it's good that you are becoming resilient to daily stress."

bipolar,depression,35,"i'm in a rough patch, and it really hurts. i've been depressed for two months now, and panic attacks and prolonged crying jags from this week that have left me very depleted. this time around i'm feeling just so isolated. all of my close friends are in relationships, so they don't have much time to give me extra support. i understand that i can't be a priority for my friends and family all of the time, but a text checking that i'm ok every onci've been practicing piano and reading, and today i even cooked for myself; but i'm just so tired. life is gray right now and it's hard, and trying to bring myself out of this depression feels almost impossible. i know it'll pass...i'm just not sure when, and waiting for it to lift is painful. i want my life back, dammit. sorry for the length and self-pitying nature of this post; i just needed to get this off my chest. thanks for reading &lt;3"
ptsd,bipolar,37,no one will give me my meds i've seen three different doctors and none of them will give me my meds. i'm literally getting to the point i will just buy the pills off the internet and risk going to prison just to function. they keep trying to tell me there are other meds that help that aren't addictive. why do they keep telling me this fucking lie and why the fuck do they believe it!!! i guess i'll just drink to function because that's what these people fucking want. i want to strangle these fucking doctors.
adhd,bipolar,48,"arguments/debates are the bane of my existence. every time i get into an argument/ debate i’m either a second away from crying or a second away from an angry outburst. it’s so hard to keep my cool and as a result... i learned to stop talking/ people ple like shit for the rest of the day because i feel like i’ve been rejected. everytime i feel rejected i suddenly think everyone is going to abandon me, and i get stuck in that feeling. i’m learning slowly and taking my time... but god does this shit suck!"

ptsd,depression,55,"does it ever get better? i don't mean for this to be a huge downer, i've just been stuck in this rumination for a while now. even on my best days i feel disconnected and never able to fully live in the moment. i'm worrying about the past or future, i'm overthinking a million different moments and possibilities at once. ior 5 am. idk. i just feel like everyone is behind a glass wall can't cross. people are graduating and marrying and forming families and i just feel perpetually lost despite my efforts to get better. i think i just need a bit of hope. i'm trying though, i really am. i'm no longer on rock bottom but it's all just difficult."
depression,bipolar,63,"you guys ever feel like self loathing is addicting i feel like i almost get some weird sense of satisfaction when i'm in a cycle of self loathing. i don't feel happy during it, but there's something addicting about having that nasty inner crits continue, and any resistance to it feels straining and requires a lot of mental effort. tl;dr anyone else feel a sense of catharsis when you have a spiral of negative thoughts of yourself? any tips for getting out of that cycle of thoughts?"
depression,ptsd,64,i got raped twice and get bullied about it. i started to cry myself into sleep again for a week now and i don't know what to do anymore [context in the comments] i triedly delete it if that is the case. and apologize for losing myself in writing all that down. it actually kinda helped me just to write it down and get it off my shoulders!
anxiety,depression,76,"staring down the barrel of my 30th birthday and have never been in a relationship. all hope is now gone. so the title sums it up. i'm almost 28, all my friends are engaged, married or have a clatter of children. i have never even had a boyfriend in my life. i've had ""friend with benefits"" who in reality were not friends and have not benefitted me. i can see now i was used a practice girl before they moved onto women they actually care about. i have social anxiety and hate myself so expect others to hate me too. things like eye contact are very difficult. i urage to say ""i love you"" for the first time in my life, he dumped me before i got that far. i'm not angry, i don't blame him, he just didn't feel the same way i do. it's left me absolutely broken. i believe im not good enough for anyone and don't see the point in going on anymore. i just go through the motions every day without feeling anything. i am on meds and see a doctor regularly but nothing helps. i tried counselling and could not talk. i have a history involving suicide and sexual assault and so trust is hard for me. i don't know where to go from here."
adhd,bipolar,82,"i just want to say thank you to all of the subscribers of this subreddit. as emotional as it sounds, i never felt understood until i found you guys. seriously. i never realized other people struggled with as many of the same things that i struggle with. finding this community helped me realize that i'm not alone, and helped me better understand my mental illness. i am so grateful."
adhd,depression,83,"don't you hate it when you lose track of what you were daydreaming about and can't get back to it often times i'll get distracted from my thoughts either by external influences or just another idea coming in, and then i have to spend a good 5 minutes trying to work out what i was thinking about again."
bipolar,adhd,90,"my doctor gave me validation today and an eight month hiatus two months ago i went to my psychiatrist after being stable for a year and asked her for adderall. i made a total fool of myself. what i didn't realize is that i was on a downward spiral. all of my responsibilities have been unmanageable but i didn't realize it. slowly but surely, my mental health declined until it was affecting me physically. i was having acidgreed with me. she told me she knew from experience that a person who has been stable asking for a control is a sign they're slipping. she said she knows how hard i work and it's understandable that i need a time out. my doctor gave me eight months, minimum. she will let me have up to 12 months if i need it. i'm going to use this time to completely overhaul my life and get help. it just feels so damn good to be validated."
anxiety,adhd,93,"does anyone have trouble sitting still and have to occupy yourself? i can't sit still when i get my eyebrows done, and when i'm in class i usually doodle to focus. i pay attention very well in school regardless of that, and drawing helps me focus."
depression,bipolar,96,"failed 2 classes. now i’m on academic suspension. i really let it get out of hand this time folks. i got an email today saying i’m being excluded from my academics (meaning won’t be able to go to class...) because i didn’t pass 2 of my classes. so now, my choices are 1. talk to the dean to see if i qualify for a cancellation of exclusion, 2. get suspended, or 3e to the absolute limit. i’m not sure if i’ll be able to take it. i can’t live with my parents again. my dad doesn’t believe in mental illness whatever that means. thinking about this situation makes me hate everything. im so done with life. i don’t know why i even try anymore. i knew i wasn’t cut out for college and i might as well give up and go waitress again"
ptsd,anxiety,97,"pretty extreme anxiety lately. i feel completely trapped in my own head. i've had that ""chair is about to fall backward"" feeling day in and day out for like three weeks now. it's becoming exhausting. i feel like a thousand screaming emotions are trapped behind a stone exterior. i can't cry or yell or write. i can't express anown symptoms most of the time, it's just particularly bad right now and trying to out-logic my emotions is just overwhelming sometimes. right now is one of those times. you guys are my people and i guess i'm not really looking for solutions, just someone to remind me that it will pass and maybe offer up some tips on self-care."
ptsd,anxiety,101,"how do i go from coping to healing? i've been having more panic attacks triggered by loud, sharp sounds, including today where a neighbor's fire alarm put me so on edge and panic-attacky that even after some help from my partner i'm still having a little trouble sleeping. i'm really really tired of just coping, of just n the brain, but is there at least some way that i can feel better, that i can feel less anxiety, that i can exist without having so many of my coping methods? i mean, i also deal with anxiety for other reasons, and that also hasn't been getting better, but if i could at least take this on separately it would help a bit."

anxiety,ptsd,112,"wife had panic attack in the theater and passed out. my wife passed out from a panic attack yesterday in the theatre while we were watching *a quiet place*. i was so scared and didn't know what to do. about an hour into the movie, there's a scene where someone steps on a nail. it wasn't even very gory, but i guess it triggered some bad memories for her. a few seconds after that scene, my wife's arm started twitching kind of like a seizure. at the same time, she started making sounds like she was snoring or maybe choking. when i looked at her, her head was lolled to the side and her eyes were closed. not realizing what was happening, i nudged her a bit, thinking she had fallen asleep. when her head rolled to the other side and there wasn't any other response my concern sky-rocketed. i took her head in my hands and gently shook her a little bit trying to wake her up. her eyes partially opened, and i could see her pupils were looking up like when you roll your eyes. there was no other response. i tilted her head forward and the ""snoring"" sound stopped, but she was still unconscious. at this point,d her and help her feel safe. i tried to just hold her and comfort her. after about a half hour she was doing better. i felt so helpless when she was unconscious. it's very scary when you suddenly realize your loved one is having a medical emergency. later in the evening, she revealed to me that when she was a teenager, she had an abusive boyfriend that would rape her, cut her with a scalpel, and poke her with needles. sick stuff like that i guess. she wouldn't say much more about it than that. i am angry. not at her, but at the thought some sicko did this to her. and i hurt. i grieve that she has experienced something so traumatic it causes this type of thing. she agreed we will get her into some therapy. she needs healing that i never knew she needed. i also know this isn't about me, but i feel a bit hurt this is just now coming out. we've been married about 5 years, and i never knew this stuff. what else don't i know? i don't know what type of advice i'm looking for. how can i be there for her? how can i help? what do i do if this happens again? did i do the right thing both during and after?"
ptsd,bipolar,118,i use cheap bluetooth led lights to help regulate sleep. it is amazing. i bought a couple of bluetooth led lights from homedepot for around $15 each. through their app i setup 'schedules' that t is almost off. i still have plenty of nights of insomnia but it has helped me create a better routine and it helps so much that it happens automatically. anyone else tried something like this?
depression,anxiety,120,"i washed and folded my laundry today. i usually dont wash or fold unless i absolutely have to, so i typically look like a mess. having folded clothes made me a little more confident when i got dressed that i could make it through today."
ptsd,anxiety,129,"something feels wrong. like it says, something feels wrong. i can taste in my mouth that something isn't right. it's as if i'm looking at everything through a different light, like my ms being screamed throughout my head. i can feel in my chest that something is wrong, it's not anxiety, it's my heart pumping so loud. it feels like something very bad is about to happen."
ptsd,depression,131,"i cried several times today cw: suicide, violence, law enforcement, child abuse... i cried on my way to work after i bought my coffee. i saw the sunrise and started crying because i thought about the people i couldn't save because i wasn't good enough, they won't get to live and see a sunrise. or enjoy a coffee in the morning. that hurt (i worked with certain organizations i can't name for obvious reasons tracking human traffickers for some context. anyone in law enforcement, or first responders probably know you can't sdrunk last night too. i cried at home because i just needed to. i think i just needed a day but i had meetings. ive been feeling so helpless that i can't even bother to feed myself, ive lost so much weight. i think i want to die but i have friends that have committed suicide too. and i don't want to put my friends through the pain i felt. today was a bad day and i wanted to bitch about it, welcome to my shit show ladies and gentlemen. i'm weak now, i don't have any more mental fortitude left. i hope your day was better :)"
anxiety,depression,132,is anyone else tired of being tired? i feel drained and exhausted. every day. even when i exercise. i'm so lonely but no one ever hangs out with me or talks with me. most of my friends left and now i'm back to where i started. :/ i feel guilty to and idk why. i've never experienced this type of sadness before
depression,anxiety,137,"does anyone else feel worse just seeing people who have passions? everyday in high school i see people who can be engaged in certain classes and discussions out of what seems like interest. sometimes i see or hear about a student who went above and beyond on something. or, at the very least, i notice people who can do work and study for tests reasonably ahead of time. every time i see one of these tnd don't feel remotely interested in any of them. college is coming next year, and i have no idea what i'm going to do, or if i even have the motivation to make it through. it's been difficult enough pretending like i care in high school. any kind of work is just a massive mental chore to get through. if it weren't for my massive anxiety and fear of falling out, i probably wouldn't get anything done."
ptsd,anxiety,140,i hate people touching me ive come to the situation where i have a brand new partner who wants to hold my hand and this is coming to a head for me again. the  moment the hand holding gets to hand rubbing i cry again and so on. im 19 what do you think i should do? understandably all of my relationships are very short
adhd,anxiety,143,"i got a 3.48 gpa over my last five college classes!!! it's the highest my gpa has been in my entire life. i can hardly begin to describe the combination of triumph and excitement and hope for what's to come, along with with the melancholy of what could've been, and the dread for how it might all go wrong. you guys know the feeling i'm talking about right?"
ptsd,adhd,151,"do you internalize everything or take it out on others? i tend to internalize everything, i close up and shut down a lot. i don't really get angry at others, just with myself. it really helps for me to talk about it because it seems like i can get rid of some of the things that i've internalized."
ptsd,anxiety,153,"i hate it when people treat it like i’m having a tantrum it’s so invalidating and patronizing. i’m a goddamn adult i have a job and pay taxes, if i don’t want to hear you say his name or talk about him so casually when you don’t think i’m listening then buck the fuck up and learn a little respect."
adhd,anxiety,175,my life feels like i'm constantly trying to over-come one hurdle after another. wake up. be anxious about something. forget to do something. lose something joke has an element of truth in it. become hyper-sensitive. nearly break down into tears. debate suicide. wonder why my referral is taking so fucking long.

adhd,bipolar,342,"tips on regulating emotions, specifically the ""cringe"" feeling? you know how sometimes you'll just remember something in the past you did and cringe at yourself and its like, kinda physically painful? that's the feeling i'm talking about. for most people it just kinda comes and goes and they are fine bearing it for a moment, however i seem to either be hypersensitive to the feeling or just really bad at regulating it (probably a bit of both tbh), as half the time ""i wanna punch myself"" doesn't stop at just being a descriptor of how and feel and ends up being a bit of how i cope with it til it passes :/ i'll end up hitting myself on my leg or arm or something or punching a nearby wall as a way to relieve the tension, never hard enough to leave a lasting mark but often enough to be worrisome. i know it's not healthy but i don't know wh perform in any way i'll end up having a panic attack, yet i pretty much never actively avoid possible triggers and even signed up for my school's improv and dance clubs completely out of my own freewill (actually participating, however, is a different matter). basically, never happens to me lol. does anyone have any advice on better ways to cope with the cringe feelings, or with just emotional regulation in general? i'm on ritalin ir rn and while it does seem to help a bit, the problem is still very present, especially later in the evening or at night where i'm more tired and the meds have worn off. **tl;dr i have general emotional regulation problems and specifically always end up coping with ""cringe"" feelings with self harm. does anyone have advice on healthier ways to cope or other general help with emotional regulation?** thanks!"

bipolar,anxiety,602,"""1) nothing makes you happy/all you do is complain/2) everytime we talk, there's conflict, so i'm anxious whenever we speak/ 3) every time you talk, you complain."" i'm afraid of being this unhappy person who pushes people away. anyone hear else? 3 long stories; tldr at the bottom. so in the title, within quotation marks, are what i've heard from people i spent the most time with. 1) my mom, 2) a now-ex boyfriend, and 3) a former friend. 1) my mom kinda blew up in the parking lot of a hospital. the doctor said i didn't need a cough pill for my infection, and would be fine with only the prescription she gave me, and then my mom asked if she could prescribe me with a cough syrup. the doctor agreed to prescribe a strong cough syrup, and i asked if i don't need a cough pill, ""do i need cough syrup?"" the doctor said no, but said ""the medicines won't react with one another,"" and ""if you want a cough syrup, i can prescribe one."" *but i don't.* my cough won't go away (respitory infection) until the steroids kick in, but it will go away. i don't like taking meds i don't need. i'm defensive about this, because every time i have respitory issues, my mom asks the doc for a cough syrup ""for my own good"" and i feel like shit bc it's got some depressive drug in it, and i feel ultra sluggish the morning after i take it. i don't need it so i'm adverse to taking it. my mom says it's ridiculous that i have a cough and won't take a cough syrup, when no cough syrup was prescribed or suggested. the steroids will take it's course. but mothers will be mothers. i just hate taking drugs i don't actually need. (and i'm 18 so i'd think the doctor would have asked me first. guess not.) anyway she called me ungrateful and wouldn't let me speak and i dunno. it hit me. she said: ""i'm better off dead than i am alive to you, because nothing i do as your mother makes you happy."" i wanted to shoot myself in the mouth right there and then, ngl. i know that isn't the (logical) answer to this, but she isn't the only one who's said stuff like this. 2) my ldr boyfriend of two years broke up with me last night. he says he doesn't feel like he can talk to me, because he says offhanded things, and for a while, i didn't address them until months later (which is toxic). and now he feels that he'll fuck up no matter what he does, so what's the point. in the past i've addressed things as they came up and he either made fun of me, got super defensive, or asked ""so what's the problem?"". for example: he didn't speak to me for long periods of time. for like. a year. cancelled majority of skype dates at the last second. i said that i knew he has other obligations, but that still felt a bit emotionally neglected. (being left on read for days and sometimes weeks, not hearing from him for months, reading an ""i love you, too"" from him was rare. i felt like he didn't like me.) but he said that i had no reason to believe that. he had a roommate who made me cry, and he didn't defend me. even if i say that i didn't appreciate a comment, he would just join him. of course, he didn't mean to be rude, and of course he didn't mean to overlook my crying, didn't mean to misunderstand me. but he refused to buy earbuds because of his ""indispoable income"" (even if he went out to drink once a month). which gave his roommate ammo to be a bully. so i mailed my then-bf earbuds and he lost them. it felt as if he didn't put any effort into the relationship, and was justifying himself. when i asked if he wanted to break up, he sounded surprised and confused as to why. said that he loves me. i wasn't angry, just hurt and confused with all the mixed messages. but i said i believed him and ignored my gut. plus, on holidays, he drives six hundred miles in one go to visit me (and his family. so contrary to what he says, i'm not the only reason he comes to the city i live in.) but he said ""you think i wanna see my family? barely anyone there wants to see me. i'md avoiding me, too. avoiding everyone. got in a real bad funk. said uncalled for comments to me and to other people. i understand how depression can be; but that doesn't excuse her from being mean. from playing rough and with scissors (as a seventeen year old). from going out of her way to patronize people. but she put on her snapchat story her suicidal thoughts, talking about how everyone she knows is against her. so i swiped up, let her know that i apologize if i wronged her, and that i want her to be okay. that i don't think anyone is against her. that i am here if she needs to talk. she said that i can't make her pity me, and i was baffled. that she doesn't have the energy for my bullshit. (yikes.) that i shouldn't play nice if i don't feel nicely about a person. (still don't know what's she was talking about but it was childish. but still yikes.) and then she said all i do is complain about my family problems and boyfriend and do nothing to fix it. (that was when i said ""good to know,"" and blocked her. hehe.) it's so funny that she *asked me* what's wrong, didn't accept ""nothing"" for an answer, and then secretly hated when i was open and honest. i thought she was my friend. but i guess only therapists are meant to hear your problems. anyway. i digress. days after i blocked her, she came around me in person. went out of her way to sit next to me. acted fearful, as if i would reject her. took every single chance she got to be overly nice. for example: i was presenting and the class (of 13 people) was talking over me. she stood up, cupped both hands over her mouth, and projected: ""everyone! chris is talking! it is important to hear what they say, so that they can finish their presentation!"" sat down, then grinned at me. the class had the same weirded-out expression as i did. like. ugh. that was so artificial that it hurt me. i have a floridan friend who i tell some of these situations with, and he says it sounds like the other person has some unsolved problems of their own. my therapist said the same thing about all three scenarios. that nothing i complain about is like. ""i'm so sad my dad got me a blue car. i wanted a red one."" y'know? like the problems that bother me are literally ""so i'm homeless and don't know where i'm sleeping tonight "" or ""i got 27 spider bites in my sleep"" or ""my mom is threatening to kick me out and i'm an unemployed student"" or something that can't be given advice, because it's totally out of anyone's control. like when my car got totalled and i kept having flashbacks about the crash throughout the day. i couldn't sleep at night. for weeks. or when three of my classmates died. or when i was in a sexually abusive relationship for six months, got assaulted everyday on school grounds, and didn't tell anyone for eight months. i have flashbacks and awful dreams about *that* one to this day. but i don't say anything until someone asks me what's wrong. and even if they do, i'm reluctant to say so. bc none of this can be hugged better. it's heavy. it's uncomfortable and nobody wants to hear it. those are the only things that get to me. those are the things i go to therapy for. but my therapist doesn't believe in dwelling on (talking about) past traumas and griefs. i don't know what anyone wants me to do anymore. do i just let go of *everything*? i do not exagerrate; these things happened in the same twelve months. i'm not trying to excuse my complaints, but, yikes. i don't know what to make of any of this. anyway. tldr: nobody i open up to stick around. are all of these situations like. situations where both parties have made acceptable mistakes in handling their situation? or am i this unhappy person who makes people miserable because i complain so much? am i ungrateful? am i being crazy for saying the things i do? does anyone else hear statements like these from people who see you the most? it's times like these that makes self destructive behavior so easy."
adhd,anxiety,616,"two words.. noise. sensitivity. fuck. i can't filter out certain noises and it makes my head feel likes it's gonna explode. it makes me really anxious. i ant to rip my hair out. noise sensitivty feels like an itch i can't scratch. if this happens to you guys, what do you do to help it? i'm quickly going mad!"
anxiety,ptsd,617,"i attended a therapy appointment today i took the first step. i’ve been struggling so much for the past few months. it’s gotten to the point that i’m barely sleeping and when i do, i have insane nightmares. a couple weeks ago i booked a therapy appointment and it was today. i stood outside the building and came very close to just leaving because the idea of opeg to say is; if you’re wondering if you should start looking for a therapist, do it. if you’ve found a therapist that seems interesting but you’re not sure if you should reach out, do it. if you’ve made an appointment but you’re not sure if you should attend, attend it. and if you’re standing outside wondering if you should go in, go in. it will help, i promise."
adhd,depression,621,"""are you retarded?"" apologies for the use of that word in this post, for those who might be sensitive to it. *edit again* copy/pasting a comment to another user: where i'm from people use it as a slur toward the autism community. i'm actually not even sure it's just where i'm from - i see it all over the internet too. i don't personally think they're synonymous but since i witness ""autistic"" and ""retarded"" being used in the same sentence by shitty people all the time, i only wanted to be clear that i don't feel the same way and that i don't want to hurt anyone with my post :( that's why i had previously written that i don't use that word, nor would i ever call somngelist. but when i argue with my boyfriend i can barely remember what i've just said...i can't always remember how the argument even started. i get really flustered and then that gets worse. all i seem to hear is ""you're wrong."" i'm not always good at getting across what i mean the first time, either. so in frustration last night, my boyfriend asked me ""are you retarded?"" and it honestly hurt me a bit. i know some of you have had people ask you that. you start giving the question some thought because you feel you can't do anything right, ever. i'm not sure why i'm making this post...just feeling down in general. fucks with me every time, when someone asks me that."
adhd,bipolar,623,not wanting to be a problem sometimes makes things worse. was anyone else reminded of what a burden and a distraction they were to the point that now they go to moronic lengths not to inconvenience anyone? i often do this and it always makes things worse. any coping strategies?

adhd,anxiety,703,"my boyfriend asked me if i ever just think about stuff. he observed that i’m always on my phone or reading or listening to music or watching television or working onng something because if i don’t direct that mental energy somehow, it turns into intrusive thoughts, anxiety, or self-destructive tendencies. stimulation is required."

bipolar,adhd,771,"forgetting how to speak correctly, or at all. i'm just curious to see if this happens to anyone else; the title is pretty self explanatory. (tl;dr at bottom) i don't mean like i'm ""out of it"" or even just fatigued for the day and my brain loses its train of thought one too many times. i feel like that happens to everyone at least once in a while (including myself). i mean like it takes an insane amount of mental energy for me to say a sentence from start to finish correctly, usually takes me a few tries to do so. so to say to speak, or how to speak in general. anyone else have similar experiences? tl;dr: does anyone sometimes find their speech to be very impaired, like you feel as if you forgot how to speak at all? maybe due to an episode, personal issues, both, etc? edit: thank you so much everyone who replied to this post, sharing your experiences and such. one of my biggest insecurities is my speech (due to the issue mentioned in this post) and it's so comforting to have so much nice, supportive feedback and to know i'm not alone on this :)"
bipolar,anxiety,794,"was diagnosed yesterday as type ii, and now things make sense, but are also scary? so i have known for a long time i have suffered from depression and anxiety. i mean if you check my posts history you can see that. i find myself frequently depressed, to the point of wanting to just end things (however won't for a myriad of reasons). i also find myself anxious beyond belief about certain things. i was told for years that i had both depression and anxiety. nothing more, nothing less. i have had manic episodes, and when i am on go, i am on go, but i am good at looking stoic and hologist has never sat me down and given me exams or anything but has suggested it for years. my therapist even was on the boarder about it for a while. i am sure my mom has it too, albeit far more showing? so yeah, here we are! rather here i am in my early 30s and finally things click. however, it is scary. like i don't know what comes next? will this diagnosis impact my life negatively and adversely? will i have to disclose it, or hide it from my job? i don't know. it is ironically depressing in of it self. but we shall see what the future holds. anyway, thanks for reading!"

anxiety,depression,863,"recently i've been diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses that have led to me being fired from my job. my doctor and counselor have me listed as extreme anxiety and depression, early childhood ptsd, bi polar, borderline personality disorder. it's a relief to have an answer to what my problems are. this has been an on going problem my whole adult life. my first job, i had reasons for being depressed. i dropped out of school, parents were divorcing and i didn't have a stable housing situation, i was falling behind and depressed, full of anger and anxiety. i didn't want to call myself weak though and admit i had a problem, so i attempted to self medicate by escaping reality. i skateboarded, played video games, drank, smoked weed, partied, did everything i could to feel numb. 5 years later, because i didn't seek help or medicationn test, then i can finish my sdi application. my point to all this is i would be homeless and probably dead without her. she has saved my ass countless times over the years,having a mental illness makes holding a job so fucking difficult, i've lost at least 6 jobs since being with her. i have nothing but respect and love for her to be putting up with all this, while we are both still fairly young (i'm 24, she's 21 later this year) i wish her parents understood mental illness, but it's kind of a taboo in her family so we keep things as vague as possible. i just hope that i get through to disability services and can make an income that way, to relieve some stress from her life. she put off school for me from the very beginning, the least i can do is help her get through school. sorry about the rant. i hope everyone has a great day."

anxiety,bipolar,881,"i’m sorry if this gets asked a lot but... does anyone else feel too “normal” to not have a mental illness but not “crazy” enough to actually have one? i think about this a little more than i should... and then i keep saying “you have nothing wrong with you! your parents were right, you’re just faking it for the attention! and then think about that until you cry? bothers me."
ptsd,depression,887,"my therapist has cancer just, come on, universe! really? this therapist saved my life, i owe everything to her, but now i have to watch her go through chemo and radiation completeds because the chemo fucks with her brain. i'm not looking for sympathy or advice, just a rant because it feels like the one thing in the whole world that i can't discuss with her."
bipolar,depression,891,being attracted to your therapist is weird it’s only because he’s a decent looking dude who’s fulfilling my current emotional needs by being supportive and understanding. since that’s his job haha. it’s like beer goggles but with depression.
ptsd,depression,895,"dae get tired of not being able to trust anything or anyone? i had a few very traumatic events happen to me over the course of about 3 years. as a result, i really don’t trust in anything or anyone anymore. i managed to get married and really do trust my partner, but not anyone else. i r use what i’ve been through to harm me. it gets really exhausting because i’m really lonely here since i don’t know anybody which exacerbates my depression. it’s like, i have the desire to try and make friends but what i’ve been through just won’t let me. it’s such an isolating feeling."

bipolar,adhd,903,"no cure someone reminded me the other day that there’s no cure for this disorder. as someone with a family history of it and someone who has been struggling with it most of my life, i objectively knew that, but i realized that this whole time i’ve been trying to change my medicine for almost a year, my mind has been hopeful for a cure. i have been wanting to cure it, not treat it, but actually be rid of it forever. wow. remembering that there’s no cure really hurts a lot and makes me kinda hopeless."
depression,anxiety,911,anyone else so tired all the time? i find that through it all the worst part is just being so tired all the time. like sure sometimes i’m in a lot of pain but basic tasks are always hard and i just want to be in bed. anyone else and any advice?

adhd,anxiety,1160,"what learned helplessness is like just in case anyone isn't aware of what learned helplessness feels like, and as a warning to people not to keep trying the same thing over and over, i've written the following. i will use the term ""brain"" to refer to the unconscious, impulsive parts of the brain, the parts that aren't ""you"", and ""you"" to refer to your conscious experience and rational brain. (disclaimer, this is only my experience, i don't know what other people's experiences are.) --- imagine walking around, going through life, except you don't decide what you do. your brain decides everything for you and you have no say. it wants to play video games, so you play video games. that isn't to say you don't fight it, but on those occasions that you do you either are simply unable to do anything, or every frustration with yourself for every past failure floods upon you, washing your willpower away in a tidal wave of anxiety. you quickly learn the only way to fight is to not fight at all. --- now, imagine somebody calmly tells you, ""i know it's hard, but you really need to just get up and do it. i have no magic bullet unfortunately."" this is nice, they know that you have a hard time ""just doing it"" but at this point there's no way around it, it just needs to be done. you wholeheartedly agree with them, and feel like the ultimate solution _is_ to ""just do it"". your brain however immediately reminds you how ""it's never worked before, so why will it work now?"" this isn't just a small voice, it is backed by the combined anxiety of every failure and inadequacy you have ever had. --- i'll attempt to explain what lies behind this sense of hopelessness: this sense of hopelessness, in its simplest form, is the feeling that ""it's never worked, so why would it change?"" however, it goes deeper than that. the following is the main thought process: - according to other people you just need to try hard enough to solve the problem - you feel ""i just don't care anymore"" ( ditto ) - ""i hate myself"" (when i metaphorically close my eyes, cover my ears, and run from what i need to do yelling ""lalalalalalalala"", also when i am sitting doing something i enjoy and remember what i'm supposed to be doing) - ""i just can't."" (when i try to calm myself or when i'm lying in a fetal position on the bed, spiraling deeper into depression) - ""i just want the world to go away"" (this feeling makes me realize why some people kill themselves. i fortunately just retreat to my bed or some form of entertainment that allows my brain to shut off temporarily) --- i'm not saying this is permanent problem, or that there aren't any solutions, just that it's incredibly difficult, more difficult than i feel most anyone can imagine. it's the torture of hopelessness, with the frustration of fully knowing with your rational brain that hope itself is all that is needed to solve the problem, yet finding that hope hopelessly far away. please, everyone. think before you tell someone to ""just try."" they may have forgotten how to. --- edit: some people may say that you just need to build in systems, and i agree that that is a good solution, but at least for me, i've tried so many of my own systems that even trying to talk with it causes my brain to lock up with anxiety. likely because it forces me to confront all my past failures, which further discourages me from trying. i'd still love to hear any advice people have though. --- tl;dr; learned helplessness isn't thinking you are helpless, it is feeling that you've forgotten how to try. if you really wanted to try it would have worked, since people say to just try, so you must not really _want_ to try, so you begin to instead want to want to try. in addition, confronting it in any way brings with it all the anxiety of every past failure, meaning that often, instead of doing something you often fail to do you just close your eyes and hope it'll go away."

depression,bipolar,1224,"if you feel shitty, help someone else not feel shitty. kinda shitty advice. but i'll start with some backstory. i'm on mobile so forgive me. (this will be kinda rambly) i was diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety disorder after i checked into a psychiatric hospital a few years back, but i always felt as i grew up that something was wrong. when i went to go meet my biological mother (who is very bipolar) when i was 18 things started to click with me that i needed to figure out a way to find meaning. it didn't help that my step-mom was an abusive cunt. so overall i kinda suck at being a person.(still do) anyways, i've struggled with constantly feeling down, and also feeling a whole lotta shit i didn't really understand. because of this i turned to weed and alcohol when i was 15. went through a few phases of drinking hard, but really weed was my poison of choice(still dont think it's bad but that's for another sub). again anyways because of the plant i kinda regained a sense of what it meant to be a healthy funcnt know how we'll pay the rent, things get complicated with family, with work, with life. and all of it together makes me wanna opt out. but then i think of leaving him by himself to deal with it himself and what a living hell that would be. even if i cant do much, ill do what i can till i can't. because if i dont that would make me sadder than anything i can ever encounter in my life. my point is that out there there are strong, amazing, incredibly intelligent and driven people, who do this shit alone. while feeling everything. and its heart breaking. my dad spent his life trying to make me feel welcome when every fiber of my being says i don't belong on this earth. the least i can do is gtfo bed and try to do something. even if my battle that day is just to brush my teeth. so that he can see a good looking smile that he made. to make him feel just a little better. that's my part, my mission. thats what gets me up. there are people that can use your help, and you owe it to them. but that s just my opinion."
