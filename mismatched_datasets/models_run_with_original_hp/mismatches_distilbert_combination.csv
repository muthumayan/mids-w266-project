anxiety,depression,8,"got a dental cleaning for the first time in years, just wanted to share i feel so proud of myself. after having severe dental phobia and avoiding cleanings for years, a little tooth chipt i said yes. it wasn't bad at all, and this dentist is honestly one of the nicest people i've met in my life. i'm literally looking forward to my followup. i feel pretty proud of myself."
bipolar,adhd,11,"i can really use some encouragement right now. my doctor recently decided that she thought i was stable enough to start treating my adhd on top of my bp1. she warned me that the medicine could cause me to have a bad reaction and potentially lead to another psychotic episode or something. she started me on a low dose of vyvance but i didn't feel like it was doing anything and i've gradually gone up to the maximum dose. i've been pretty messed up for about a week now though. i also have pretty bad social anxiety and i think the meds are making me manic or mixed manic. i've been very disconnected from other people., paranoid and socially withdrawn. i havnt left my appr but i'm afraid because i don't want to get admitted again. she's a new doctor and i don't know how she is about this sort of thing. my last dr seemed like he wanted to try and have me admitted ""for observation"" all the time, even when he wanted to try me on new medicine. that's bullshit though because hospitals are safe places where they remove the stress of the outside world. how can they observe if a medicine is working or not if there aren't any factors at play that would cause an episode. i don't know what to do. i won't go in for an unscheduled appointment. the last time i went to an unscheduled appointment for issues i ended up being admitted against my will"
depression,ptsd,12,"am i alone in thinking that there are a lot of creepy, unethical, and just plain weird therapists out there? this field needs higher barriers of entry and more active policing among its members. people always say ""see a therapist!"" but man, there are to it that says ""warning: therapists are often dangerously unethical and creepy. be careful."" of course what ""see a therapist!"" really means is ""stop bothering me with your problems, i'm trying to watch netflix in my pajamas."" such is life, eh? /rant"
adhd,bipolar,28,"i spent the entire day designing business cards for a business i don't have. i mean it was obviously an incredibly productive day. i had a good night's rest, meds, and caffeine on board for the potent triple-threat... that i failed to aim at schoolwork and cleaning the apartment. *balls.* at least i remembered to eat lunch."
anxiety,adhd,30,"succes! i passed my english class, the first thing i've completed in 7 years! posting this is extremely nerve-wracking, but hey, i'm doing it! oh. my. god. i actually did it you guys! 6 months ago my psychologist convinced me t it's been 7+ years since i finished school, and this is the only thing i have accomplished since then. it was without a doubt hard and it felt impossible at times, but i'm so proud of myself now - something that rarely happens."
depression,anxiety,35,"does anybody feel like they were born too weak and sensitive for this world? this world favors strong character: confidence, self-respect, charisma, determination, fearlessness etc etc. obviously i don'anywhere in life. i find myself constantly daydreaming about an imaginary world, where i actually have friends, where i don't loathe myself so much, where life doesn't seem pointless and i have a purpose"
depression,bipolar,47,"if you feel shitty, help someone else not feel shitty. kinda shitty advice. but i'll start with some backstory. i'm on mobile so forgive me. (this will be kinda rambly) i was diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety disorder after i checked into a psychiatric hospital a few years back, but i always felt as i grew up that something was wrong. when i went to go meet my biological mother (who is very bipolar) when i was 18 things started to click with me that i needed to figure out a way to find meaning. it didn't help that my step-mom was an abusive cunt. so overall i kinda suck at being a person.(still do) anyways, i've struggled with constantly feeling down, and also feeling a whole lotta shit i didn't really understand. because of this i turned to weed and alcohol when i was 15. went through a few phases of drinking hard, but really weed was my poison of choice(still dont think it's bad but that's for another sub). again anyways because of the plant i kinda regained a sense of what it meant to be a healthy funcnt know how we'll pay the rent, things get complicated with family, with work, with life. and all of it together makes me wanna opt out. but then i think of leaving him by himself to deal with it himself and what a living hell that would be. even if i cant do much, ill do what i can till i can't. because if i dont that would make me sadder than anything i can ever encounter in my life. my point is that out there there are strong, amazing, incredibly intelligent and driven people, who do this shit alone. while feeling everything. and its heart breaking. my dad spent his life trying to make me feel welcome when every fiber of my being says i don't belong on this earth. the least i can do is gtfo bed and try to do something. even if my battle that day is just to brush my teeth. so that he can see a good looking smile that he made. to make him feel just a little better. that's my part, my mission. thats what gets me up. there are people that can use your help, and you owe it to them. but that s just my opinion."
ptsd,bipolar,49,no one will give me my meds i've seen three different doctors and none of them will give me my meds. i'm literally getting to the point i will just buy the pills off the internet and risk going to prison just to function. they keep trying to tell me there are other meds that help that aren't addictive. why do they keep telling me this fucking lie and why the fuck do they believe it!!! i guess i'll just drink to function because that's what these people fucking want. i want to strangle these fucking doctors.
anxiety,adhd,54,"yesterday i rented a car i had the day off and it was only 30 dollars a day (minus fuel). i drove around all day looking for tough places to parallel park. i switched lanes, i hit the gas, parallel parked some more, tried different things,  resolve as this one. all you need is some quality time with the vehicle. edit: i also got completely ass backwards lost and found my way back again via signs alone and even asked some stranger for directions. point is it's a great exercise."
ptsd,depression,59,binge eating i eat my feelings. sometimes it's worse than others. at the moment i'm going through a bad patch and i cant stop the feeling of needing to eat. does anyone else go through this? i just want to feel less alone
ptsd,anxiety,61,"i did everything right, and it didn't matter i went to a pool party this weekend for a friend's birthday i made playing dnd. one of the guys there picked me up in the water, i said ""i don't like touching,"" and he dunked me. he brought me back up, and i said ""stop! i don't like touching,"" and he dunked me again. a group of his friends was standing very close and could have stopped it, but i wasn't listened to with the respect i deserved. so, this guy got to grab me, put me in a panic attack, and have a great pary and specifically my mother failed to believe me and extract me from a nightmarish situation. just like i did everything right at the party and a group of my so-called nerd friends left me to deal with the situation on my own. i've also been struggling with feeling like i'm making a big deal out of a small flirtatious move. but it's the speaking my boundaries and wishes and having them ignored that feels so, so much like i'm 8 again. i'm 8, and i just have to acquiesce to a man's wishes and not consider my own."
adhd,anxiety,62,does curiosity kill you guys? ever since i can remember i've always been an extremely curious person and if i ever overheard someone talking about something like a secret or drama i would be dying to know what they were talking about and beg them to let me know too. right now i find myself absolutely torturing myself overis is why i grew to be such a manipulative person. so am i just nosey or you guys like this too? i also hate hate hate when someone starts to tell me something then says never mind and cuts it off. it can literally ruin the rest of my day if they refuse to tell me what they were gonna say (until i forget about it at least)
depression,bipolar,66,"failed 2 classes. now i’m on academic suspension. i really let it get out of hand this time folks. i got an email today saying i’m being excluded from my academics (meaning won’t be able to go to class...) because i didn’t pass 2 of my classes. so now, my choices are 1. talk to the dean to see if i qualify for a cancellation of exclusion, 2. get suspended, or 3e to the absolute limit. i’m not sure if i’ll be able to take it. i can’t live with my parents again. my dad doesn’t believe in mental illness whatever that means. thinking about this situation makes me hate everything. im so done with life. i don’t know why i even try anymore. i knew i wasn’t cut out for college and i might as well give up and go waitress again"
anxiety,adhd,76,"weekend's over... time to go to work... ""hey, it's monday! time to go to work! here... enjoy this feeling like it's your first day ever doing this."" ""but i've done this foe possibly did, and dread your impending failure."" ""but i can do this... i'm good at this. sure, i have my struggles but i..."" ""nope. impendiiiiiiiing dooooooooom!!!"" ""..."""
anxiety,depression,79,"i say ""i'm sorry"" too much for the most minimal of things, like standing in someone's way for just a moment. does anyone else notice this character trait? it's not out of habit, it's a subconscious quirk. i think, deep down, i legitimately believe i'm inconveniencing people when i say it."
bipolar,depression,90,"my father died today. or yesterday, maybe. im beginning a 20h odyssey halfway across the world to get to my father's funeral in time. the man died young, and it came out of nowhere. just numb right now, flashes of memories. going to try and stay sane for the family. wish me luck."
anxiety,depression,92,"i'm 18 and i feel awful unless i'm drunk or high i feel alone and useless unless i'm high or drunk. i might be failing classes at this point, or at least close to, but i can't go to class unless i'm on something without feeling like i want to kill myself or just give up completely. i'm even high right now, i haven't been sober in over a week."
bipolar,depression,104,"how i motivate myself to leave the house when i'm depressed and don't want to. like many of you, when i get depressed i tend to stay in my room, unshowered, and pass the days bingeing on netflix, hulu or amazon prime. i canceled netflix so i could afford movie pass. (i'm on a fixed income.) it's a subscription service that allows you to see one movie a day, every day, for $10 a month. (this is not an advertisement, juh me so it's like my own private showing. so maybe if you're like me and love movies, a subscription service may be the thing to help you leave the house. amc theaters also has a subscription service for $20 a month if you can afford that. (this is in the us). sinema has plans starting at $4.99 a month. if you love movies and want to have a motivation to leave the house once in a while, this may be a good idea for you."
adhd,ptsd,106,"i just want to say thank you to all of the subscribers of this subreddit. as emotional as it sounds, i never felt understood until i found you guys. seriously. i never realized other people struggled with as many of the same things that i struggle with. finding this community helped me realize that i'm not alone, and helped me better understand my mental illness. i am so grateful."
bipolar,ptsd,111,do you guys get nightmares? i had the worst one of my life tonight. i was psychotic and had a flashback to my attempt. multiple times. my hand was talking to me and telling me bad things. i have 3-4 nightmares a week and they aren't getting better. i don't know why this is happening.
bipolar,depression,114,"boyfriend says he’s not attracted to me anymore bc my depression i have schizoaffective disorder (bipolar+mild schizophrenia basically) and i’ve been in a depressed phase for maybe over 6 months. today my boyfriend, quite unexpectedly, said he’s no longer attracted to me because of my depression. he says i smell bad (i shower every other day) and don’t “take care of myself” leen pretty much the same weight our whole relationship so i haven’t really gotten fat or anything i’m insanely hurt but it also kinda opened my eyes how bad the depression has gotten &amp; maybe i didn’t really notice. but him not being “attracted” to me because i’m so depressed....man that freaking hurt. it’s not something i can switch on &amp; off. i love him. what can i do?"
depression,ptsd,119,i got raped twice and get bullied about it. i started to cry myself into sleep again for a week now and i don't know what to do anymore [context in the comments] i triedly delete it if that is the case. and apologize for losing myself in writing all that down. it actually kinda helped me just to write it down and get it off my shoulders!
ptsd,anxiety,140,"little bit of text spoke to me tonight. *maria sighed. “it is sometimes easier to be punished for something than it is to be a victim of random cruelty. as long as ingeth can tell herself that her voice was taken from her because she committed some sin, then she has some control of it, you understand? otherwise it was simply a terriblherself?* *the seventh bride, t. kingfisher* i really struggle with control. i also don't like being a victim, feeling like a victim, or admitting that i did everything i could have. this helped me see a different perspective. i'm still puzzling over this paragraph in a children's early chapter book like an hour after i came across it."
bipolar,anxiety,153,"finally put a couple good days together - this sub has really helped i just want to thank all the great people out there i have “met” the past few days. i felt such a sense of lonelinessing of good days continues. i hope the rest of you out there are putting some good days together as well, and if you are not, know you have a friend who is ready to listen. thanks again!"
adhd,anxiety,158,"rejuvenate just a friendly reminder to unclench your jaw, and remember it’s one day at a time. you’re doing great, and even if you’re not it’s okay. you are worthy, you are loved, and if today isn’t your day; i speak peace and warmth for your tomorrow. ❤️"
adhd,none,164,"""what kind of music do you listen to?"" no answer i just got finished with an interview and as the boss was walking me to the door he asked me what kind of music i listen to. i had absolutely no answer. i listen to m have this? i can listen to an album 100 times and not know what the album name is or what my favorite song off that album is called. it's so frustrating talking to people about music because i can't recall anything."
adhd,anxiety,179,"people sceptical of my diagnosis because i'm ""successful"" apologies for long post / first post awkwardness. i was diagnosed about a month ago after going to several doctors about my struggles. the first doctor dismissed me because ""i didn't fail in school"". the second said i was just distracted by my own anxiety. finally went to a psychiatrist who clocked add right away, paired with generalised anxiety disorder. the reactions of friends and family have been sceptical at best, and their main comment is ""but you've always done so well."" yes, from the outside i'm not a failure: * passed school * got a four year degree * got a job and got promoted * now self employed as a consultant the truth is, even though i was so desperate for a d **does everyone get an identity crisis when they get diagnosed?** do you find you have to retell your life story to people - with the ugly parts you never shared before - so that they get it? i also feel a little cheated because i'm 28 and have spent a lot of my adult life reading self-help books, trying to accept and love myself as i am. only to discover that things i've fought so hard to love about myself (like being overweight) are a legit by-product of messed up chemistry in my brain (i'm now losing weight effortlessly since starting concerta, because i'm not impulsively eating &amp; obsessing about food.) **tl;dr recently diagnosed, people don't believe me because i've never let myself fail in public. anyone else like this?**"
anxiety,depression,202,is anyone else tired of being tired? i feel drained and exhausted. every day. even when i exercise. i'm so lonely but no one ever hangs out with me or talks with me. most of my friends left and now i'm back to where i started. :/ i feel guilty to and idk why. i've never experienced this type of sadness before
bipolar,depression,205,so so so sick of waking up every day wanting it to end. medication has never worked for me. years of trial and error with different meds and different dosages has left me with no hope. i wonder what it’s like to have a brain that actually wants to live.
bipolar,depression,208,"had a fun conversation at a bar funny thing happened at a bar after a halloween comedy show. for halloween a guy dressed up as a cog in the capitalist machine. so i asked him, "" like ""me too but that's not what i was asking"" he also told me he finally got medicated and diagnosed properly after 27 years so i thought that was nice. he seemed really happy."
anxiety,depression,210,"anyone else develop poor memory? hey all, i've noticed recently that i've been putting things where they don't belong, or opening cabinets to look for things that i know are in another cabinet. i'm 20. sometimes i'll be walking and i'll havip my mind constantly or i'll remember that i never went somewhere i was supposed to and then think about it and think ""wait, yes i did do that/go there."" it's really scaring the shit out of me. anyone else have these types of memory lapses?"
bipolar,anxiety,228,"betting on myself i was offered a full-time job recently and turned it down due to mental health concerns. time has passed, i've had time to consider things further, and my circumstances regarding tint in my life. yes, a crap ton of stuff is going against me. but i feel like i can do this. for once, i'm taking that chance. as my best friend says, watch this space. it's about to get interesting."
depression,adhd,229,"i feel like a sim does anyone else ever feel like... they aren’t doing things for enjoyment but they’re just doing manual controls of themselves bc they have to? “ okay now it’s time to eat. okay that’s done, now it’s time to lay down. okay that’s done, now it’s time to see your friends” but everything really just feels like you’re going through the motions without any real enjoyment?"
bipolar,depression,241,"every couple weeks, i need to sleep for about half a day it doesn't seem to be related to depression. i don't feel depressed, i just feel really in need of sleep. the only problem here is that i'm soon to be employed again and i know i won't be able to just do this whenever i want. but it feels like ... a necessity, like going to the bathroom or something. my body just takes over and i need that sleep. does this happen to anyone else? how do you navigate it?"
adhd,ptsd,249,"terrifying i've been keeping a log for the last week. every 15 minutes from 6am to 9:45pm has a little box where i write what i do. i'm doing this to help see where my time is going. i use a highlighter to mark outnternet, lunch, reddit, flipping through books, exercising, shower. some of these things are useful of course, but the actual focused work time is far less than i thought. if you've not done this, it's worth trying."
depression,anxiety,256,"here's to devin i didn't wake up yesterday until 6pm. i laid in bed until 9, woke up and bought a case of beer and 2 packs of cigarettes and started binge drinking. i took a shower for the first time in days. i wanted to be clean and drunk for what i planned to do. today is my 25th birthday. i didn't want to live this day. i planned to cut my arms up and bleed to death in the shower, but i wanted to play a few last rounds of rocket league to calm my nerves. then i got a message from a random player i was in a few matches with: ""wanna play in a party? playing with randoms isfted my spirits throughout the day today. i've told my family everything and will be seeking help in the form of therapy and a possible medication adjustment, if necessary. if you're out there reading this and you can't see the way back up, cling to me and we'll climb up together. again, thank you all so much for taking the time out of your day to wish me well and feel free to pm me anytime or to add me on psn: coonroast55 (it has to do with my last name and the fact that me and my friends used to put -roast on the end of everyone's last name for no reason whatsoever). &lt;3"
bipolar,anxiety,262,"going back to the clinic after three years just wanted to share that i finally got myself together enough to book an appointment with the therapist. i kinda stopped going and kept putting it off (it's ok i'll go next month, etc.) three years later i find myself on the edge, i'm relieved to have made the call. wish me luck!"
depression,anxiety,267,"i washed and folded my laundry today. i usually dont wash or fold unless i absolutely have to, so i typically look like a mess. having folded clothes made me a little more confident when i got dressed that i could make it through today."
bipolar,anxiety,284,"just sharing my recent talk with my doctor monthly appointment with my doctor again. so i was a little worried about feeling this weird ""not caring"" on some things that i usually do. so i brought it up when he asked, is there anything yo bad? i replied, that's the issue, i don't know. i'm not sure if it is good or bad. i said maybe imm just tired of being stressed. he smiled and i was surprised when he said, then it's good that you are becoming resilient to daily stress."
adhd,bipolar,295,"*has one good day, or one good functional area in my life* “wow i must be faking this and maybe i don‘t have a problem after all!” *life falls apart the next day* some days, i get a lot of stuff done. if i’m on day: drops and breaks a mug, forgets to do any of the chores my partner asked me to, leaves a mess, lies down catatonic on the couch for hours, snaps at criticism and bursts into tears of frustration - oh, right."
adhd,anxiety,297,"i wish i could sleep so bad it makes me want to cry i just came to complain honestly. i’ve been trying to fall asleep for hours and i have to be up early and the fact that i have to wake up tomorrow morning stresses me out and then it makes it harder for me to sleep. i get so frustrated that people can just “go to sleep.” every time i put my phone away and close my eyes my mind just races with thoughts. sometimes anxious thoguhts, hypotheticalcalm down. it’s not even think it’s a panic attack, i can really only just describe it as just “one of those nights” and it’s torture. not to mention i’ve had like 2 different songs mentally playing while i’ve tried to write this and lost track of myself while writing this post about three times. anyways thanks for reading if u made it to the end. it’s just comforting knowing that i’m not the only one bc it genuinely feels like i’m going crazy."

ptsd,bipolar,346,"i hate everything i hate this disorder, i hate the people who did this to me, i hate the holidays, i hate knowing that no one is ever really going to actually care. when it comes down to it they just really don't. if i have to be so fucking lonely with this pain then i would rather just actually be alone then. i hate all of this."

bipolar,ptsd,373,"that left behind feeling? i've been feeling needy and ignored lately, the thing is i'm not interacting with anyone really outside my so. it's too much to handle right now. and my so gives me cuddles and is being helpful. there is really no one to ignore me, you know? but i just feel bad for some reason. i can't figure it out. i'm even upset when people don't reply or upvote my posts and that is really weird because i don't usually notice votes. i ruminate over whether i said the wrong thing or upset someone. i don't alwayen when i've gone into crisis i managed. i dunno, i felt a little weird after a session a few weeks ago. kinda like emdr weird and the session was kinda an unconscious exploring one, not emdr but a different therapy. i keep going back to that. i am left with just vague feelings i don't understand and just feeling uneasy. this is really bugging me. i keep expecting it to resolve, but when i'm resting or taking a time out to recharge it's really on my mind. and i feel unusually sensitive of late,since that weird appointment."

bipolar,anxiety,382,"feeling okay for once i started new meds a few weeks ago, and i think i found a good combination that works for me. i don't wake up wishing i was dead, i don't get irritable as much and i can go out in public without becoming super anxious. it's been harder to fall asleep and i have a few other small side effects, but they're not terrible. it's just nice to not be in a terrible mood 24/7. i hope others can find medications that work for them too!"
depression,adhd,385,"i always type out comments on how relate to someone and their situation, only to delete them and keep it to myself. i don't know if it's because i feel they won't care, like i'm being annoying, or if i realize i simply don't want to share. i just know i do it."

bipolar,depression,405,"on feeling broken and undeserving of romantic love i was recently pming with someone about relationships, heartbreak, and feeling broken and picked up on a shared sentiment. that our mental illnesses made us less deserving of love from healthy people. which my rational mind tells me is total bullshit, but it's still a sentiment i have to put effort into rejecting. it's no secret i've been investing serious time into online dating, but i think it's progress on my part that most of the time i don't feel like my mental illness disqualifies me from relationships with healthy people. i still feel like i'll be better understood by people who experience depression and whatnot and like my issues will be less of a burden to someone with their own struggles for me to give bed too and i'm no more broken than any ""normie."" *how many of you have struggled to feel like it's okay to have relationships with healthy people, and of those of you who have, what if anything has helped you chip away at that feeling?* as broken as i've felt and as flawed as i've been, i've never been broken and i've never stopped being worth loving. there have been things about me that have made it harder to love me, like my former bmi of nearly 40 as a barrier to that kind of attracted attention, but even then i was sometimes shown that kind of love. **however broken you may feel and however unlovable you may feel, you are most certainly mistaken. you are complete and just as flawed as everyone else and worthy of love, however hard it may be to find that love.**"

""i don't care if you fail, i care if you try."" too fucking bad dad, i care more if i fail than if i try, and i get that that doesn't get me anywhere; it feels pretty shitty to be reminded my ridiculous rejection sensitivity makes me a terrible person. fine, impedes my success. you didn't call me a terrible person. but that's what i'm getting at. the rejection sensitivity. what amounted to ""your not trying for the sake of avoiding getting hurt disappoints and irritates me"" turned into ""you're a terrible person."" or maybe i took it to mean ""you're broken."" i often think i am. how do you think it feels when i submit 10 job applications and my brain does the same thing about not hearing back? how do you think it feels to be constantly looking at jobs trying to balance what i'm qualified for, what won't be soul-crushingly mind-numbing, and what will actually move me forward in life? and then after beating myself up to get myself to start and continue that process, getting discouraged either not hearing back or hearing i didn't get the job. and then there of performing work and am now telling myself ""you're gonna be the lazy drug using social security beneficiary nobody wants to get their money"" while i tell myself i don't deserve it because i feel like a liar. but you know what? it may hurt, **but i take it on for you**. because i acknowledge my debilitating fear of trying on the job front and would rather take on shame than let my failure to launch weigh you down. when i was growing up, i used to tell myself ""no one can hurt you more than your own family."" i think that's still true for me today. thanks dad. *do you know why i changed therapists after you got your cancer diagnosis?* **i wanted to make sure you'd be proud of me before you died.** i sure as hell don't feel like you are right now. tl;dr: my dad hurt me and pissed me off by telling me he doesn't feel like i try and expressing frustration at how much time i put into videogames (where i can at least feel successful at **something**) when i spent less time on videogames today than half of what i spend most days in general. seriously, videogaming and weight loss are the only two things i've succeeded at since graduation. maybe not dying, too, but i don't think that should count. good to know i'm a disappointment."
anxiety,bipolar,439,"hey you yes. you. the person reading this right now. you're amazing. i'm telling you because you probably don't hear it as much as you deserve to. because you're battling some really tough things that most people won't ever understand. because even though you're doing that, and it's hell, yong to see you through the storms. because there will be storms. maybe you're in the storm right now. you'll get through it. because you're strong, stronger than you think you are. you're incredible and strong, and i know you can do it. i have faith in you. i'm here for you. you. are. amazing."

ptsd,bipolar,448,i use cheap bluetooth led lights to help regulate sleep. it is amazing. i bought a couple of bluetooth led lights from homedepot for around $15 each. through their app i setup 'schedules' that t is almost off. i still have plenty of nights of insomnia but it has helped me create a better routine and it helps so much that it happens automatically. anyone else tried something like this?
adhd,bipolar,468,"i highly recommend mark manson's new book ""the subtle art of not giving a f***,"" it's been my most valuable resource of the past week. i picked up this new book called the subtle art of not giving a f*** from one of my favorite writers, mark manson and i've found it incredibly useful for dealing with both myg what's most important for you and focusing your fucks on that. anyway, if the above quotes sparked your interest i highly recommend purchasing the book. there are many fantastic subtleties to the topic that i couldn't possibly put down into a short post and mark manson is a great. peace and have a good day."
bipolar,anxiety,470,"""1) nothing makes you happy/all you do is complain/2) everytime we talk, there's conflict, so i'm anxious whenever we speak/ 3) every time you talk, you complain."" i'm afraid of being this unhappy person who pushes people away. anyone hear else? 3 long stories; tldr at the bottom. so in the title, within quotation marks, are what i've heard from people i spent the most time with. 1) my mom, 2) a now-ex boyfriend, and 3) a former friend. 1) my mom kinda blew up in the parking lot of a hospital. the doctor said i didn't need a cough pill for my infection, and would be fine with only the prescription she gave me, and then my mom asked if she could prescribe me with a cough syrup. the doctor agreed to prescribe a strong cough syrup, and i asked if i don't need a cough pill, ""do i need cough syrup?"" the doctor said no, but said ""the medicines won't react with one another,"" and ""if you want a cough syrup, i can prescribe one."" *but i don't.* my cough won't go away (respitory infection) until the steroids kick in, but it will go away. i don't like taking meds i don't need. i'm defensive about this, because every time i have respitory issues, my mom asks the doc for a cough syrup ""for my own good"" and i feel like shit bc it's got some depressive drug in it, and i feel ultra sluggish the morning after i take it. i don't need it so i'm adverse to taking it. my mom says it's ridiculous that i have a cough and won't take a cough syrup, when no cough syrup was prescribed or suggested. the steroids will take it's course. but mothers will be mothers. i just hate taking drugs i don't actually need. (and i'm 18 so i'd think the doctor would have asked me first. guess not.) anyway she called me ungrateful and wouldn't let me speak and i dunno. it hit me. she said: ""i'm better off dead than i am alive to you, because nothing i do as your mother makes you happy."" i wanted to shoot myself in the mouth right there and then, ngl. i know that isn't the (logical) answer to this, but she isn't the only one who's said stuff like this. 2) my ldr boyfriend of two years broke up with me last night. he says he doesn't feel like he can talk to me, because he says offhanded things, and for a while, i didn't address them until months later (which is toxic). and now he feels that he'll fuck up no matter what he does, so what's the point. in the past i've addressed things as they came up and he either made fun of me, got super defensive, or asked ""so what's the problem?"". for example: he didn't speak to me for long periods of time. for like. a year. cancelled majority of skype dates at the last second. i said that i knew he has other obligations, but that still felt a bit emotionally neglected. (being left on read for days and sometimes weeks, not hearing from him for months, reading an ""i love you, too"" from him was rare. i felt like he didn't like me.) but he said that i had no reason to believe that. he had a roommate who made me cry, and he didn't defend me. even if i say that i didn't appreciate a comment, he would just join him. of course, he didn't mean to be rude, and of course he didn't mean to overlook my crying, didn't mean to misunderstand me. but he refused to buy earbuds because of his ""indispoable income"" (even if he went out to drink once a month). which gave his roommate ammo to be a bully. so i mailed my then-bf earbuds and he lost them. it felt as if he didn't put any effort into the relationship, and was justifying himself. when i asked if he wanted to break up, he sounded surprised and confused as to why. said that he loves me. i wasn't angry, just hurt and confused with all the mixed messages. but i said i believed him and ignored my gut. plus, on holidays, he drives six hundred miles in one go to visit me (and his family. so contrary to what he says, i'm not the only reason he comes to the city i live in.) but he said ""you think i wanna see my family? barely anyone there wants to see me. i'md avoiding me, too. avoiding everyone. got in a real bad funk. said uncalled for comments to me and to other people. i understand how depression can be; but that doesn't excuse her from being mean. from playing rough and with scissors (as a seventeen year old). from going out of her way to patronize people. but she put on her snapchat story her suicidal thoughts, talking about how everyone she knows is against her. so i swiped up, let her know that i apologize if i wronged her, and that i want her to be okay. that i don't think anyone is against her. that i am here if she needs to talk. she said that i can't make her pity me, and i was baffled. that she doesn't have the energy for my bullshit. (yikes.) that i shouldn't play nice if i don't feel nicely about a person. (still don't know what's she was talking about but it was childish. but still yikes.) and then she said all i do is complain about my family problems and boyfriend and do nothing to fix it. (that was when i said ""good to know,"" and blocked her. hehe.) it's so funny that she *asked me* what's wrong, didn't accept ""nothing"" for an answer, and then secretly hated when i was open and honest. i thought she was my friend. but i guess only therapists are meant to hear your problems. anyway. i digress. days after i blocked her, she came around me in person. went out of her way to sit next to me. acted fearful, as if i would reject her. took every single chance she got to be overly nice. for example: i was presenting and the class (of 13 people) was talking over me. she stood up, cupped both hands over her mouth, and projected: ""everyone! chris is talking! it is important to hear what they say, so that they can finish their presentation!"" sat down, then grinned at me. the class had the same weirded-out expression as i did. like. ugh. that was so artificial that it hurt me. i have a floridan friend who i tell some of these situations with, and he says it sounds like the other person has some unsolved problems of their own. my therapist said the same thing about all three scenarios. that nothing i complain about is like. ""i'm so sad my dad got me a blue car. i wanted a red one."" y'know? like the problems that bother me are literally ""so i'm homeless and don't know where i'm sleeping tonight "" or ""i got 27 spider bites in my sleep"" or ""my mom is threatening to kick me out and i'm an unemployed student"" or something that can't be given advice, because it's totally out of anyone's control. like when my car got totalled and i kept having flashbacks about the crash throughout the day. i couldn't sleep at night. for weeks. or when three of my classmates died. or when i was in a sexually abusive relationship for six months, got assaulted everyday on school grounds, and didn't tell anyone for eight months. i have flashbacks and awful dreams about *that* one to this day. but i don't say anything until someone asks me what's wrong. and even if they do, i'm reluctant to say so. bc none of this can be hugged better. it's heavy. it's uncomfortable and nobody wants to hear it. those are the only things that get to me. those are the things i go to therapy for. but my therapist doesn't believe in dwelling on (talking about) past traumas and griefs. i don't know what anyone wants me to do anymore. do i just let go of *everything*? i do not exagerrate; these things happened in the same twelve months. i'm not trying to excuse my complaints, but, yikes. i don't know what to make of any of this. anyway. tldr: nobody i open up to stick around. are all of these situations like. situations where both parties have made acceptable mistakes in handling their situation? or am i this unhappy person who makes people miserable because i complain so much? am i ungrateful? am i being crazy for saying the things i do? does anyone else hear statements like these from people who see you the most? it's times like these that makes self destructive behavior so easy."
depression,ptsd,471,i’m angry at society for forcing me to stay alive i hate the fact that euthanasia is not legal in the u.s. imagine being severely sick and suffering and people forcing you to stay alive. that seems like a form of torture to me. i wish guns where legal were i live i would have killed myself a long time ago.
bipolar,ptsd,477,"i'm so sick of being alone. i live with my family. we have different schedules so we don't see each other a lot. when we do, we get along okay, but they just don't understand me. it sounds super cliche but... we don't have a lot of the same things in common. they don't want to talk about the stuff i like to talk about, and on the off chance i do end up having a conversation about said things, i'm left feeling... ashamed? that's not the right word.ds me and the things i go through. and it's hard to find those kinds of people. i feel like the people around me are not on the same intellectual level as i am. not to say that they're stupid, because they're not, but our interests are just not the same. i need mental stimulation. i need adult conversation. i'm just here to vent, but is there anyone here who understands what i'm trying to say? i'm in my mid 20's, but i feel like an angsty teenager."
depression,bipolar,486,"yeah, i'm gonna kill myself. i've been dealing with this long enough that i'm fairly certain things aren't going to get better. medication doesn't work. talk therapy doesn't work. hitting the gym doesn't work. getting degrees in psychology doesn't wo post isn't really that helpful here. i just wanted to get the thoughts out of my head and articulate them to someone other than myself. please don't tell me to call a hotline and listen to some underpaid stranger try to convince me that i'm mistaken."

anxiety,ptsd,699,"can someone make me (21f) feel better? i feel humiliated :( i’ve had the worst week of my life. pretty much lost the will to live. my anxiety has been at a all time high since i calmed it down a while ago. as seen via my last post i got sexually assaulted nearly 7 days ago and i’ve been going off the rails ever since. i’ve barely been sober and have been promiscuous which i’ve never been before and i have no idea why after my assault all i want it for boys to respect me and say the right things before any sexual activity occurs. i had a boy say to me he wanted to get to know me before we had sex even though it was a one night stand and if it wasn’t for that nothing would of happened between us. it gave me at the time some false sense of security knowing i’m worth something and i’m not actually just a disposable machine that’s only good for one thing and that’s it? i went out last nigely humiliated, i know a few of them don’t like me that’s evident and i’m not sure why because i’ve not personally met any of them that don’t seem to like me, a lot of it has to be because of the guy i used to see and another guy i used to see who was also there. there was also drama as on friday someone slyly took a picture of me with a boy who had his arm around me who has a girlfriend (which i didn’t know) so everyone knows it’s me but they’re only not saying anything because the boy would fight all of them and probably win and his girlfriend showed up and punched him in the face and said he cheated on her, so i was quite a big topic of conversation in that apartment clearly and it’s giving me such bad anxiety i’m just worrying what people think of me and what was said about me i just don’t know what to do... i feel like i need to redeem myself but yet i’ve just done nothing wrong?"

depression,ptsd,727,"six months, yet i mourn no less... my 17 year old son committed suicide six months ago. it was frustrating for me to read the top thread here today. people did care. his friends cared. his dad, me and his two brothers cared. we supported him. we got him help. we listened. we hugged him a lot. i spent hours and hours in conversation with him. it wasn't a burden. he had a unique perspective and was wise beyond his years. he was never seen as a burden. we didn't patronize him. we didn't tell him stupid nonsense. we did our best to understand. e same. mostly because we miss him so much but also our resulting trauma. even so, i hold no anger towards him. i still cry every day. so much of who i was, was tied to being his mom. i'm at sea as to what meaning and purpose i now have... anyway, i wrote this to mark the anniversary of the last time i looked into his beautiful blue eyes only to see the spark that made him a compassionate, intelligent, loving soul was gone. also, to dispel the idea that all suicides happen to people who were not loved and/or supported. thank you for reading."

anxiety,ptsd,741,"recently i've been diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses that have led to me being fired from my job. my doctor and counselor have me listed as extreme anxiety and depression, early childhood ptsd, bi polar, borderline personality disorder. it's a relief to have an answer to what my problems are. this has been an on going problem my whole adult life. my first job, i had reasons for being depressed. i dropped out of school, parents were divorcing and i didn't have a stable housing situation, i was falling behind and depressed, full of anger and anxiety. i didn't want to call myself weak though and admit i had a problem, so i attempted to self medicate by escaping reality. i skateboarded, played video games, drank, smoked weed, partied, did everything i could to feel numb. 5 years later, because i didn't seek help or medicationn test, then i can finish my sdi application. my point to all this is i would be homeless and probably dead without her. she has saved my ass countless times over the years,having a mental illness makes holding a job so fucking difficult, i've lost at least 6 jobs since being with her. i have nothing but respect and love for her to be putting up with all this, while we are both still fairly young (i'm 24, she's 21 later this year) i wish her parents understood mental illness, but it's kind of a taboo in her family so we keep things as vague as possible. i just hope that i get through to disability services and can make an income that way, to relieve some stress from her life. she put off school for me from the very beginning, the least i can do is help her get through school. sorry about the rant. i hope everyone has a great day."

depression,anxiety,900,"have you ever felt that some people's lives were predicted to be great but your life not? i am talking about people that have it all. they are pretty, loved, successful, rich, happy, have a lot of friends and they accomplish everything they think of. life seems like a walk through a rose garden to them. they euestioning yourself, life, faith or god if there really isn't even a small piece of happiness for you in this world when there's plenty of happiness for others. you never asked too much from life but even the little you have asked for was not given to you. another day passes by and you try to keep up the fight."

anxiety,depression,922,"i'm pathetic... i'm 25, no friends, living with my parents, struggling to finish school - i feel like i don't have any coping mechanisms anymore? anyone been here at my age? the older i get, the worse i seem to be at, i don't know, functioning in general. i used to be really sociable, have plenty of friends, i did well in school, had hobbies and interests - i was weird, but enough people liked me that i didn't think about it. after high school it was like the blinders were taken off and i started to see all these things about myself that i really, really hated. i started struggling a lot in social situations, i flunked out of a really good university, i couldn't hold a job, i gradually lost contact with my friends... i was a mess. don't see how to salvage any of that from what i've let myself become. i think a big part of my problems is that i'm so used to trying and failing that i'm afraid that's the only outcome if i try again. i look at myself and think ""i've given up,"" because i have. i don't want to! but i don't know how to make life work for me anymore. i don't know how to connect with people. i go out somewhere and it's impossible to think or talk clearly through the static in my head that makes me nauseous and stutter and my heart pound. what kind of a life is one where you can't even talk to someone without turning into an idiot or crying after? i can't function like this. i'll never be able to work like this. has anyone overcome a similar situation?"
depression,anxiety,940,"does anyone else feel like they’re in a trance, of sorts? as if they’re just floating through life - which feels intangible in itself - with very little or no purpose? that’s the best i can explain how i feel, i guess. it’s odd, but the only thing i’ve felt for a while now, so is strangely comforting duenot a lack of awareness; i’m almost hyper-aware of everything (sometimes called creepily observant). i don’t know how to describe it, really. justa constant star of being “out of it”. i was just curious if anyone else feels the same way? let me know if you do and we can try and explain it to each other :)"
adhd,depression,941,"what learned helplessness is like just in case anyone isn't aware of what learned helplessness feels like, and as a warning to people not to keep trying the same thing over and over, i've written the following. i will use the term ""brain"" to refer to the unconscious, impulsive parts of the brain, the parts that aren't ""you"", and ""you"" to refer to your conscious experience and rational brain. (disclaimer, this is only my experience, i don't know what other people's experiences are.) --- imagine walking around, going through life, except you don't decide what you do. your brain decides everything for you and you have no say. it wants to play video games, so you play video games. that isn't to say you don't fight it, but on those occasions that you do you either are simply unable to do anything, or every frustration with yourself for every past failure floods upon you, washing your willpower away in a tidal wave of anxiety. you quickly learn the only way to fight is to not fight at all. --- now, imagine somebody calmly tells you, ""i know it's hard, but you really need to just get up and do it. i have no magic bullet unfortunately."" this is nice, they know that you have a hard time ""just doing it"" but at this point there's no way around it, it just needs to be done. you wholeheartedly agree with them, and feel like the ultimate solution _is_ to ""just do it"". your brain however immediately reminds you how ""it's never worked before, so why will it work now?"" this isn't just a small voice, it is backed by the combined anxiety of every failure and inadequacy you have ever had. --- i'll attempt to explain what lies behind this sense of hopelessness: this sense of hopelessness, in its simplest form, is the feeling that ""it's never worked, so why would it change?"" however, it goes deeper than that. the following is the main thought process: - according to other people you just need to try hard enough to solve the problem - you feel ""i just don't care anymore"" ( ditto ) - ""i hate myself"" (when i metaphorically close my eyes, cover my ears, and run from what i need to do yelling ""lalalalalalalala"", also when i am sitting doing something i enjoy and remember what i'm supposed to be doing) - ""i just can't."" (when i try to calm myself or when i'm lying in a fetal position on the bed, spiraling deeper into depression) - ""i just want the world to go away"" (this feeling makes me realize why some people kill themselves. i fortunately just retreat to my bed or some form of entertainment that allows my brain to shut off temporarily) --- i'm not saying this is permanent problem, or that there aren't any solutions, just that it's incredibly difficult, more difficult than i feel most anyone can imagine. it's the torture of hopelessness, with the frustration of fully knowing with your rational brain that hope itself is all that is needed to solve the problem, yet finding that hope hopelessly far away. please, everyone. think before you tell someone to ""just try."" they may have forgotten how to. --- edit: some people may say that you just need to build in systems, and i agree that that is a good solution, but at least for me, i've tried so many of my own systems that even trying to talk with it causes my brain to lock up with anxiety. likely because it forces me to confront all my past failures, which further discourages me from trying. i'd still love to hear any advice people have though. --- tl;dr; learned helplessness isn't thinking you are helpless, it is feeling that you've forgotten how to try. if you really wanted to try it would have worked, since people say to just try, so you must not really _want_ to try, so you begin to instead want to want to try. in addition, confronting it in any way brings with it all the anxiety of every past failure, meaning that often, instead of doing something you often fail to do you just close your eyes and hope it'll go away."

ptsd,anxiety,1085,"pretty extreme anxiety lately. i feel completely trapped in my own head. i've had that ""chair is about to fall backward"" feeling day in and day out for like three weeks now. it's becoming exhausting. i feel like a thousand screaming emotions are trapped behind a stone exterior. i can't cry or yell or write. i can't express anown symptoms most of the time, it's just particularly bad right now and trying to out-logic my emotions is just overwhelming sometimes. right now is one of those times. you guys are my people and i guess i'm not really looking for solutions, just someone to remind me that it will pass and maybe offer up some tips on self-care."
ptsd,depression,1086,how can i accept the fact that nobody cares about me? i understand that it says more about them but i can’t help but feeling pain whenever i see yet another person that shows deliberate apathy towards me. everyone in my family and everyone i thought was my friend have been narcissistic. incapable of empathy.

depression,anxiety,1099,my colleagues have photos of their teenage years with their friends having fun or on holidays. i have screen caps of world of warcraft. depression (and then later anxiety) really robbed me of my teen years and early 20s. in woft most nights. some of my most memorable nights were spent in my bedroom eating pizza and playing wow until 5 and birds were chirping outside. i really do feel like i'm an outsider looking in at all the normal people sometime.

bipolar,anxiety,1353,"not feeling after witnessing an attempted suicide i was waiting for the bus after my group ended at the outpatient clinic outside the hospital. i was walking when i saw a male, on hospital grounds near the emergency room and outpatient clinic entrance, slitting his wrists with a razor. there were people everywhere. a group of women were sitting right next to him- but they all did nothing! i ran back into the hospital and told security ab stretchers to help him. we were also across the street from a mental health emergency clinic. last week, i traveled outside the state to visit my brother who lives in a homeless shelter, and suffers from schizophrenia. i was just given a surprise diagnosis of add as well which has me worried sick. i also just celebrated my 30th birthday, but i feel like a complete mess! i don't know what to do besides remind myself 'that this will pass.'"
bipolar,ptsd,1360,"be kind to yourself i know i still deal with a lot of guilt because of my own journey of recovery: the starts and stops, random days when you’re not coping the best, fe perspectives, experiences, and places we start from. if you’re road is bumpy, off the beaten path, that’s ok. if anything, remember to be kind to yourself this weekend."
anxiety,depression,1366,"ever feel guilty because others probably have it worse than you? a lot of my anxieties feel tied to first world problems, a sort of inability to feel satisfied no matter what i do, even when there are countless others who no doubt have far tougher obstacles in life. anyone else feel this way? doesn’t stop me worrying about it."
anxiety,ptsd,1371,"i feel so at peace so i managed to do my first proper run just now, and my mind feels so clear i almost can't believe it. just wanted to share! stay strong you guys! &lt;3"
adhd,anxiety,1380,"annoyed at literally everything does anyone else ever just get pissed off at anything that happens some days? like, the tv remote falls off your counter and it's just a pain even though it will take less than a second to pick up and fix or how about constantly having to piss because you drink an excessive amount of water per day and you just can't be fked going all the time? just me..? ok"
anxiety,ptsd,1382,"totally losing it right now.. i start a new job tomorrow, haven't been able to leave my house in 3 months this should be a celebratory post but i've spent two days awake, shaking, throwing up or otherwise... i don't know if i can do it but i can't live the hell of staying in our 1 bedroom apartment any longer. i got hired at an oil  that off my mind. except when i shopped there i dreaded when the employees bombed me with information. so yeah, i work at 2 tomorrow expecting to not last the 2 week probation period. everything i'm studying just gets lost in my head and i retreat back to my no window bedroom calm down. but i can't lose my car or stay in this house."
anxiety,bipolar,1387,"2020 has destroyed my progress and it sucks. i came into this year in a good place after years of wading through shit. i was kicking ass at my job, i have sorted a long term medical problem, i achieved dreams this winter by freeride snowboarding a mountain. i came out as bi / genderfluid to my family and it went well. but this year since then has fucked me up. i haven't touched another human in three months. i'v self harm happening again every day recently. i don't want to see any more fucking therapists any more i hate the idea of it. i can't go through reopening all that painful old stuff again i don't want to deal with this bullshit any more. i don't want to burden my family with this, i've put them through enough. fucking 2020. its a good job i don't have a gun because its sure looking like a way to escape recently."
ptsd,depression,1394,"my therapist has cancer just, come on, universe! really? this therapist saved my life, i owe everything to her, but now i have to watch her go through chemo and radiation completeds because the chemo fucks with her brain. i'm not looking for sympathy or advice, just a rant because it feels like the one thing in the whole world that i can't discuss with her."
ptsd,depression,1399,"after a bit of scrolling... i’m crying because reading some of these posts really make me feel validated and like i’m not alone. this week has been god awful, but finding this sub and being able to relate / not feel so alone is really helpful and i’m really happy that this community exists."
adhd,depression,1403,"incredibly bored with life i don't know how to best explain this feeling i have all the time, but extreme boredom comes kinda close. dissatisfaction with everything. i often hate my life so much, because i feel li more exciting things i just feel like i could might as well be dead. i'm so bored, so disappointed, so unmotivated, that lying down and just dying seems like a good alternative. what do i even do about this? help."
bipolar,depression,1409,"common cognitive distortions came across this and thought they may be useful for anyone suffering from mild depression: does anyone religiously do cbt and if so did it help? **common cognitive distortions** a partial list from robert l. leahy, stephen j. f. holland, and lata k. mcginn’s [*treatment plans and interventions for depression and anxiety disorders*] (2012) 1. **mind reading** you assume that you know what people think without having sufficient evidence of their thoughts. “he thinks i’m a loser.” 2. **fortune-telling** you predict the future negatively: things will get worse, or there is danger ahead. “i’ll fail that exam,” or “i won’t get the job.” 3. **catastrophizing** you believe that what has happened or will happen will be so awful and unbearable that you wothe way i feel now,” or “my parents caused all my problems.” 10. **what if?** you keep asking a series of questions about “what if” something happens, and you fail to be satisfied with any of the answers. “yeah, but what if i get anxious?,” or “what if i can’t catch my breath?” 11. **emotional reasoning** you let your feelings guide your interpretation of reality. “i feel depressed; therefore, my marriage is not working out.” 12. **inability to disconfirm** you reject any evidence or arguments that might contradict your negative thoughts. for example, when you have the thought i’m unlovable, you reject as irrelevant any evidence that people like you. consequently, your thought cannot be refuted. “that’s not the real issue. there are deeper problems. there are other factors.”"
none,adhd,1410,"whats a nicer way to say ""you shouldnt worry about my marks, just focus on your own"" maybe this way of saying it is fine, but when people ask around and compare test scores, i genuinely believe and want to tell people that they shouldn't focus on what other people scored but focus on themselves and their own work. i don't want to sound too formal or even rude since i am a student. so how should i reply to people asking whatever test mark i received?"
bipolar,depression,1413,"first try at spoken word writing... last week i wore my hair up everyday to work. not because i particularly like the way it looks, but because i couldn’t will myself the effort to take a shower for 5 days. wearing my “depression” hoodie that is 3 sizes too big, just so i can ignore my weight issue and have it’s dog hair covered fabric drape around my already dirty pajama shirt that i wore the last 4 nights. being this kind of sad is funny that way even something as mundane and rudimentary as doing my lke a ball of glitter about to explode taking shots at the bar with my friends and oversharing too much with too many people this happiness turns agitated and irritable every small inconvenience feels like i might just turn green, sprout some brown shorts and call myself hulk like a rubber band that is twisting tighter and tighter until it snaps. and cuts my arm with an exacto knife and down i fall again… when people ask me how i am they should just ask me who i am today and what does my laundry look like"
adhd,bipolar,1422,"in september i made a post about getting in to grad school. just finished my first semester with a 3.75 :) not once did i believe i'd be able to make it through. i had come up with backup plans at least 4 times in preparation for t project for work or an application or an entire school program, or maybe even just reading a book, you can do it. we all can. this disorder doesn't have to define us. thanks to everyone here for being so supportive, you guys rock."
depression,ptsd,1433,"my marriage evaporated in an instant i came home from work and my husband had moved out. we had been together for more than 15 years. no desire to discuss what went wrong, no chance of reconciliation, no warning... he was just gone. i’ve had mdd for 9 years following a traumatic brain injury. now i’m in the deepest depression i can imagine. i’ve been hospitalized. i’ve been thru 7 weeks of outpatient. i can barely also wonder how long until everything physically starts falling apart around me because i’m not functioning and i’m alone in this house. i try to keep it clean. i care for my pets. i try to talk to someone every day so i’m not completely isolated. i’m working part time again and slugging thru it. it’s torture. i just needed to share this with someone other than my journal. the struggle to just survive is so painful."
depression,anxiety,1437,does anyone else feel worse after having a good time? anytime i go to a party or an event i just feel worse afterwards. every part of me just feels completely worse after the event. am i just going crazy or does this happen to others?
adhd,bipolar,1438,big middle finger to my pre med advisor and chemistry teacher who told me i wouldnt amount to anything because i couldnt pay attention in her course!! it's bdeal with her again but i still want to rub my resume in her face so she can see how very wrong she was and how far i went without her breathing down my neck.
ptsd,anxiety,1464,"i feel like my life is a very dark game of thrones episode it may be bizarre to say this but ... i cannot think, i cannot feel, i cannot do anything because i am too scared to do anything because i cannot trust anyone because i feel that i am living among a world of sharks, justre are probably good people out there and i applaud you for that but just like in the world of game of thrones, the good people always lose because is a messy, messy place that is filled and made up of lies and dirty work because somehow humanity is inherently evil, to this point"
bipolar,depression,1468,"does anyone get in depressions so low that you feel like you are practically evil from all the guilt and stuff that you feel? does anyone get in depressions so low that you feel like you are practically evil from all the guilt and stuff that you feel? i hassed, nothing touches it. my entire world feels dark and closing in. i don't even want help at these points, because i ""know"" i do not deserve it. just wondering who else experiences this and what can be done to keep yourself somewhat grounded or something."
adhd,depression,1469,"only you would appreciate this nobody else in my life would understand this but i know you guys would. all my life i have been shit at school and academic learning. i've been medicated for almost two years now. i heard today that my assignment for a professional qualification scored 80%, one of the highest marks given. i could never have done that prior to treatment. i am so god damn proud of myself."
bipolar,ptsd,1474,"yesterday my ex started harassing me and then a friend choked me yesterday was rough. i broke things off with my ex the day before yesterday due to some toxic and manipulative behavior. he freaked out on me and has been sending me messages on every app possible saying some of the most horrible things imaginable up until yesterday evening when i blocked him on everything possible. we we're dating for 6 years and i feel so fucking dumb. it was obvious helogized and then when i said i didn't want to hang again he tried to blame me for his actions so i blocked him too. i think i'm ok emotionally, but what the fuck? idk why i keep attracting people like this. i just don't understand and i'm so sick of it. i'm a sweet person and i don't feel like i deserve it. anyway, i just wanted to vent about my fucking horrible day yesterday. it was a scary day. as always, you guys are wonderful people and thank you :)"
anxiety,ptsd,1478,"im so proud of me! sounds conceited, but i am. and nobody to talk to about it. kids dad ended up getting a damn dui with our two kids in the car. 😡 cys (child protective services) ended up coming to my house to talk to me kind and i didn't even cry. everything is fine now. it wasn't as hard as i thought it was! :,) to do something that makes me proud of me... im in a happy daze. now if only i can be brave enough to leave this post up.. lol"
depression,bipolar,1484,i get near suicidal just from having my period lately i was so happy. but then my period came along and i can barely function. it didn't use to be this severe either. the depression is unbelievably bad. i feel so disoriented. home doesn't feel like home. etc.... edit: thanks everyone ❤ i'll talk to my dr to find out if there's something else going on. there's gotta be another way 😪
