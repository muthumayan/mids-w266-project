anxiety,adhd,23,"i actually did it. found an amazing new job in a much better city, faced my boss to quit my current job. found a house, turned on utilities, and scheduled movers. i'm not going to lie. it was hell. every step of it was panic attacks, fear, and ard to follow through, or hard to even start. just try and think about the end goal, not the process. it doesnt make it easy. but it gives you just enough motivation to keep taking one more small step at a time. as dory says, ""just keep swimming""."

anxiety,depression,78,"depersonalization/dissociating? depersonalization/dissociating is the closest thing i've found to how i feel but not quite. i feel like i'm just floating through my days. like they fade into each other and i'm just trying to get through each one to make it idon't feel like i can relate to anyone either, so i don't bother going out of my way to communicate with anyone (say in a class setting) which just adds to the not-present feeling. what is this called, if anything? and what can i do about it? i'm so miserable"

adhd,bipolar,103,"""are you retarded?"" apologies for the use of that word in this post, for those who might be sensitive to it. *edit again* copy/pasting a comment to another user: where i'm from people use it as a slur toward the autism community. i'm actually not even sure it's just where i'm from - i see it all over the internet too. i don't personally think they're synonymous but since i witness ""autistic"" and ""retarded"" being used in the same sentence by shitty people all the time, i only wanted to be clear that i don't feel the same way and that i don't want to hurt anyone with my post :( that's why i had previously written that i don't use that word, nor would i ever call somngelist. but when i argue with my boyfriend i can barely remember what i've just said...i can't always remember how the argument even started. i get really flustered and then that gets worse. all i seem to hear is ""you're wrong."" i'm not always good at getting across what i mean the first time, either. so in frustration last night, my boyfriend asked me ""are you retarded?"" and it honestly hurt me a bit. i know some of you have had people ask you that. you start giving the question some thought because you feel you can't do anything right, ever. i'm not sure why i'm making this post...just feeling down in general. fucks with me every time, when someone asks me that."

anxiety,depression,294,"recently i've been diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses that have led to me being fired from my job. my doctor and counselor have me listed as extreme anxiety and depression, early childhood ptsd, bi polar, borderline personality disorder. it's a relief to have an answer to what my problems are. this has been an on going problem my whole adult life. my first job, i had reasons for being depressed. i dropped out of school, parents were divorcing and i didn't have a stable housing situation, i was falling behind and depressed, full of anger and anxiety. i didn't want to call myself weak though and admit i had a problem, so i attempted to self medicate by escaping reality. i skateboarded, played video games, drank, smoked weed, partied, did everything i could to feel numb. 5 years later, because i didn't seek help or medicationn test, then i can finish my sdi application. my point to all this is i would be homeless and probably dead without her. she has saved my ass countless times over the years,having a mental illness makes holding a job so fucking difficult, i've lost at least 6 jobs since being with her. i have nothing but respect and love for her to be putting up with all this, while we are both still fairly young (i'm 24, she's 21 later this year) i wish her parents understood mental illness, but it's kind of a taboo in her family so we keep things as vague as possible. i just hope that i get through to disability services and can make an income that way, to relieve some stress from her life. she put off school for me from the very beginning, the least i can do is help her get through school. sorry about the rant. i hope everyone has a great day."

adhd,anxiety,393,"why can't i do ""unhealthy"" stuff responsibly? video games, weed, watching porn, eating fatty foods, drinking, etc. these are all things i find very hard to control. when i smoke a bit of weed i crave more instantly and i don't stop smoking until i'm baked out of my mind. whenever i'm feeling bad i start overeating, which leads to me feeling worse, which leads to more overeating. whenever i feel bored (which is quite often) i play video games. this leads to me using only vial with difficult emotions, and i dull myself with unhealthy behaviours, instead of just accepting the emotions and processing them in a healthy way. when i stop using these behaviours the negative thoughts and emotions start hitting me very hard. but probably that's just a phase you have to go through, to get out better on the otherside. are there others who struggle with balancing life like me? if you've found a solution, please elaborate. is this just a discipline thing?"

bipolar,depression,422,"common cognitive distortions came across this and thought they may be useful for anyone suffering from mild depression: does anyone religiously do cbt and if so did it help? **common cognitive distortions** a partial list from robert l. leahy, stephen j. f. holland, and lata k. mcginn’s [*treatment plans and interventions for depression and anxiety disorders*] (2012) 1. **mind reading** you assume that you know what people think without having sufficient evidence of their thoughts. “he thinks i’m a loser.” 2. **fortune-telling** you predict the future negatively: things will get worse, or there is danger ahead. “i’ll fail that exam,” or “i won’t get the job.” 3. **catastrophizing** you believe that what has happened or will happen will be so awful and unbearable that you wothe way i feel now,” or “my parents caused all my problems.” 10. **what if?** you keep asking a series of questions about “what if” something happens, and you fail to be satisfied with any of the answers. “yeah, but what if i get anxious?,” or “what if i can’t catch my breath?” 11. **emotional reasoning** you let your feelings guide your interpretation of reality. “i feel depressed; therefore, my marriage is not working out.” 12. **inability to disconfirm** you reject any evidence or arguments that might contradict your negative thoughts. for example, when you have the thought i’m unlovable, you reject as irrelevant any evidence that people like you. consequently, your thought cannot be refuted. “that’s not the real issue. there are deeper problems. there are other factors.”"

adhd,anxiety,832,"what learned helplessness is like just in case anyone isn't aware of what learned helplessness feels like, and as a warning to people not to keep trying the same thing over and over, i've written the following. i will use the term ""brain"" to refer to the unconscious, impulsive parts of the brain, the parts that aren't ""you"", and ""you"" to refer to your conscious experience and rational brain. (disclaimer, this is only my experience, i don't know what other people's experiences are.) --- imagine walking around, going through life, except you don't decide what you do. your brain decides everything for you and you have no say. it wants to play video games, so you play video games. that isn't to say you don't fight it, but on those occasions that you do you either are simply unable to do anything, or every frustration with yourself for every past failure floods upon you, washing your willpower away in a tidal wave of anxiety. you quickly learn the only way to fight is to not fight at all. --- now, imagine somebody calmly tells you, ""i know it's hard, but you really need to just get up and do it. i have no magic bullet unfortunately."" this is nice, they know that you have a hard time ""just doing it"" but at this point there's no way around it, it just needs to be done. you wholeheartedly agree with them, and feel like the ultimate solution _is_ to ""just do it"". your brain however immediately reminds you how ""it's never worked before, so why will it work now?"" this isn't just a small voice, it is backed by the combined anxiety of every failure and inadequacy you have ever had. --- i'll attempt to explain what lies behind this sense of hopelessness: this sense of hopelessness, in its simplest form, is the feeling that ""it's never worked, so why would it change?"" however, it goes deeper than that. the following is the main thought process: - according to other people you just need to try hard enough to solve the problem - you feel ""i just don't care anymore"" ( ditto ) - ""i hate myself"" (when i metaphorically close my eyes, cover my ears, and run from what i need to do yelling ""lalalalalalalala"", also when i am sitting doing something i enjoy and remember what i'm supposed to be doing) - ""i just can't."" (when i try to calm myself or when i'm lying in a fetal position on the bed, spiraling deeper into depression) - ""i just want the world to go away"" (this feeling makes me realize why some people kill themselves. i fortunately just retreat to my bed or some form of entertainment that allows my brain to shut off temporarily) --- i'm not saying this is permanent problem, or that there aren't any solutions, just that it's incredibly difficult, more difficult than i feel most anyone can imagine. it's the torture of hopelessness, with the frustration of fully knowing with your rational brain that hope itself is all that is needed to solve the problem, yet finding that hope hopelessly far away. please, everyone. think before you tell someone to ""just try."" they may have forgotten how to. --- edit: some people may say that you just need to build in systems, and i agree that that is a good solution, but at least for me, i've tried so many of my own systems that even trying to talk with it causes my brain to lock up with anxiety. likely because it forces me to confront all my past failures, which further discourages me from trying. i'd still love to hear any advice people have though. --- tl;dr; learned helplessness isn't thinking you are helpless, it is feeling that you've forgotten how to try. if you really wanted to try it would have worked, since people say to just try, so you must not really _want_ to try, so you begin to instead want to want to try. in addition, confronting it in any way brings with it all the anxiety of every past failure, meaning that often, instead of doing something you often fail to do you just close your eyes and hope it'll go away."

bipolar,anxiety,1188,"""1) nothing makes you happy/all you do is complain/2) everytime we talk, there's conflict, so i'm anxious whenever we speak/ 3) every time you talk, you complain."" i'm afraid of being this unhappy person who pushes people away. anyone hear else? 3 long stories; tldr at the bottom. so in the title, within quotation marks, are what i've heard from people i spent the most time with. 1) my mom, 2) a now-ex boyfriend, and 3) a former friend. 1) my mom kinda blew up in the parking lot of a hospital. the doctor said i didn't need a cough pill for my infection, and would be fine with only the prescription she gave me, and then my mom asked if she could prescribe me with a cough syrup. the doctor agreed to prescribe a strong cough syrup, and i asked if i don't need a cough pill, ""do i need cough syrup?"" the doctor said no, but said ""the medicines won't react with one another,"" and ""if you want a cough syrup, i can prescribe one."" *but i don't.* my cough won't go away (respitory infection) until the steroids kick in, but it will go away. i don't like taking meds i don't need. i'm defensive about this, because every time i have respitory issues, my mom asks the doc for a cough syrup ""for my own good"" and i feel like shit bc it's got some depressive drug in it, and i feel ultra sluggish the morning after i take it. i don't need it so i'm adverse to taking it. my mom says it's ridiculous that i have a cough and won't take a cough syrup, when no cough syrup was prescribed or suggested. the steroids will take it's course. but mothers will be mothers. i just hate taking drugs i don't actually need. (and i'm 18 so i'd think the doctor would have asked me first. guess not.) anyway she called me ungrateful and wouldn't let me speak and i dunno. it hit me. she said: ""i'm better off dead than i am alive to you, because nothing i do as your mother makes you happy."" i wanted to shoot myself in the mouth right there and then, ngl. i know that isn't the (logical) answer to this, but she isn't the only one who's said stuff like this. 2) my ldr boyfriend of two years broke up with me last night. he says he doesn't feel like he can talk to me, because he says offhanded things, and for a while, i didn't address them until months later (which is toxic). and now he feels that he'll fuck up no matter what he does, so what's the point. in the past i've addressed things as they came up and he either made fun of me, got super defensive, or asked ""so what's the problem?"". for example: he didn't speak to me for long periods of time. for like. a year. cancelled majority of skype dates at the last second. i said that i knew he has other obligations, but that still felt a bit emotionally neglected. (being left on read for days and sometimes weeks, not hearing from him for months, reading an ""i love you, too"" from him was rare. i felt like he didn't like me.) but he said that i had no reason to believe that. he had a roommate who made me cry, and he didn't defend me. even if i say that i didn't appreciate a comment, he would just join him. of course, he didn't mean to be rude, and of course he didn't mean to overlook my crying, didn't mean to misunderstand me. but he refused to buy earbuds because of his ""indispoable income"" (even if he went out to drink once a month). which gave his roommate ammo to be a bully. so i mailed my then-bf earbuds and he lost them. it felt as if he didn't put any effort into the relationship, and was justifying himself. when i asked if he wanted to break up, he sounded surprised and confused as to why. said that he loves me. i wasn't angry, just hurt and confused with all the mixed messages. but i said i believed him and ignored my gut. plus, on holidays, he drives six hundred miles in one go to visit me (and his family. so contrary to what he says, i'm not the only reason he comes to the city i live in.) but he said ""you think i wanna see my family? barely anyone there wants to see me. i'md avoiding me, too. avoiding everyone. got in a real bad funk. said uncalled for comments to me and to other people. i understand how depression can be; but that doesn't excuse her from being mean. from playing rough and with scissors (as a seventeen year old). from going out of her way to patronize people. but she put on her snapchat story her suicidal thoughts, talking about how everyone she knows is against her. so i swiped up, let her know that i apologize if i wronged her, and that i want her to be okay. that i don't think anyone is against her. that i am here if she needs to talk. she said that i can't make her pity me, and i was baffled. that she doesn't have the energy for my bullshit. (yikes.) that i shouldn't play nice if i don't feel nicely about a person. (still don't know what's she was talking about but it was childish. but still yikes.) and then she said all i do is complain about my family problems and boyfriend and do nothing to fix it. (that was when i said ""good to know,"" and blocked her. hehe.) it's so funny that she *asked me* what's wrong, didn't accept ""nothing"" for an answer, and then secretly hated when i was open and honest. i thought she was my friend. but i guess only therapists are meant to hear your problems. anyway. i digress. days after i blocked her, she came around me in person. went out of her way to sit next to me. acted fearful, as if i would reject her. took every single chance she got to be overly nice. for example: i was presenting and the class (of 13 people) was talking over me. she stood up, cupped both hands over her mouth, and projected: ""everyone! chris is talking! it is important to hear what they say, so that they can finish their presentation!"" sat down, then grinned at me. the class had the same weirded-out expression as i did. like. ugh. that was so artificial that it hurt me. i have a floridan friend who i tell some of these situations with, and he says it sounds like the other person has some unsolved problems of their own. my therapist said the same thing about all three scenarios. that nothing i complain about is like. ""i'm so sad my dad got me a blue car. i wanted a red one."" y'know? like the problems that bother me are literally ""so i'm homeless and don't know where i'm sleeping tonight "" or ""i got 27 spider bites in my sleep"" or ""my mom is threatening to kick me out and i'm an unemployed student"" or something that can't be given advice, because it's totally out of anyone's control. like when my car got totalled and i kept having flashbacks about the crash throughout the day. i couldn't sleep at night. for weeks. or when three of my classmates died. or when i was in a sexually abusive relationship for six months, got assaulted everyday on school grounds, and didn't tell anyone for eight months. i have flashbacks and awful dreams about *that* one to this day. but i don't say anything until someone asks me what's wrong. and even if they do, i'm reluctant to say so. bc none of this can be hugged better. it's heavy. it's uncomfortable and nobody wants to hear it. those are the only things that get to me. those are the things i go to therapy for. but my therapist doesn't believe in dwelling on (talking about) past traumas and griefs. i don't know what anyone wants me to do anymore. do i just let go of *everything*? i do not exagerrate; these things happened in the same twelve months. i'm not trying to excuse my complaints, but, yikes. i don't know what to make of any of this. anyway. tldr: nobody i open up to stick around. are all of these situations like. situations where both parties have made acceptable mistakes in handling their situation? or am i this unhappy person who makes people miserable because i complain so much? am i ungrateful? am i being crazy for saying the things i do? does anyone else hear statements like these from people who see you the most? it's times like these that makes self destructive behavior so easy."

depression,bipolar,1347,"if you feel shitty, help someone else not feel shitty. kinda shitty advice. but i'll start with some backstory. i'm on mobile so forgive me.

ptsd,depression,1392,"has anyone else tried a weighted blanket to help them sleep? hello, i just got a weighted blanket and was trying it for a month to help me sleep. i was sleeping amazing with it for 2 weeks, (i'm 5'9, weigh 140lbs, male 27 year old just fyi) but then started getting a pain in my chest when i was sleeping. i was loving the blanket so much i just ignored the pain hoping it wmb and in panic and it was horrible. i basically need the weighted blanket now, i can tell i am addicted to it, but i need to find some way to avoid the chest pain. could a lighter blanket be better? i'm also going to try having it only on my legs and feet tonight. maybe that could work. brainstorming, thanks for reading this and if you have advice it would be appreciated."
bipolar,adhd,1394,"thanks dad, it's always nice to be reminded i'm a failure. [rant] [long] i gotta vent. dad, you've been giving mixed compliments for the past week. backhanded praise and shit. ""i don't care if you fail, i care if you try."" too fucking bad dad, i care more if i fail than if i try, and i get that that doesn't get me anywhere; it feels pretty shitty to be reminded my ridiculous rejection sensitivity makes me a terrible person. fine, impedes my success. you didn't call me a terrible person. but that's what i'm getting at. the rejection sensitivity. what amounted to ""your not trying for the sake of avoiding getting hurt disappoints and irritates me"" turned into ""you're a terrible person."" or maybe i took it to mean ""you're broken."" i often think i am. how do you think it feels when i submit 10 job applications and my brain does the same thing about not hearing back? how do you think it feels to be constantly looking at jobs trying to balance what i'm qualified for, what won't be soul-crushingly mind-numbing, and what will actually move me forward in life? and then after beating myself up to get myself to start and continue that process, getting discouraged either not hearing back or hearing i didn't get the job. and then there of performing work and am now telling myself ""you're gonna be the lazy drug using social security beneficiary nobody wants to get their money"" while i tell myself i don't deserve it because i feel like a liar. but you know what? it may hurt, **but i take it on for you**. because i acknowledge my debilitating fear of trying on the job front and would rather take on shame than let my failure to launch weigh you down. when i was growing up, i used to tell myself ""no one can hurt you more than your own family."" i think that's still true for me today. thanks dad. *do you know why i changed therapists after you got your cancer diagnosis?* **i wanted to make sure you'd be proud of me before you died.** i sure as hell don't feel like you are right now. tl;dr: my dad hurt me and pissed me off by telling me he doesn't feel like i try and expressing frustration at how much time i put into videogames (where i can at least feel successful at **something**) when i spent less time on videogames today than half of what i spend most days in general. seriously, videogaming and weight loss are the only two things i've succeeded at since graduation. maybe not dying, too, but i don't think that should count. good to know i'm a disappointment."
bipolar,anxiety,1399,"social media? facebook seriously stresses me out. does anyone else struggle with social media? i have a hard time staying connected to friends and family because the things people post can be serious triggers for me. it doesn't matter if i'm upcycling or downcycling, something is bound to either agitate or depress me. sometimes i go on binges of unfollowing people. that doesn't help because then i don't have those connections and my feed fills up with promotede relationships. i have my immediate family, and a couple of close friends (that's funny. i haven't seen them in literally a year and a half) but everyone else is an acquaintance at best. i don't even talk to my mother unless i have to, and that's after we've mended our relationship (as much as possible at this point). i'm not asking for advice, i just want to know that i'm not alone in feeling like this. do others have the same experiences? can you share some?"
anxiety,depression,1404,"i'm 25 and i'm tired. tired of knowing who i am, but not what i want to be. tired of society deciding where i should be at in life and what i should be doing. tired of feeling like all i've done is waste my time not knowing what to do. tired of being told to make a difference in the world. tireat. tired of looking at others achievements and feeling perpetually inferior. tired of feeling like i'm in some race that i'm losing. tired of self doubt. tired of this never-ending cycle. i'm exhausted and i don't know what to do about it. does anyone else feel this way? if so, what did you do?"
anxiety,depression,1409,"i'm pathetic... i'm 25, no friends, living with my parents, struggling to finish school - i feel like i don't have any coping mechanisms anymore? anyone been here at my age? the older i get, the worse i seem to be at, i don't know, functioning in general. i used to be really sociable, have plenty of friends, i did well in school, had hobbies and interests - i was weird, but enough people liked me that i didn't think about it. after high school it was like the blinders were taken off and i started to see all these things about myself that i really, really hated. i started struggling a lot in social situations, i flunked out of a really good university, i couldn't hold a job, i gradually lost contact with my friends... i was a mess. don't see how to salvage any of that from what i've let myself become. i think a big part of my problems is that i'm so used to trying and failing that i'm afraid that's the only outcome if i try again. i look at myself and think ""i've given up,"" because i have. i don't want to! but i don't know how to make life work for me anymore. i don't know how to connect with people. i go out somewhere and it's impossible to think or talk clearly through the static in my head that makes me nauseous and stutter and my heart pound. what kind of a life is one where you can't even talk to someone without turning into an idiot or crying after? i can't function like this. i'll never be able to work like this. has anyone overcome a similar situation?"
ptsd,depression,1422,"does anyone else have phases of absolute isolation and rejection? i have this regularly and destroyed my social life once again a while back. i pushed away all people i love and lost basically every human conne any empathy left in me. i don't think it's ever going to be any other way, so i don't care anymore. i'm starting to think that i should stay in this totally emotionless state just to stop hurting my loved ones."
ptsd,depression,1424,"what being ""numb"" feels like to me. this is how i feel when i'm numb. i go from on edge to completely shut down. there is no in between. it's been like this most of my life. i don't know anything else, so why does it hurt so much. my vision is narrow. the darkness creeps in from the sides, my focus is obscured and gray. the fltreats within, somewhere deep, primal, eternal accepting the return to where it came from. now the only difference, i arrived here on my own. maybe my captors live inside. they penetrated into my bones now, they inflict death from within. i force my fingers to feel the cold beneath me, they are no longer here, but neither am i."
anxiety,depression,1427,"motivational speakers: do they upset anyone else? i just saw a motivational speech tonight. the speech was fine, good advice, well written. but i left it feeling so hopeless and almost in tears. here's this guy who's wealthy, driven, positive, and fit previous ones. i feel like a fucking negative nancy and that by not fixing that *right now,* i'm sabotaging my own life. i don't feel motivated right now. i sort of want to curl up into a ball. does anyone else react this way to motivational speeches?"
depression,anxiety,1430,"i always type out comments on how relate to someone and their situation, only to delete them and keep it to myself. i don't know if it's because i feel they won't care, like i'm being annoying, or if i realize i simply don't want to share. i just know i do it."
none,adhd,1433,"whats a nicer way to say ""you shouldnt worry about my marks, just focus on your own"" maybe this way of saying it is fine, but when people ask around and compare test scores, i genuinely believe and want to tell people that they shouldn't focus on what other people scored but focus on themselves and their own work. i don't want to sound too formal or even rude since i am a student. so how should i reply to people asking whatever test mark i received?"

ptsd,anxiety,1440,i got a phone call today and im getting a call to sort out a counsellor im so happy man. i was kinda a dumb teenager who figured i could “do it myself” but now as a adult i know i can’t do that so i’m super excited to be getting help. ahhhhhh
adhd,anxiety,1446,"i wish i could sleep so bad it makes me want to cry i just came to complain honestly. i’ve been trying to fall asleep for hours and i have to be up early and the fact that i have to wake up tomorrow morning stresses me out and then it makes it harder for me to sleep. i get so frustrated that people can just “go to sleep.” every time i put my phone away and close my eyes my mind just races with thoughts. sometimes anxious thoguhts, hypotheticalcalm down. it’s not even think it’s a panic attack, i can really only just describe it as just “one of those nights” and it’s torture. not to mention i’ve had like 2 different songs mentally playing while i’ve tried to write this and lost track of myself while writing this post about three times. anyways thanks for reading if u made it to the end. it’s just comforting knowing that i’m not the only one bc it genuinely feels like i’m going crazy."
ptsd,anxiety,1448,my emotional support dog is dead i can't function. i have a test in the morning and a final exam thursday that i won't be attending. she ran away and got hit by a car and died. i don't know how i'm going to go on. i can't live without her.
bipolar,depression,1457,"on feeling broken and undeserving of romantic love i was recently pming with someone about relationships, heartbreak, and feeling broken and picked up on a shared sentiment. that our mental illnesses made us less deserving of love from healthy people. which my rational mind tells me is total bullshit, but it's still a sentiment i have to put effort into rejecting. it's no secret i've been investing serious time into online dating, but i think it's progress on my part that most of the time i don't feel like my mental illness disqualifies me from relationships with healthy people. i still feel like i'll be better understood by people who experience depression and whatnot and like my issues will be less of a burden to someone with their own struggles for me to give bed too and i'm no more broken than any ""normie."" *how many of you have struggled to feel like it's okay to have relationships with healthy people, and of those of you who have, what if anything has helped you chip away at that feeling?* as broken as i've felt and as flawed as i've been, i've never been broken and i've never stopped being worth loving. there have been things about me that have made it harder to love me, like my former bmi of nearly 40 as a barrier to that kind of attracted attention, but even then i was sometimes shown that kind of love. **however broken you may feel and however unlovable you may feel, you are most certainly mistaken. you are complete and just as flawed as everyone else and worthy of love, however hard it may be to find that love.**"
bipolar,depression,1458,"my father died today. or yesterday, maybe. im beginning a 20h odyssey halfway across the world to get to my father's funeral in time. the man died young, and it came out of nowhere. just numb right now, flashes of memories. going to try and stay sane for the family. wish me luck."
bipolar,ptsd,1476,"i want to keep faking stability and normalcy i have lied to my friends and family for a very long time. it goes beyond the ""how are you?"" and ""fine, thank you"" dialogue. i lived with a smile on my face and i told myself that i was strong. i recently had an episode where i couldn't fake it anymore. i became really really sick. and now, the people i love are aer, and i could never hurt her like that. my mom looked so shocked. i want to keep lying and putting up a face. but the truth is that i'm exhausted and really tired of acting like someone i'm not. and i know that my family and friends are asking questions because they want to understand and help me, but i want them to continue seeing me as ""smiley joojoobar."""
