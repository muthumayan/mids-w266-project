ptsd,anxiety,4,"i‚Äôve tried celexa, wellbutrin, and zoloft with no luck due to how hard i was hit by the side effects. i was told that since i‚Äôve had three failed attempts, my ins cbd juice, and- holy shit- the difference! this has changed everything in less than 24 hours and i am so humbled and grateful at the peace i‚Äôm finally getting. üôåüèº"
ptsd,anxiety,5,"*maria sighed. ‚Äúit is sometimes easier to be punished for something than it is to be a victim of random cruelty. as long as ingeth can tell herself that her voice was taken from her because she committed some sin, then she has some control of it, you understand? otherwise it was simply a terrible thing that happened. and ihe seventh bride, t. kingfisher* i really struggle with control. i also don't like being a victim, feeling like a victim, or admitting that i did everything i could have. this helped me see a different perspective. i'm still puzzling over this paragraph in a children's early chapter book like an hour after i came across it."
adhd,anxiety,7,ever since i can remember i've always been an extremely curious person and if i ever overheard someone talking about something like a secret or drama i would be dying to know what they were talking about and beg them to let me know too. right now i find myself absolutely torturing myself over my ex girlfriends in i grew to be such a manipulative person. so am i just nosey or you guys like this too? i also hate hate hate when someone starts to tell me something then says never mind and cuts it off. it can literally ruin the rest of my day if they refuse to tell me what they were gonna say (until i forget about it at least)
ptsd,bipolar,8,"not all that unusual where i work actually. the supervisor i broke down in front of had his own breakdown about 8 years ago. its an engineering company that specializes in large, high risk sort of projects. so lots of crazy hours and stress. without realizing it, i went something like a week without sleep. i was supposeannot be on most meds), and various other things. nope....i get a couple of emails detailing the online videos i have to watch.

anxiety,bipolar,14,"a stigma that i‚Äôve noticed in the mental health community... so many people are happy to talk about it and embrace your differences, but oh no.. don‚Äôt have a panic attack in front of them, don‚Äôt seek re-assurance from today‚Äôs anxious thoughts and jitters. this is something that needs changing. it is more than ok for someone with diabetes to be comforted even when they de‚Äôs not all bad, i‚Äôm lucky to have family and a handful of friends that have seen me go though treatments and recovery so know the full spectrum of my issues and do not judge or baby me. i felt like sharing this little rant to hear your thoughts on if you‚Äôve been accepted or told to ‚Äòhide‚Äô symptoms from the public to spare their discomfort... like your doing it on purpose."
adhd,none,22,"edit: i said this as a joke, but that was before i saw just how many people end up owing ridiculous amounts of money. i am 100% going to talk to my university library about this now."

depression,anxiety,36,"everyday in high school i see people who can be engaged in certain classes and discussions out of what seems like interest. sometimes i see or hear about a student who went above and beyond on something. or, at the very least, i notice people who can do work and study for tests reasonably ahead of time. every time i see one of these things i feel jealous, sad, and sometimes almosly interested in any of them. college is coming next year, and i have no idea what i'm going to do, or if i even have the motivation to make it through. it's been difficult enough pretending like i care in high school. any kind of work is just a massive mental chore to get through. if it weren't for my massive anxiety and fear of falling out, i probably wouldn't get anything done."
depression,bipolar,40,"i felt like this very often lately. it's terrifies me. i keep telling myself that this is all just in my head, but is it true? or is it merely a comforting thoungt i am desperately clinging to? (sorry for my terrible english.)"
ptsd,bipolar,42,"too much horrible shit has happened to me in the past few weeks. one of the things i can't tell my parents. i have been going around house to house staying with other people because i want to avoid my parents. due to my other mental health issues, i still live at home at age 27 (i know,pathetic) and i feel like i can't be around them rig bitch to me. didn't care that i couldn't sleep. i had to go to the e.r. (i have medicaid) to get sleeping pills that actually work because she wouldn't return my call after giving my trazedone, which doesn't even work. i'm so angry at everyone. even my therapist who i told my problem to, i don't think he takes me seriously. i'm so tired."
ptsd,bipolar,47,"i know that's a very ""wtf"" topic title, but weird times call for weird celebrations. just googled him for the first time in eons and found new news articles. now i'm just sitting here laughing at how thoroughly he's fucked up his life. probation violation :) actually, twelve of em, but who's counting? **he has** ***nothing*** **left**. he has forfeited a high-paying licensed career, almost a decade of life outside prison now, his well-kozen lives is probably never going to be happy again. :) *was it worth it, my good bitch? would you make the same life choices and still be a degenerate piece of shit...or do you regret it a lil by this point?* i'm just so fucking jazzed at this news. that violent waste of oxygen can eat shit and taste his own karma. **may all the terrible people in your life end up ruining their own lives with their gratuitously awful decisions too :)**"
bipolar,adhd,51,"my doctor recently decided that she thought i was stable enough to start treating my adhd on top of my bp1. she warned me that the medicine could cause me to have a bad reaction and potentially lead to another psychotic episode or something. she started me on a low dose of vyvance but i didn't feel like it was doing anything and i've gradually gone up to the maximum dose. i've been pretty messed up for about a week now though. i also have pretty bad social anxiety and i think the meds are making me manic or mixed manic. i've been very disconnected from other people., paranoid and socially withdrawn. i havnt left my appartment sense saturday. im havingid because i don't want to get admitted again. she's a new doctor and i don't know how she is about this sort of thing. my last dr seemed like he wanted to try and have me admitted ""for observation"" all the time, even when he wanted to try me on new medicine. that's bullshit though because hospitals are safe places where they remove the stress of the outside world. how can they observe if a medicine is working or not if there aren't any factors at play that would cause an episode. i don't know what to do. i won't go in for an unscheduled appointment. the last time i went to an unscheduled appointment for issues i ended up being admitted against my will"

ptsd,bipolar,64,"my dad sent me ""the body keeps the score"" awhile ago but i packed it up or gave it to a friend (can't remember) because i felt like he was trying to not do his part in him being a better person and me feeling safe. ridiculous, i know. i'm working on the suspicion and jumping to conclusions lol. anyway, how many of you found this book helpful? i'm considering looking harder or buying it again."
depression,bipolar,71,i just don't get it. i've been depressed for so many years that i've completely forgotten what it's like to live normally. i can't fathom that there are mentally stable people who live most of their lives as mentally healthy people. i just can't understand it and i hate them.
bipolar,adhd,73,"i was curious what people thought if it so far. the little activities have been interesting, but the questions they ask about if you did this or that on these medications has been somewhat useless to me. i've been on multiple medications for the majority of my adult life, so i don't always remember what caused what. i always assumed the brain fog was related to medication, and i was really kind of sad to find that the disorder causes it."

ptsd,bipolar,113,"for me, i have bought many books and i have spent lots of money on insurance, doctors visits, and medication. a significant area that i haven't invested in is therapy. instead, i have always sought out free therapy which may or may not be effective. so, what about you? what areas have you invested in?"

adhd,none,172,"from an article i just read: &amp;#x200b; *the chaotic, ephemeral eddies under his grandfather's rowboat are a perfect image of nelson's style of thought. i was already taping our conversation, but nelson clearly wanted his own record. not because he was concerned about being quoted correctly, but because his tape recorder and video camera are weapons in an unending battle against amnesia. the inventor suffers from an extreme case of attention deficit disorder, a recently named psychological syndrome whose symptoms include unusual sensitivity to interruption.* *if he is stopped in the middle of anything, he forgets it instantly. only by running his own tape recorder could nelson be confident that his words would not float off, irrecoverably, into the atmosphere.* *nand a filmmaker, but he needed a way to avoid getting lost in the frantic multiplication of associations his brain produced. his great inspiration was to imagine a computer program that could keep track of all the divergent paths of his thinking and writing. to this concept of branching, nonlinear writing, nelson gave the name* *although the concept of hypertext made nelson legendary in programming circles, he is not a programmer. ""i have a terrific math problem,"" nelson said. ""i still can't add up a checkbook: i can add a column of figures five times, get four different answers, and none of them will be right. i'm very accident-prone and extremely impatient. i can't work my macintosh - i have three that are completely unfunctional and one is marginally functional.""*"

bipolar,adhd,527,"i've been having a weird feeling lately, a lot like what i experienced two years ago when i first went off all psych meds. i'd been on medication since i was 11, for more than half my life (most of which only made things worse) and it felt like i was seeing the world for the first time. i had missed out on so many normal teenage/early 20s experiences and there was just so much i hadn't figured out. but while i'm still not sure my medication is even helping me, the one thing i do know is that quitting drinking has given me a similar sense of clarity. not that i was drung your medication as prescribed but still abusing substances, i'll be honest and say... you're probably going to have a rough time. while i don't think complete abstinence is necessary for everyone, i feel like just not drinking at all makes things a whole lot easier for me. of course alcohol is pretty much unavoidable in our culture... and yeah, it does get lonely at times. but i don't have to stress my brain thinking about when i'm crossing the line. and that just makes everything so much easier. believe me, it's better on the other side. i'm doing good. you will too."

""i don't care if you fail, i care if you try."" too fucking bad dad, i care more if i fail than if i try, and i get that that doesn't get me anywhere; it feels pretty shitty to be reminded my ridiculous rejection sensitivity makes me a terrible person. fine, impedes my success. you didn't call me a terrible person. but that's what i'm getting at. the rejection sensitivity. what amounted to ""your not trying for the sake of avoiding getting hurt disappoints and irritates me"" turned into ""you're a terrible person."" or maybe i took it to mean ""you're broken."" i often think i am. how do you think it feels when i submit 10 job applications and my brain does the same thing about not hearing back? how do you think it feels to be constantly looking at jobs trying to balance what i'm qualified for, what won't be soul-crushingly mind-numbing, and what will actually move me forward in life? and then after beating myself up to get myself to start and continue that process, getting discouraged either not hearing back or hearing i didn't get the job. and then there's: what if i actually here back? interviews are std am now telling myself ""you're gonna be the lazy drug using social security beneficiary nobody wants to get their money"" while i tell myself i don't deserve it because i feel like a liar. but you know what? it may hurt, **but i take it on for you**. because i acknowledge my debilitating fear of trying on the job front and would rather take on shame than let my failure to launch weigh you down. when i was growing up, i used to tell myself ""no one can hurt you more than your own family."" i think that's still true for me today. thanks dad. *do you know why i changed therapists after you got your cancer diagnosis?* **i wanted to make sure you'd be proud of me before you died.** i sure as hell don't feel like you are right now. tl;dr: my dad hurt me and pissed me off by telling me he doesn't feel like i try and expressing frustration at how much time i put into videogames (where i can at least feel successful at **something**) when i spent less time on videogames today than half of what i spend most days in general. seriously, videogaming and weight loss are the only two things i've succeeded at since graduation. maybe not dying, too, but i don't think that should count. good to know i'm a disappointment."

ptsd,depression,822,i'm a firefighter. i hate when people ask me about the worst things i've seen. it's like they want me to re-live the most terrifying or heartbreaking moments of my life over and over again for their amusement. i already do that often enough. &amp;#x200b; anyone have a productive way to respond?
anxiety,depression,823,"so the title sums it up. i'm almost 28, all my friends are engaged, married or have a clatter of children. i have never even had a boyfriend in my life. i've had ""friend with benefits"" who in reality were not friends and have not benefitted me. i can see now i was used a practice girl before they moved onto women they actually care about. i have social anxiety and hate myself so expect others to hate me too. things like eye contact are very difficult. i use alcohol as a tool to try and be fun but it never really works out. not e first time in my life, he dumped me before i got that far. i'm not angry, i don't blame him, he just didn't feel the same way i do. it's left me absolutely broken. i believe im not good enough for anyone and don't see the point in going on anymore. i just go through the motions every day without feeling anything. i am on meds and see a doctor regularly but nothing helps. i tried counselling and could not talk. i have a history involving suicide and sexual assault and so trust is hard for me. i don't know where to go from here."
bipolar,anxiety,824,"so in the title, within quotation marks, are what i've heard from people i spent the most time with. 1) my mom, 2) a now-ex boyfriend, and 3) a former friend. 1) my mom kinda blew up in the parking lot of a hospital. the doctor said i didn't need a cough pill for my infection, and would be fine with only the prescription she gave me, and then my mom asked if she could prescribe me with a cough syrup. the doctor agreed to prescribe a strong cough syrup, and i asked if i don't need a cough pill, ""do i need cough syrup?"" the doctor said no, but said ""the medicines won't react with one another,"" and ""if you want a cough syrup, i can prescribe one."" *but i don't.* my cough won't go away (respitory infection) until the steroids kick in, but it will go away. i don't like taking meds i don't need. i'm defensive about this, because every time i have respitory issues, my mom asks the doc for a cough syrup ""for my own good"" and i feel like shit bc it's got some depressive drug in it, and i feel ultra sluggish the morning after i take it. i don't need it so i'm adverse to taking it. my mom says it's ridiculous that i have a cough and won't take a cough syrup, when no cough syrup was prescribed or suggested. the steroids will take it's course. but mothers will be mothers. i just hate taking drugs i don't actually need. (and i'm 18 so i'd think the doctor would have asked me first. guess not.) anyway she called me ungrateful and wouldn't let me speak and i dunno. it hit me. she said: ""i'm better off dead than i am alive to you, because nothing i do as your mother makes you happy."" i wanted to shoot myself in the mouth right there and then, ngl. i know that isn't the (logical) answer to this, but she isn't the only one who's said stuff like this. 2) my ldr boyfriend of two years broke up with me last night. he says he doesn't feel like he can talk to me, because he says offhanded things, and for a while, i didn't address them until months later (which is toxic). and now he feels that he'll fuck up no matter what he does, so what's the point. in the past i've addressed things as they came up and he either made fun of me, got super defensive, or asked ""so what's the problem?"". for example: he didn't speak to me for long periods of time. for like. a year. cancelled majority of skype dates at the last second. i said that i knew he has other obligations, but that still felt a bit emotionally neglected. (being left on read for days and sometimes weeks, not hearing from him for months, reading an ""i love you, too"" from him was rare. i felt like he didn't like me.) but he said that i had no reason to believe that. he had a roommate who made me cry, and he didn't defend me. even if i say that i didn't appreciate a comment, he would just join him. of course, he didn't mean to be rude, and of course he didn't mean to overlook my crying, didn't mean to misunderstand me. but he refused to buy earbuds because of his ""indispoable income"" (even if he went out to drink once a month). which gave his roommate ammo to be a bully. so i mailed my then-bf earbuds and he lost them. it felt as if he didn't put any effort into the relationship, and was justifying himself. when i asked if he wanted to break up, he sounded surprised and confused as to why. said that he loves me. i wasn't angry, just hurt and confused with all the mixed messages. but i said i believed him and ignored my gut. plus, on holidays, he drives six hundred miles in one go to visit me (and his family. so contrary to what he says, i'm not the only reason he comes to the city i live in.) but he said ""you think i wanna see my family? barely anyone there wants to see me. i'm driving for nine hours straight just so see you. of course i love you."" he gave multiple examples of his responsibilities, asked if i understood, and still asked what the problem is. i couldn't teents to me and to other people. i understand how depression can be; but that doesn't excuse her from being mean. from playing rough and with scissors (as a seventeen year old). from going out of her way to patronize people. but she put on her snapchat story her suicidal thoughts, talking about how everyone she knows is against her. so i swiped up, let her know that i apologize if i wronged her, and that i want her to be okay. that i don't think anyone is against her. that i am here if she needs to talk. she said that i can't make her pity me, and i was baffled. that she doesn't have the energy for my bullshit. (yikes.) that i shouldn't play nice if i don't feel nicely about a person. (still don't know what's she was talking about but it was childish. but still yikes.) and then she said all i do is complain about my family problems and boyfriend and do nothing to fix it. (that was when i said ""good to know,"" and blocked her. hehe.) it's so funny that she *asked me* what's wrong, didn't accept ""nothing"" for an answer, and then secretly hated when i was open and honest. i thought she was my friend. but i guess only therapists are meant to hear your problems. anyway. i digress. days after i blocked her, she came around me in person. went out of her way to sit next to me. acted fearful, as if i would reject her. took every single chance she got to be overly nice. for example: i was presenting and the class (of 13 people) was talking over me. she stood up, cupped both hands over her mouth, and projected: ""everyone! chris is talking! it is important to hear what they say, so that they can finish their presentation!"" sat down, then grinned at me. the class had the same weirded-out expression as i did. like. ugh. that was so artificial that it hurt me. i have a floridan friend who i tell some of these situations with, and he says it sounds like the other person has some unsolved problems of their own. my therapist said the same thing about all three scenarios. that nothing i complain about is like. ""i'm so sad my dad got me a blue car. i wanted a red one."" y'know? like the problems that bother me are literally ""so i'm homeless and don't know where i'm sleeping tonight "" or ""i got 27 spider bites in my sleep"" or ""my mom is threatening to kick me out and i'm an unemployed student"" or something that can't be given advice, because it's totally out of anyone's control. like when my car got totalled and i kept having flashbacks about the crash throughout the day. i couldn't sleep at night. for weeks. or when three of my classmates died. or when i was in a sexually abusive relationship for six months, got assaulted everyday on school grounds, and didn't tell anyone for eight months. i have flashbacks and awful dreams about *that* one to this day. but i don't say anything until someone asks me what's wrong. and even if they do, i'm reluctant to say so. bc none of this can be hugged better. it's heavy. it's uncomfortable and nobody wants to hear it. those are the only things that get to me. those are the things i go to therapy for. but my therapist doesn't believe in dwelling on (talking about) past traumas and griefs. i don't know what anyone wants me to do anymore. do i just let go of *everything*? i do not exagerrate; these things happened in the same twelve months. i'm not trying to excuse my complaints, but, yikes. i don't know what to make of any of this. anyway. tldr: nobody i open up to stick around. are all of these situations like. situations where both parties have made acceptable mistakes in handling their situation? or am i this unhappy person who makes people miserable because i complain so much? am i ungrateful? am i being crazy for saying the things i do? does anyone else hear statements like these from people who see you the most? it's times like these that makes self destructive behavior so easy."
depression,bipolar,826,"kinda shitty advice. but i'll start with some backstory. i'm on mobile so forgive me. (this will be kinda rambly) i was diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety disorder after i checked into a psychiatric hospital a few years back, but i always felt as i grew up that something was wrong. when i went to go meet my biological mother (who is very bipolar) when i was 18 things started to click with me that i needed to figure out a way to find meaning. it didn't help that my step-mom was an abusive cunt. so overall i kinda suck at being a person.(still do) anyways, i've struggled with constantly feeling down, and also feeling a whole lotta shit i didn't really understand. because of this i turned to weed and alcohol when i was 15. went through a few phases of drinking hard, but really weed was my poison of choice(still dont think it's bad but that's for another sub). again anyways because of the plant i kinda regained a sense of what it meant to be a healthy functioning member of society, but it was  pay the rent, things get complicated with family, with work, with life. and all of it together makes me wanna opt out. but then i think of leaving him by himself to deal with it himself and what a living hell that would be. even if i cant do much, ill do what i can till i can't. because if i dont that would make me sadder than anything i can ever encounter in my life. my point is that out there there are strong, amazing, incredibly intelligent and driven people, who do this shit alone. while feeling everything. and its heart breaking. my dad spent his life trying to make me feel welcome when every fiber of my being says i don't belong on this earth. the least i can do is gtfo bed and try to do something. even if my battle that day is just to brush my teeth. so that he can see a good looking smile that he made. to make him feel just a little better. that's my part, my mission. thats what gets me up. there are people that can use your help, and you owe it to them. but that s just my opinion."
bipolar,anxiety,827,"it's happening again. time has slowed by the tiniest of fractions all the infinite of paths have become slightly less infinite, and slightly less impossible impossibility is eroding...again yesterday's tasks, which seemed so heavy, so futile, so devoid of hope are now infused with the knowledge that all tasks are as light as you make them, as important as you deem them, and hoping that this feeling can stay it's happening again. time is reminding me that it can't cease to exist the click of time's tongue can change it's tone depending on how i choose to unwrap it's gifts like friendship, it can never leave you, it can never speed up, it can never enour nothingness my ego claims the well-known eyes are kinder with their gaze, but it knows better they know better i know better. it's happening again. the arena of my mind changes with each breath, with each thought from challenge to shelter to prison to dead end my arena transforms until it doesn't until it's a step behind until it's steps behind it's happening again. my mind cannot keep up with my arena my arena will not keep up with my mind the clock ticks slower now until it doesn't. time is up. the focus is narrowed. the narrowed is focused. this is all gibberish nonsense...time has changed it all. impossibility is growing. it's happened again."

depression,anxiety,844,"latest update; if the majority wants me to go into detail in everything of my experience from that night on, the other side and such. id be happy to, i need motivation and comfort to do so. well ive never been on this website. i just googled my thoughts thorough and sorta winded up here. 29 hours ago i ate 30 tablets which of brand i will not state due to security, i drank 10liters of beer, one bowl of hash and said bye. i met my childhood friend, he said i was more than welcome, he missed me, we'd have fun. i instantly thought i was trippin on some sort of marked dope. my long lost friend told me about times i forgot by far, in details, things that i miss. i felt like i was hanging out with him for weeks, when suddenly i saw an old woman which i clearly knew (not going further into details but she is well known by our family as a psychic). she told me to say loudly if i was happy at the moment, which i did. we sat and spoke for what felt ly first language, i just see patterns in my head to how it should sound due to my autism. lets start again, i've already fallen back twice. adrenaline popped somewhere in my shoulder to get me back last time, not due to the fact id wanna die. but i've gotten severe damage from the attempt which the doctor said would make life ""different"" for now im doing okay, im tired. really really tired. i feel empty and for the moment completely alone. doc put on donnie darko today, i watched the whole thing thinking about depression and family for some reason. i've seen it a gazillion times but that's the first step to ""different"" i guess, im not familiar with the feelings i got at the moment and im gonna keep posting daily (as far as my body and mind lets me). for the moment i can barely do it, fyi i would never even start typing on here today if it wasn't for all the support and heroism in mankind. you are all my glowing angels, thank you. -xx dxty 3m"

adhd,anxiety,909,"video games, weed, watching porn, eating fatty foods, drinking, etc. these are all things i find very hard to control. when i smoke a bit of weed i crave more instantly and i don't stop smoking until i'm baked out of my mind. whenever i'm feeling bad i start overeating, which leads to me feeling worse, which leads to more overeating. whenever i feel bored (which is quite often) i play video games. this leads to me using only video games for pleasure and to esccult emotions, and i dull myself with unhealthy behaviours, instead of just accepting the emotions and processing them in a healthy way. when i stop using these behaviours the negative thoughts and emotions start hitting me very hard. but probably that's just a phase you have to go through, to get out better on the otherside. are there others who struggle with balancing life like me? if you've found a solution, please elaborate. is this just a discipline thing?"

anxiety,ptsd,1234,"my wife passed out from a panic attack yesterday in the theatre while we were watching *a quiet place*. i was so scared and didn't know what to do. about an hour into the movie, there's a scene where someone steps on a nail. it wasn't even very gory, but i guess it triggered some bad memories for her. a few seconds after that scene, my wife's arm started twitching kind of like a seizure. at the same time, she started making sounds like she was snoring or maybe choking. when i looked at her, her head was lolled to the side and her eyes were closed. not realizing what was happening, i nudged her a bit, thinking she had fallen asleep. when her head rolled to the other side and there wasn't any other response my concern sky-rocketed. i took her head in my hands and gently shook her a little bit trying to wake her up. her eyes partially opened, and i could see her pupils were looking up like when you roll your eyes. there was no other response. i tilted her head forward and the ""snoring"" sound stopped, but she was still unconscious. at this point, about half a minute or so had passeder feel safe. i tried to just hold her and comfort her. after about a half hour she was doing better. i felt so helpless when she was unconscious. it's very scary when you suddenly realize your loved one is having a medical emergency. later in the evening, she revealed to me that when she was a teenager, she had an abusive boyfriend that would rape her, cut her with a scalpel, and poke her with needles. sick stuff like that i guess. she wouldn't say much more about it than that. i am angry. not at her, but at the thought some sicko did this to her. and i hurt. i grieve that she has experienced something so traumatic it causes this type of thing. she agreed we will get her into some therapy. she needs healing that i never knew she needed. i also know this isn't about me, but i feel a bit hurt this is just now coming out. we've been married about 5 years, and i never knew this stuff. what else don't i know? i don't know what type of advice i'm looking for. how can i be there for her? how can i help? what do i do if this happens again? did i do the right thing both during and after?"

bipolar,adhd,1276,i promised a friend i'd make a poster and a pin the tail on the donkey game for his kid's birthday. then i forgot - because my own kid had a school project that i threw all my free time this week into. i remembered thursday at work abofeel stupid for this. i also had a twelve hour work day yesterday and it's a job that requires tons of running. i hope they're happy with it all. if they're not... i guess i'll just have to accept that and know that i gave it my best!!!

anxiety,ptsd,1286,"i feel like i've become a shit ton better as a person, but there are those nights that make me relive all those bad moments and i beat myself up so much that i get seriously messed up. what i wouldn't give to go back and do it all over the right way again..that way, i might've made better friends who would've lasted through maybe? or maybe these experiences, they've made me better as a person? they've shaped me? i dont know at this point."

bipolar,depression,1292,"i feel like every time i have a conversation or try to, i‚Äôll have em in the first half, but by the second i imagine the -2 social points from sims. it‚Äôs not just imaginary. after i get that feeling, i notice the people from those situations liking me less. i‚Äô at me and my gut is telling me to stop and continuing on until i‚Äôve ruined the atmosphere. telling a joke that is insensitive/being annoying/rambling/etc it feels awful because it does numbers on my reputation. it gets in the way of dating and making friends."
bipolar,depression,1297,i love how easy it is to go from not giving one shit about what other people think to giving all the shits. the paranoia that people are talking about me.t thought i really was just a horrible person. at least now i know that i just have a broken brain and not just a completely broken/ defective as a person.

ptsd,bipolar,1334,"i (26f) don‚Äôt want to go into a lot of detail because i‚Äôm still processing everything. i had a psychotic break last week after a huge trigger. last wednesday i drove up to a cabin in the woods and swallowed a bunch of pills until the cops showed up, called by my parents after they tracked me down. they took me to the nearest hospital where i actually escaped then was brought back again by the police out looking for me. i‚Äôve literally lost count of how many attempts i‚Äôve made, but i know it‚Äôs in the 20 range. most of them occurred in a 3 month periodanything similar? how did you cope? maybe if i just hide in bed the rest of my life i‚Äôll live to be 80. she said i can do it, but i need to realize the harsh truth of the matter that i have already beat the odds too many times. i feel unfixable. will i be broken forever? will i live until i‚Äôm 80? i really hope so, but now i‚Äôm not so sure. attempting suicide became a coping mechanism for me years ago but i thought after a year and a half of therapy i could go the rest of my life without an attempt. i don‚Äôt know what i‚Äôm looking for, any help i guess."

ptsd,anxiety,1343,ive come to the situation where i have a brand new partner who wants to hold my hand and this is coming to a head for me again. the second this happens i start to cry and they get put off. they ask if im uncomfortable literally every time no matter the person and i have to say no because its not normal. ive tried to muscle through it but the moment the hand holding gets to hand rubbing i cry again and so on. im 19 what do you think i should do? understandably all of my relationships are very short
ptsd,adhd,1353,"i saw your post on weighted blankets and how it can help you sleep. it normally takes me over an hour to fall asleep and normally only sleep about 4-5 hours a night. i gave it a shot and bought a weighted blanket and for the past 2 weeks i have fallen asleep faster than my husband and sleep a glorious 7-8 hours straight. so thank you who ever posted that, because hat was what i clearly needed."

anxiety,bipolar,1372,"the older i get, the worse i seem to be at, i don't know, functioning in general. i used to be really sociable, have plenty of friends, i did well in school, had hobbies and interests - i was weird, but enough people liked me that i didn't think about it. after high school it was like the blinders were taken off and i started to see all these things about myself that i really, really hated. i started struggling a lot in social situations, i flunked out of a really good university, i couldn't hold a job, i gradually lost contact with my friends... i was a mess. but i got back up. it was a little harder than before but i still had enough momentum to keep going. i moved back to my ollet myself become. i think a big part of my problems is that i'm so used to trying and failing that i'm afraid that's the only outcome if i try again. i look at myself and think ""i've given up,"" because i have. i don't want to! but i don't know how to make life work for me anymore. i don't know how to connect with people. i go out somewhere and it's impossible to think or talk clearly through the static in my head that makes me nauseous and stutter and my heart pound. what kind of a life is one where you can't even talk to someone without turning into an idiot or crying after? i can't function like this. i'll never be able to work like this. has anyone overcome a similar situation?"

bipolar,depression,1405,"i was recently pming with someone about relationships, heartbreak, and feeling broken and picked up on a shared sentiment. that our mental illnesses made us less deserving of love from healthy people. which my rational mind tells me is total bullshit, but it's still a sentiment i have to put effort into rejecting. it's no secret i've been investing serious time into online dating, but i think it's progress on my part that most of the time i don't feel like my mental illness disqualifies me from relationships with healthy people. i still feel like i'll be better understood by people who experience depression and whatnot and like my issues will be less of a burden to someone with their own struggles for me to give back to, but as i was thinking abouto more broken than any ""normie."" *how many of you have struggled to feel like it's okay to have relationships with healthy people, and of those of you who have, what if anything has helped you chip away at that feeling?* as broken as i've felt and as flawed as i've been, i've never been broken and i've never stopped being worth loving. there have been things about me that have made it harder to love me, like my former bmi of nearly 40 as a barrier to that kind of attracted attention, but even then i was sometimes shown that kind of love. **however broken you may feel and however unlovable you may feel, you are most certainly mistaken. you are complete and just as flawed as everyone else and worthy of love, however hard it may be to find that love.**"

depression,bipolar,1424,i can't stand how people these days are patting themselves on the back for spreading awareness about mental health. there is still so much farther to go. we have not made nearly enough progress for complacency.
