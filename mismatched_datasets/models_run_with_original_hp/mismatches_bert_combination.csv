none,bipolar,11,"how to reply to ‚Äúmood‚Äù? basically i commented on something in a group chat and a girl replied ‚Äúmood‚Äù. now i know that means ‚Äúi feel the same‚Äù, i‚Äôm just wondering if i need to reply to that somehow? if i don‚Äôt say anything would it be awkward?"
bipolar,depression,29,"cried for the 1st time in over 5 years title says it all. i was bombarded this morning by my boss, essentially belittling me in front of the entire office. i sucked up like the man i am, and sat down belmost forgot how that felt. i ran to the back half of the office, stood out in secluded section of the warehouse and wept. granted it was for only about 30 seconds, i haven't felt such relief in so long."
bipolar,anxiety,40,my new cat i got a cat almost a month ago. i got him because cats have been shown to help with anxiety. his favorite thing to do was to lay on my chest and purr while knocking my phone out of my hand to have me pet him. n hour ago. i don't understand how life has given me this many hardships in my life and especially 2 days before my birthday. all i wanted to do was spend it with him. i really do not know what to do. i'm just really sad.
anxiety,depression,49,"anyone feels like they‚Äôre always being lied to? i constantly feel like i‚Äôm being lied to. i overanalyze things, my brain always finds a way to twisted things people say so it seems like a lie. my head hurts and i often cry. things started to feel like this since i was being cheated on 6 years ago."
adhd,bipolar,50,"do you guys find puns extraordinarily hilarious? while most people i know can barely muster a tired smirk, even the lamest ones keep me snorting forever. just saw someone here say ""copypasta"" and it had me rolling for minutes. and i'm actually in a horrible mood."
adhd,depression,71,"i just want to say thank you to all of the subscribers of this subreddit. as emotional as it sounds, i never felt understood until i found you guys. seriously. i never realized other people struggled with as many of the same things that i struggle with. finding this community helped me realize that i'm not alone, and helped me better understand my mental illness. i am so grateful."

none,adhd,104,"what grammar rule is that?? i constantly bump into different strange uses of ""would"" that i just can't understand. for example ""i tried to unlock the front door, but the door wouldn't open"" this is a situation that happened in finished in the past. this is not a hypothetical situation. ""would"" here doesn't mean a habitual past action. ""would"" here doesn't express willingness to do something. isn't it supposed to be ""i tried to unlock the front door but the door didn't open"". whyyyyy?"
adhd,none,112,"do you struggle with calculating basic stuff in your head? like im taking maths now, so i can study computer engineering. i need more time than others to understand stuff but i get by somehow. anyways, i never get good at head calculating. like i can solve pretty complex stuff on paper, but struggle with stuff like 17+7-3 in my head. i actually count my fingers."

depression,adhd,133,"i always type out comments on how relate to someone and their situation, only to delete them and keep it to myself. i don't know if it's because i feel they won't care, like i'm being annoying, or if i realize i simply don't want to share. i just know i do it."
depression,adhd,137,"you ever just feel like shit whenever someone asks how your day went, or what you have been up to recently? like you're put on the spot, and suddenly feel this pressure to sound interesting because you realize how boring your routine must appear to a third party. suddenly realizing youfacade cracks. maybe they'll realize one day that i've never actually finished any project in which i've expressed interest. i already know that i will like myself a lot more, have better conversations, and more fulfilling relationships if i can just manage to flip this balance of time."
none,adhd,147,"let's be clear: nobody is getting laid off due to obamacare. their employers are just angry that they lost the largest tax subsidy in history. conservatives always talk about personal . conservatives hate talking about reducing costs. when they say that, what they mean is that they want to pass the burden to the taxpayer, and keep the resulting profit for themselves."

anxiety,depression,157,"made a phone call - didn't die. i ordered a pizza online but after i submitted it i realized i put the wrong toppings. normally i'd just accept my fate and pick off the mushrooms i accidentally ordered, but this time i picked up the phone right away and called to correct it. thought this would be a place with some people who would understand how big of a deal that can be... woo"

bipolar,depression,168,"for the first time since i was 9 i can say i am not depressed and i don‚Äôt know how to deal with it. depression has been my thing for a majority of my life, nothing ever worked until we started treating it as bp2 with lamictal. it‚Äôs been a couple of months on 200 mg ang people out of my life for years. don‚Äôt get me wrong it‚Äôs an good feeling, i actually feel like a person rather than mental illness but i honestly think it was easier to feel the apathy that came from soul sucking depression. so much to do, to catch up on and it sucks"

bipolar,ptsd,194,"social media? facebook seriously stresses me out. does anyone else struggle with social media? i have a hard time staying connected to friends and family because the things people post can be serious triggers for me. it doesn't matter if i'm upcycling or downcycling, something is bound to either agitate or depress me. sometimes i go on binges of unfollowing people. that doesn't help because then i don't have those connections and my feed fills up with promotede relationships. i have my immediate family, and a couple of close friends (that's funny. i haven't seen them in literally a year and a half) but everyone else is an acquaintance at best. i don't even talk to my mother unless i have to, and that's after we've mended our relationship (as much as possible at this point). i'm not asking for advice, i just want to know that i'm not alone in feeling like this. do others have the same experiences? can you share some?"
bipolar,anxiety,201,doing so much better the school year is finally starting! i've been going in on extra days to decorate my classroom. it's pretty much decorated and now i'm organizing my cabinets since they're a mess with random stuff shoved places. i think by the start of the year i'll have stuff totally organized. i'm so so so excited! it gives me a sense of worse. i'm sure the kids will stress me out when they come and i'll get all anxious but for now i'm having a great time.
anxiety,depression,202,"anyone else develop poor memory? hey all, i've noticed recently that i've been putting things where they don't belong, or opening cabinets to look for things that i know are in another cabinet. i'm 20. sometimes i'll be walking and i'll havip my mind constantly or i'll remember that i never went somewhere i was supposed to and then think about it and think ""wait, yes i did do that/go there."" it's really scaring the shit out of me. anyone else have these types of memory lapses?"
anxiety,depression,204,"i'm pathetic... i'm 25, no friends, living with my parents, struggling to finish school - i feel like i don't have any coping mechanisms anymore? anyone been here at my age? the older i get, the worse i seem to be at, i don't know, functioning in general. i used to be really sociable, have plenty of friends, i did well in school, had hobbies and interests - i was weird, but enough people liked me that i didn't think about it. after high school it was like the blinders were taken off and i started to see all these things about myself that i really, really hated. i started struggling a lot in social situations, i flunked out of a really good university, i couldn't hold a job, i gradually lost contact with my friends... i was a mess. don't see how to salvage any of that from what i've let myself become. i think a big part of my problems is that i'm so used to trying and failing that i'm afraid that's the only outcome if i try again. i look at myself and think ""i've given up,"" because i have. i don't want to! but i don't know how to make life work for me anymore. i don't know how to connect with people. i go out somewhere and it's impossible to think or talk clearly through the static in my head that makes me nauseous and stutter and my heart pound. what kind of a life is one where you can't even talk to someone without turning into an idiot or crying after? i can't function like this. i'll never be able to work like this. has anyone overcome a similar situation?"
ptsd,bipolar,205,"i hate everything i hate this disorder, i hate the people who did this to me, i hate the holidays, i hate knowing that no one is ever really going to actually care. when it comes down to it they just really don't. if i have to be so fucking lonely with this pain then i would rather just actually be alone then. i hate all of this."
ptsd,bipolar,207,i hate people touching me ive come to the situation where i have a brand new partner who wants to hold my hand and this is coming to a head for me again. the  moment the hand holding gets to hand rubbing i cry again and so on. im 19 what do you think i should do? understandably all of my relationships are very short
bipolar,adhd,209,"do you have garbled speech? i do at times. sometimes i will say ""the splu biders"" or ""tub bath"". reading is fine and easy, not dyslexic at all but the speech is weird. today i forget to take my meds, and found it to be worse than normal (with meds). anyone else experience this?"
adhd,bipolar,219,"strategy for beating back binge eating: dont keep bingeable foods in the house. dont buy chips, easy peel cheese wheels, crackers, ice cream, popcorn, anything you personally find bingeable. i used to be obese, never thought id get in control of my weight. long impulsive binges were my nightly vice. now, years later ive lost it all and am a normal healthy weight. turns out if i dont have quick access to convenience junk foods, i won't binge."
depression,ptsd,223,i got raped twice and get bullied about it. i started to cry myself into sleep again for a week now and i don't know what to do anymore [context in the comments] i triedly delete it if that is the case. and apologize for losing myself in writing all that down. it actually kinda helped me just to write it down and get it off my shoulders!
depression,bipolar,228,"does anyone else find it difficult to keep up with personal hygiene (brushing teeth, showering, shaving, etc) when in a depressive episode? i've been in a major depressive episode for the last two years or so and lately i find myself only brushing my teeth maybe once a day and showering only once a week. i was just wondering if anyone else struggles with this at different times during a depressive episode."
depression,bipolar,229,"dae immediately consider suicide the moment any problem arises, even if you were doing pretty ok before that? i'm on the long long road to recovery and the past few months have been comparitively really stable and happy for me. i don't c way out. my mom was just screaming at me a lot yesterday and i was so close to just ending it right there, even though i know i don't really want to, and i know i'm gonna be in a better place in just over a month (going back to college)."

ptsd,bipolar,253,"lashing out at people you love because you can't tell them what happened? is it common? too much horrible shit has happened to me in the past few weeks. one of the things i can't tell my parents. i have been going around house to house staying with other people because i want to avoid my parents. due to my other mental health issues, i still live at home at age 2my psychiatrist is being a bitch to me. didn't care that i couldn't sleep. i had to go to the e.r. (i have medicaid) to get sleeping pills that actually work because she wouldn't return my call after giving my trazedone, which doesn't even work. i'm so angry at everyone. even my therapist who i told my problem to, i don't think he takes me seriously. i'm so tired."

ptsd,bipolar,267,"i finally found some relief... i‚Äôve tried celexa, wellbutrin, and zoloft with no luck due to how hard i was hit by the side effects. i was told that since i‚Äôve had three fof 1200mg cbd juice, and- holy shit- the difference! this has changed everything in less than 24 hours and i am so humbled and grateful at the peace i‚Äôm finally getting. üôåüèº"

anxiety,depression,366,"does anyone else overanalyze what their so says and takes everything positive that they say and turn it into a negative? i just noticed this a couple of days ago when i was messaging back and forth with my boyfriend the whole day. i had just finished volunteering at a crisis hotline and we we were talking about how i needed a recommendation letter from them for my social work degree program ale of weeks and i got this thought that said ""he's going to break up with you way before that."" yesterday my boyfriend got way into this new game he got and he wasn't really paying attention to me or anyone or anything else really which just made more of those negative thoughts pop into my head like he doesn't love me. it was so bad that i couldn't sleep last night. i just need advice i guess."
anxiety,depression,367,"does anyone else talk to themselves, sometimes negatively? i consistently talk to myself. sometimes i will sit down, and have conversations with myself. it's like a back and forth q&amp;a; as my mie names too. like ""idiot"", ""stupid"", or ""loser"". in all honesty, i feel like i only call myself these names to motivate myself to do better next time. however, i'm not sure how helpful it really is."
bipolar,anxiety,376,"""1) nothing makes you happy/all you do is complain/2) everytime we talk, there's conflict, so i'm anxious whenever we speak/ 3) every time you talk, you complain."" i'm afraid of being this unhappy person who pushes people away. anyone hear else? 3 long stories; tldr at the bottom. so in the title, within quotation marks, are what i've heard from people i spent the most time with. 1) my mom, 2) a now-ex boyfriend, and 3) a former friend. 1) my mom kinda blew up in the parking lot of a hospital. the doctor said i didn't need a cough pill for my infection, and would be fine with only the prescription she gave me, and then my mom asked if she could prescribe me with a cough syrup. the doctor agreed to prescribe a strong cough syrup, and i asked if i don't need a cough pill, ""do i need cough syrup?"" the doctor said no, but said ""the medicines won't react with one another,"" and ""if you want a cough syrup, i can prescribe one."" *but i don't.* my cough won't go away (respitory infection) until the steroids kick in, but it will go away. i don't like taking meds i don't need. i'm defensive about this, because every time i have respitory issues, my mom asks the doc for a cough syrup ""for my own good"" and i feel like shit bc it's got some depressive drug in it, and i feel ultra sluggish the morning after i take it. i don't need it so i'm adverse to taking it. my mom says it's ridiculous that i have a cough and won't take a cough syrup, when no cough syrup was prescribed or suggested. the steroids will take it's course. but mothers will be mothers. i just hate taking drugs i don't actually need. (and i'm 18 so i'd think the doctor would have asked me first. guess not.) anyway she called me ungrateful and wouldn't let me speak and i dunno. it hit me. she said: ""i'm better off dead than i am alive to you, because nothing i do as your mother makes you happy."" i wanted to shoot myself in the mouth right there and then, ngl. i know that isn't the (logical) answer to this, but she isn't the only one who's said stuff like this. 2) my ldr boyfriend of two years broke up with me last night. he says he doesn't feel like he can talk to me, because he says offhanded things, and for a while, i didn't address them until months later (which is toxic). and now he feels that he'll fuck up no matter what he does, so what's the point. in the past i've addressed things as they came up and he either made fun of me, got super defensive, or asked ""so what's the problem?"". for example: he didn't speak to me for long periods of time. for like. a year. cancelled majority of skype dates at the last second. i said that i knew he has other obligations, but that still felt a bit emotionally neglected. (being left on read for days and sometimes weeks, not hearing from him for months, reading an ""i love you, too"" from him was rare. i felt like he didn't like me.) but he said that i had no reason to believe that. he had a roommate who made me cry, and he didn't defend me. even if i say that i didn't appreciate a comment, he would just join him. of course, he didn't mean to be rude, and of course he didn't mean to overlook my crying, didn't mean to misunderstand me. but he refused to buy earbuds because of his ""indispoable income"" (even if he went out to drink once a month). which gave his roommate ammo to be a bully. so i mailed my then-bf earbuds and he lost them. it felt as if he didn't put any effort into the relationship, and was justifying himself. when i asked if he wanted to break up, he sounded surprised and confused as to why. said that he loves me. i wasn't angry, just hurt and confused with all the mixed messages. but i said i believed him and ignored my gut. plus, on holidays, he drives six hundred miles in one go to visit me (and his family. so contrary to what he says, i'm not the only reason he comes to the city i live in.) but he said ""you think i wanna see my family? barely anyone there wants to see me. i'md avoiding me, too. avoiding everyone. got in a real bad funk. said uncalled for comments to me and to other people. i understand how depression can be; but that doesn't excuse her from being mean. from playing rough and with scissors (as a seventeen year old). from going out of her way to patronize people. but she put on her snapchat story her suicidal thoughts, talking about how everyone she knows is against her. so i swiped up, let her know that i apologize if i wronged her, and that i want her to be okay. that i don't think anyone is against her. that i am here if she needs to talk. she said that i can't make her pity me, and i was baffled. that she doesn't have the energy for my bullshit. (yikes.) that i shouldn't play nice if i don't feel nicely about a person. (still don't know what's she was talking about but it was childish. but still yikes.) and then she said all i do is complain about my family problems and boyfriend and do nothing to fix it. (that was when i said ""good to know,"" and blocked her. hehe.) it's so funny that she *asked me* what's wrong, didn't accept ""nothing"" for an answer, and then secretly hated when i was open and honest. i thought she was my friend. but i guess only therapists are meant to hear your problems. anyway. i digress. days after i blocked her, she came around me in person. went out of her way to sit next to me. acted fearful, as if i would reject her. took every single chance she got to be overly nice. for example: i was presenting and the class (of 13 people) was talking over me. she stood up, cupped both hands over her mouth, and projected: ""everyone! chris is talking! it is important to hear what they say, so that they can finish their presentation!"" sat down, then grinned at me. the class had the same weirded-out expression as i did. like. ugh. that was so artificial that it hurt me. i have a floridan friend who i tell some of these situations with, and he says it sounds like the other person has some unsolved problems of their own. my therapist said the same thing about all three scenarios. that nothing i complain about is like. ""i'm so sad my dad got me a blue car. i wanted a red one."" y'know? like the problems that bother me are literally ""so i'm homeless and don't know where i'm sleeping tonight "" or ""i got 27 spider bites in my sleep"" or ""my mom is threatening to kick me out and i'm an unemployed student"" or something that can't be given advice, because it's totally out of anyone's control. like when my car got totalled and i kept having flashbacks about the crash throughout the day. i couldn't sleep at night. for weeks. or when three of my classmates died. or when i was in a sexually abusive relationship for six months, got assaulted everyday on school grounds, and didn't tell anyone for eight months. i have flashbacks and awful dreams about *that* one to this day. but i don't say anything until someone asks me what's wrong. and even if they do, i'm reluctant to say so. bc none of this can be hugged better. it's heavy. it's uncomfortable and nobody wants to hear it. those are the only things that get to me. those are the things i go to therapy for. but my therapist doesn't believe in dwelling on (talking about) past traumas and griefs. i don't know what anyone wants me to do anymore. do i just let go of *everything*? i do not exagerrate; these things happened in the same twelve months. i'm not trying to excuse my complaints, but, yikes. i don't know what to make of any of this. anyway. tldr: nobody i open up to stick around. are all of these situations like. situations where both parties have made acceptable mistakes in handling their situation? or am i this unhappy person who makes people miserable because i complain so much? am i ungrateful? am i being crazy for saying the things i do? does anyone else hear statements like these from people who see you the most? it's times like these that makes self destructive behavior so easy."
depression,bipolar,380,"if you feel shitty, help someone else not feel shitty. kinda shitty advice. but i'll start with some backstory. i'm on mobile so forgive me. (this will be kinda rambly) i was diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety disorder after i checked into a psychiatric hospital a few years back, but i always felt as i grew up that something was wrong. when i went to go meet my biological mother (who is very bipolar) when i was 18 things started to click with me that i needed to figure out a way to find meaning. it didn't help that my step-mom was an abusive cunt. so overall i kinda suck at being a person.(still do) anyways, i've struggled with constantly feeling down, and also feeling a whole lotta shit i didn't really understand. because of this i turned to weed and alcohol when i was 15. went through a few phases of drinking hard, but really weed was my poison of choice(still dont think it's bad but that's for another sub). again anyways because of the plant i kinda regained a sense of what it meant to be a healthy funcnt know how we'll pay the rent, things get complicated with family, with work, with life. and all of it together makes me wanna opt out. but then i think of leaving him by himself to deal with it himself and what a living hell that would be. even if i cant do much, ill do what i can till i can't. because if i dont that would make me sadder than anything i can ever encounter in my life. my point is that out there there are strong, amazing, incredibly intelligent and driven people, who do this shit alone. while feeling everything. and its heart breaking. my dad spent his life trying to make me feel welcome when every fiber of my being says i don't belong on this earth. the least i can do is gtfo bed and try to do something. even if my battle that day is just to brush my teeth. so that he can see a good looking smile that he made. to make him feel just a little better. that's my part, my mission. thats what gets me up. there are people that can use your help, and you owe it to them. but that s just my opinion."

bipolar,adhd,395,"forgetting how to speak correctly, or at all. i'm just curious to see if this happens to anyone else; the title is pretty self explanatory. (tl;dr at bottom) i don't mean like i'm ""out of it"" or even just fatigued for the day and my brain loses its train of thought one too many times. i feel like that happens to everyone at least once in a while (including myself). i mean like it takes an insane amount of mental energy for me to say a sentence from start to finish correctly, usually takes me a few tries to do so. so to say to speak, or how to speak in general. anyone else have similar experiences? tl;dr: does anyone sometimes find their speech to be very impaired, like you feel as if you forgot how to speak at all? maybe due to an episode, personal issues, both, etc? edit: thank you so much everyone who replied to this post, sharing your experiences and such. one of my biggest insecurities is my speech (due to the issue mentioned in this post) and it's so comforting to have so much nice, supportive feedback and to know i'm not alone on this :)"

anxiety,depression,1312,"recently i've been diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses that have led to me being fired from my job. my doctor and counselor have me listed as extreme anxiety and depression, early childhood ptsd, bi polar, borderline personality disorder. it's a relief to have an answer to what my problems are. this has been an on going problem my whole adult life. my first job, i had reasons for being depressed. i dropped out of school, parents were divorcing and i didn't have a stable housing situation, i was falling behind and depressed, full of anger and anxiety. i didn't want to call myself weak though and admit i had a problem, so i attempted to self medicate by escaping reality. i skateboarded, played video games, drank, smoked weed, partied, did everything i could to feel numb. 5 years later, because i didn't seek help or medicationn test, then i can finish my sdi application. my point to all this is i would be homeless and probably dead without her. she has saved my ass countless times over the years,having a mental illness makes holding a job so fucking difficult, i've lost at least 6 jobs since being with her. i have nothing but respect and love for her to be putting up with all this, while we are both still fairly young (i'm 24, she's 21 later this year) i wish her parents understood mental illness, but it's kind of a taboo in her family so we keep things as vague as possible. i just hope that i get through to disability services and can make an income that way, to relieve some stress from her life. she put off school for me from the very beginning, the least i can do is help her get through school. sorry about the rant. i hope everyone has a great day."

adhd,bipolar,1319,"after over a month unemployed, i finally have a really promising interview this morning. so my last job was kind of a shit-show. i was having real issues with focus and staying interested at my last-last job (this was before i was diagnosed) and going through a lot of personal stuff in my life (divorce) i wanted to make more money, and get a change, and prove to my ex that i was capable. i let pride blind me, and i applied for a job as an embedded engineer with a local company. well... due to moving needs in the company, they decided they didn't really need an embedded guy at the time, and brought me on as a c# software developer to try me out. i volunteered on a large scale embedded projec wasn't a need anywhere for my talents at day's end. i'm honestly pretty sure he was surprised as i was that i was let go, but the decision was made way above his head. i was pretty fuckin' bummed for the last month. anyway. just got a call yesterday from a small company looking to bring on a senior fpga engineer to lead their satellite technology development, and i believe i'm perfect for the role. i've always wanted to put stuff in to space, so i'm very stoked right now. i'm hoping the interview goes well, and that i manage to impress them. i could really use the win right now. also, now that i've got the meds, and i've got the right therapy, i really think this will be my chance to shine."
