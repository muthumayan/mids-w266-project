anxiety,depression,8,"i was sitting at the doctors waiting for my husband to finish when the 700 club came on the tv talking about how jesus healed mental and physical disabilities. i thought about just going to the cnews. so i changed it to local news. so now listening to a million commercials, but none of them claiming i can be cured by allowing jesus into my heart. but i did it!! i'm really proud of myself."
bipolar,adhd,14,"someone reminded me the other day that there’s no cure for this disorder. as someone with a family history of it and someone who has been struggling with it most of my life, i objectively knew that, but i realized that this whole time i’ve been trying to change my medicine for almost a year, my mind has been hopeful for a cure. i have been wanting to cure it, not treat it, but actually be rid of it forever. wow. remembering that there’s no cure really hurts a lot and makes me kinda hopeless."
bipolar,depression,17,"i live with my family. we have different schedules so we don't see each other a lot. when we do, we get along okay, but they just don't understand me. it sounds super cliche but... we don't have a lot of the same things in common. they don't want to talk about the stuff i like to talk about, and on the off chance i do end up having a conversation about said things, i'm left feeling... ashamed? that's not the right word. kind of stupid, i gd the things i go through. and it's hard to find those kinds of people. i feel like the people around me are not on the same intellectual level as i am. not to say that they're stupid, because they're not, but our interests are just not the same. i need mental stimulation. i need adult conversation. i'm just here to vent, but is there anyone here who understands what i'm trying to say? i'm in my mid 20's, but i feel like an angsty teenager."
depression,bipolar,22,"sorry if this has been asked before, but i was wondering if anyone knows or has experienced their intelligence deteriorating because of depression (or maybe meds)? er every year, i can't tell if it's because of my illness (i have chronic depression so i'll be taking meds my whole life) or what. any insight would be appreciated."
adhd,anxiety,23,"i just came to complain honestly. i’ve been trying to fall asleep for hours and i have to be up early and the fact that i have to wake up tomorrow morning stresses me out and then it makes it harder for me to sleep. i get so frustrated that people can just “go to sleep.” every time i put my phone away and close my eyes my mind just races with thoughts. sometimes anxious thoguhts, hypothetical scenarios, replaying conversations,  not even think it’s a panic attack, i can really only just describe it as just “one of those nights” and it’s torture. not to mention i’ve had like 2 different songs mentally playing while i’ve tried to write this and lost track of myself while writing this post about three times. anyways thanks for reading if u made it to the end. it’s just comforting knowing that i’m not the only one bc it genuinely feels like i’m going crazy."
ptsd,depression,26,"i hate this disorder, i hate the people who did this to me, i hate the holidays, i hate knowing that no one is ever really going to actually care. when it comes down to it they just really don't. if i have to be so fucking lonely with this pain then i would rather just actually be alone then. i hate all of this."
ptsd,bipolar,32,"not all that unusual where i work actually. the supervisor i broke down in front of had his own breakdown about 8 years ago. its an engineering company that specializes in large, high risk sort of projects. so lots of crazy hours and stress. without realizing it, i went something like a week without sleep. i was supposeannot be on most meds), and various other things. nope....i get a couple of emails detailing the online videos i have to watch. ""sexual harassment: always a bad touch"", ""work place violence: serpentine to success"", ""msds and you"", along with ""export proprietary controls for intellectual property"" our hr department sucks."
adhd,depression,60,"i like getting to scurry around the house. i like making things look nice. rubbing off grime gives them a new life. i can daydream while i clean. i pump up plishment every few minutes or so. clutter stresses me out. clean, smooth surfaces feel good to touch (sensory) its the best form of procrastination. ha. ;)"
bipolar,ptsd,65,"third week of school. one class has an attendance policy of forfeiting all attendance points if you miss more than two classes. i mean, attendance is 40/420 pts so it could be worse. i guess. just gotta blow them away with my assignments... i’ll start by drinking this bottle of vodka. fall 2019 is not going as planned."
depression,anxiety,69,i make a lot of mistakes and am very awkward so i end up thinking the words “kill yourself” dozens of times a day. it’s like a reflex at this point. i’m not actually going to kill myself but it’s like some subconscious desire bubbling up from deep down. i’m afraid i’ll start saying it out loud or something
anxiety,adhd,82,"i am just posting this to ease the minds of people who have gad who sometimes wonder whether it is ""real"" as a disability or not or whether we are making it up, its in our heads, etc.. i came across the stat as i was writing a formal letter requesting an extension on a deadline for my section 8 voucher because of my gad. i was googling whether it was considered a disability or not (i already knew it was...), and i came across that stat which exemplifies how disabling it can be."
ptsd,anxiety,83,my new therapist has been really great. today in our third session she asked if i would be more comfortable talking if she wasn't looking at me. i'm never comfortabl made such a huge difference for me and i feel a lot better about our sessions in general. i feel kind of stupid but holy shit! a small thing makes a huge difference!
depression,anxiety,84,"i didn't wake up yesterday until 6pm. i laid in bed until 9, woke up and bought a case of beer and 2 packs of cigarettes and started binge drinking. i took a shower for the first time in days. i wanted to be clean and drunk for what i planned to do. today is my 25th birthday. i didn't want to live this day. i planned to cut my arms up and bleed to death in the shower, but i wanted to play a few last rounds of rocket league to calm my nerves. then i got a message from a random player i was in a few matches with: ""wanna play in a party? playing with randoms is getting onmy spirits throughout the day today. i've told my family everything and will be seeking help in the form of therapy and a possible medication adjustment, if necessary. if you're out there reading this and you can't see the way back up, cling to me and we'll climb up together. again, thank you all so much for taking the time out of your day to wish me well and feel free to pm me anytime or to add me on psn: coonroast55 (it has to do with my last name and the fact that me and my friends used to put -roast on the end of everyone's last name for no reason whatsoever). &lt;3"
ptsd,bipolar,88,"at 7:23pm my dad passed away five years ago today. i have been on edge all day. sneaking off to the walking fridge to cry when i don’t have too many tickets in the window. sunday’s are always hard because of brunch. staff and gu the blood/brain barrier. but his lab forced him to retire early and he took it personally. he made the test for aids/hiv, hepatitis a,b, and c, west nile, and chagas’ disease. i just want to tell him i love him one last time..."
bipolar,anxiety,93,i've been struggling to rationalize myself right now. i have thoughts to hurt or kill myself. or walk for hundreds of miles. that my family and friends hate me that to fail.fail.fail.fail.fail. i don't know how to control this my speech is being affected by this either too fast or slow and slurred. this anxiety has to stop now.
ptsd,bipolar,95,"i typed out a whole long vent post but then realized i really just wanted to know if anyone else had the same problem. my ex is the first out of many different guys who respected my boundaries and always made sure that our sex was fully consensual. we dated for a year, broke uherapy and that i will eventually find a man i can trust, although i am worried that i'll run into the wrong men before i find him. i'm just curious - how many of you have gotten too attached to people who treated you well after your diagnosis (or after you developed symptoms)?"
anxiety,depression,97,"tomorrow i bury my best friend who tragically passed away at the age of 25. i'm heartbroken and i will be speaking at his funeral. i am happy with the speech but i am nervous, petrified to mess up. he was an incredible guy and i want to send him off well, justify what he meant to me. my ex who broke up with me 2 months ago has kept contact to ask how i have been doing and if i ever needed anything go to her. i went to the gym yesterday evening just to pass the time and maybe work off a small hangover i was nursing from the night before. i felt okay but by the end of my session i was very tired. as i was walking back towards my flat i spot my ex with a guy next to her sitting down. i could have turned around but i didn't. i go up to her and say hi, she seems shocked to see me and asks if i'm doing okay. i say no, not really and say i'll leave them to it and say goodbye. as i walk down the road my ex has caught up with me after she runs to catch up with me. she says she has done this to tell me thatuy who has a family that makes her laugh, feel alive. this guy has a child. i recognise him from her xmas party. i'm really confused about why she chased after me. it's obvious she cares but is she feeling guilty, trying to spare my feelings in the hardest time of my life. i do want her back in my life but seeing her with another guy hurt big time. seeing them close to each other eating ice cream. she works with him, did she like him when we were dating. i also hate the idea of her sharing her sympathy and support with other people, especially a guy like that. and it hurts to hear her say to me he's going through a hard time. i'm going through the hardest time of my life. i feel like i can't use her as a crutch. i'm so confused, hurt, a mess. i bury my best friend tomorrow . i am absolutely terrified. i feel sick, like i'm going to mess up and ruin everything. the last 2 months has been the worst of my life, it just has. i want things to be better. i want him back. i want her back. i feel terrible."
anxiety,adhd,99,"i mean, it’s pretty catch-all, hitting every note from personal catastrophic failure to an impending apocalypse. “well, it’d suck real bad if [blank] happened, but there’s always a rock to smash your own head in with!”"
none,anxiety,100,"yesterday, after finishing my office work i left for home in my car. on the way i saw my neighbour walking on the footpath. i offered him a lift. he politely refused saying he is in a hurry."
bipolar,anxiety,104,"well lady... i run off to different countries, i steal cars, i get drunk, i take drugs, i have sex with strangers, i cut myself, i punch myself in the face, i try to kill myself, i have major anxiety and i’m baseline depressed 3 times a year. does that answer your question?"
anxiety,ptsd,105,"seriously. a minute ago, i was shoveling food into my mouth. i felt like i had a billion things to do at the moment, even though in reality i had a lot of time to do those things. i felt light headed and my heart was rac change things up. (forgive me if this is an obvious lpt. it's certainly not new because i've been told it countless times, but i've often overlooked it. hopefully this will help those of you who overlooked it as i have.)"
adhd,anxiety,109,"every time i get into an argument/ debate i’m either a second away from crying or a second away from an angry outburst. it’s so hard to keep my cool and as a result... i learned to stop talking/ people please/ avoid the topic whenever thin the rest of the day because i feel like i’ve been rejected. everytime i feel rejected i suddenly think everyone is going to abandon me, and i get stuck in that feeling. i’m learning slowly and taking my time... but god does this shit suck!"
ptsd,anxiety,115,"i know it's only september but i'm already feeling it, especially with halloween advertising everywhere already. usually go see in-laws but don't know if i can handle that at all this year...."
bipolar,depression,125,"i was recently pming with someone about relationships, heartbreak, and feeling broken and picked up on a shared sentiment. that our mental illnesses made us less deserving of love from healthy people. which my rational mind tells me is total bullshit, but it's still a sentiment i have to put effort into rejecting. it's no secret i've been investing serious time into online dating, but i think it's progress on my part that most of the time i don't feel like my mental illness disqualifies me from relationships with healthy people. i still feel like i'll be better understood by people who experience depression and whatnot and like my issues will be less of a burden to someone with their own struggles for me to give back to, but as i was thinking abouto more broken than any ""normie."" *how many of you have struggled to feel like it's okay to have relationships with healthy people, and of those of you who have, what if anything has helped you chip away at that feeling?* as broken as i've felt and as flawed as i've been, i've never been broken and i've never stopped being worth loving. there have been things about me that have made it harder to love me, like my former bmi of nearly 40 as a barrier to that kind of attracted attention, but even then i was sometimes shown that kind of love. **however broken you may feel and however unlovable you may feel, you are most certainly mistaken. you are complete and just as flawed as everyone else and worthy of love, however hard it may be to find that love.**"
bipolar,ptsd,128,"facebook seriously stresses me out. does anyone else struggle with social media? i have a hard time staying connected to friends and family because the things people post can be serious triggers for me. it doesn't matter if i'm upcycling or downcycling, something is bound to either agitate or depress me. sometimes i go on binges of unfollowing people. that doesn't help because then i don't have those connections and my feed fills up with promoted crap thaationships. i have my immediate family, and a couple of close friends (that's funny. i haven't seen them in literally a year and a half) but everyone else is an acquaintance at best. i don't even talk to my mother unless i have to, and that's after we've mended our relationship (as much as possible at this point). i'm not asking for advice, i just want to know that i'm not alone in feeling like this. do others have the same experiences? can you share some?"
adhd,bipolar,130,today i almost feel like... manic? i don't want to minimize what it's like to have an actual manic episode but goodness gracious my mind is racing. and i cannot focus on anything and feel like need to do something crazy. (more than i usually do hahaha)
ptsd,depression,138,"i know that's a very ""wtf"" topic title, but weird times call for weird celebrations. just googled him for the first time in eons and found new news articles. now i'm just sitting here laughing at how thoroughly he's fucked up his life. probation violation :) actually, twelve of em, but who's counting? **he has** ***nothing*** **left**. he has forfeited a high-paying licensed career, almost a decade of life outside prison now, his well-kozen lives is probably never going to be happy again. :) *was it worth it, my good bitch? would you make the same life choices and still be a degenerate piece of shit...or do you regret it a lil by this point?* i'm just so fucking jazzed at this news. that violent waste of oxygen can eat shit and taste his own karma. **may all the terrible people in your life end up ruining their own lives with their gratuitously awful decisions too :)**"
adhd,depression,144,"apologies for the use of that word in this post, for those who might be sensitive to it. *edit again* copy/pasting a comment to another user: where i'm from people use it as a slur toward the autism community. i'm actually not even sure it's just where i'm from - i see it all over the internet too. i don't personally think they're synonymous but since i witness ""autistic"" and ""retarded"" being used in the same sentence by shitty people all the time, i only wanted to be clear that i don't feel the same way and that i don't want to hurt anyone with my post :( that's why i had previously written that i don't use that word, nor would i ever call someone that anywt. but when i argue with my boyfriend i can barely remember what i've just said...i can't always remember how the argument even started. i get really flustered and then that gets worse. all i seem to hear is ""you're wrong."" i'm not always good at getting across what i mean the first time, either. so in frustration last night, my boyfriend asked me ""are you retarded?"" and it honestly hurt me a bit. i know some of you have had people ask you that. you start giving the question some thought because you feel you can't do anything right, ever. i'm not sure why i'm making this post...just feeling down in general. fucks with me every time, when someone asks me that."
adhd,none,145,"i picked up this new book called the subtle art of not giving a f*** from one of my favorite writers, mark manson and i've found it incredibly useful for dealing with both my day to day and future goals. one of my favorite quotes from the book is this: *“the desire forsing your fucks on that. anyway, if the above quotes sparked your interest i highly recommend purchasing the book. there are many fantastic subtleties to the topic that i couldn't possibly put down into a short post and mark manson is a great. peace and have a good day."
anxiety,bipolar,148,"so i am starting to venture out of the house after having a very hard time leaving my 2 floor walkup apartment for almost a year now. tonight i accomplished getting to my favorite bookstore which is just around the corner for the first time since last spring! and guess what? here's what happened: i didn't faint. i didn't die. i didn't let lightheadedness/dizziness/for my husband who is my soul mate and best friend! (couldn't have done it without him!) recently, i started pushing myself to get outside more and more every day. today was a major milestone! spoke to people on the street. got myself some gifts. felt like my ""old self"". super freaking refreshing. just wanted to share w y'all that there is hope for us and the world!"
anxiety,adhd,152,"i ordered a pizza online but after i submitted it i realized i put the wrong toppings. normally i'd just accept my fate and pick off the mushrooms i accidentally ordered, but this time i picked up the phone right away and called to correct it. thought this would be a place with some people who would understand how big of a deal that can be... woo"
adhd,depression,154,"volunteer at a nature park. i did that once for school before depression made it hard to go to school. it was great, made me feel productive, helped me socialize, and made me happy. it is something i can do, believe in, and will be make me happy. :)"
anxiety,depression,155,"i feel like i've cried a dozen times since hearing about it, watching parents speak on the news and reading tweets from the kids who went to school there (including some who were horribly killed). for some reasoke everyone else i strongly believe children should be protected and put first no matter what so things like this are just... so unspeakable. i hope the gun laws in america change for the sake of school children."
anxiety,depression,163,backlash or not keep those comments to yourself. unless you want to keep your account keep those fucking thoughts to yourself. had enough of seeing that shit today. it’s disgusting.
adhd,bipolar,166,"you know how sometimes you'll just remember something in the past you did and cringe at yourself and its like, kinda physically painful? that's the feeling i'm talking about. for most people it just kinda comes and goes and they are fine bearing it for a moment, however i seem to either be hypersensitive to the feeling or just really bad at regulating it (probably a bit of both tbh), as half the time ""i wanna punch myself"" doesn't stop at just being a descriptor of how and feel and ends up being a bit of how i cope with it til it passes :/ i'll end up hitting myself on my leg or arm or something or punching a nearby wall as a way to relieve the tension, never hard enough to leave a lasting mark but often enough to be worrisome. i know it's not healthy but i don't know what else to do cuz the feeling is otherwise ui'll end up having a panic attack, yet i pretty much never actively avoid possible triggers and even signed up for my school's improv and dance clubs completely out of my own freewill (actually participating, however, is a different matter). basically, never happens to me lol. does anyone have any advice on better ways to cope with the cringe feelings, or with just emotional regulation in general? i'm on ritalin ir rn and while it does seem to help a bit, the problem is still very present, especially later in the evening or at night where i'm more tired and the meds have worn off. **tl;dr i have general emotional regulation problems and specifically always end up coping with ""cringe"" feelings with self harm. does anyone have advice on healthier ways to cope or other general help with emotional regulation?** thanks!"
adhd,anxiety,168,"just a friendly reminder to unclench your jaw, and remember it’s one day at a time. you’re doing great, and even if you’re not it’s okay. you are worthy, you are loved, and if today isn’t your day; i speak peace and warmth for your tomorrow. ❤️"
bipolar,anxiety,172,she's still an infant and i'm already worried that she knows that mommy is going through the motions some days. i try to keep doing our regular activities but it is so hard to smile and look and act enthusiastic. i'm just so tired and sad and i'm not sure i'm giving her what she needs. i'd love to hear your advice and experiences.
anxiety,bipolar,177,"i just noticed this a couple of days ago when i was messaging back and forth with my boyfriend the whole day. i had just finished volunteering at a crisis hotline and we we were talking about how i needed a recommendation letter from them for my social work degree program and he was saying ""it sounds like an intense program, but if anyone can do it it's my hat said ""he's going to break up with you way before that."" yesterday my boyfriend got way into this new game he got and he wasn't really paying attention to me or anyone or anything else really which just made more of those negative thoughts pop into my head like he doesn't love me. it was so bad that i couldn't sleep last night. i just need advice i guess."
ptsd,anxiety,178,ive come to the situation where i have a brand new partner who wants to hold my hand and this is coming to a head for me again. the second this happens i start to cry and they get put off. they ask if im uncomfortable literally every time no matter the person and i have to say no because its not normal. ive tried to muscle through it but the moment the hand holding gets to hand rubbing i cry again and so on. im 19 what do you think i should do? understandably all of my relationships are very short
adhd,none,184,"from an article i just read: &amp;#x200b; *the chaotic, ephemeral eddies under his grandfather's rowboat are a perfect image of nelson's style of thought. i was already taping our conversation, but nelson clearly wanted his own record. not because he was concerned about being quoted correctly, but because his tape recorder and video camera are weapons in an unending battle against amnesia. the inventor suffers from an extreme case of attention deficit disorder, a recently named psychological syndrome whose symptoms include unusual sensitivity to interruption.* *if he is stopped in the middle of anything, he forgets it instantly. only by running his own tape recorder could nelson be confident that his words would not float off, irrecoverably, into the atmosphere.* *nand a filmmaker, but he needed a way to avoid getting lost in the frantic multiplication of associations his brain produced. his great inspiration was to imagine a computer program that could keep track of all the divergent paths of his thinking and writing. to this concept of branching, nonlinear writing, nelson gave the name* *although the concept of hypertext made nelson legendary in programming circles, he is not a programmer. ""i have a terrific math problem,"" nelson said. ""i still can't add up a checkbook: i can add a column of figures five times, get four different answers, and none of them will be right. i'm very accident-prone and extremely impatient. i can't work my macintosh - i have three that are completely unfunctional and one is marginally functional.""*"
adhd,bipolar,186,"some days, i get a lot of stuff done. if i’m on a roll. there are also areas like some school subjects i do well in. those days/specific areas are somehow the mos the chores my partner asked me to, leaves a mess, lies down catatonic on the couch for hours, snaps at criticism and bursts into tears of frustration - oh, right."
anxiety,depression,189,"i think about death all the time. everything i do at this point i ask myself why? it won't matter when i'm dead. i keep thinking how i could die tonight, to tomorrow or in my 20's or in my 40's or just go into cardiac arrest before i finish posting this. what if i'm dead before this year ends? what if i'm dead before i meet a girl, or have kids, or hell what if i die before the next time i get to eat a steak or smoke a cigar. does anyone else have this? if so how do you cope? thanks. and sorry if i rambled."
depression,anxiety,198,"i usually dont wash or fold unless i absolutely have to, so i typically look like a mess. having folded clothes made me a little more confident when i got dressed that i could make it through today."
ptsd,depression,204,"i believe we are stronger than the demons we face. i know it’s hard and sometimes it seems impossible. but we all can do it. just keep fighting and keep your heads up. love you guys. stay strong, stay sane, stay alive!"
adhd,depression,208,"nobody else in my life would understand this but i know you guys would. all my life i have been shit at school and academic learning. i've been medicated for almost two years now. i heard today that my assignment for a professional qualification scored 80%, one of the highest marks given. i could never have done that prior to treatment. i am so god damn proud of myself."
anxiety,depression,210,it doesn't seem to matter how good of a day i had the day before or what happened it seems i always wake up with lots of depression and anxiety that doesn't fade away until two or 3pm.ly back to the same old feeling in the morning that take all day to overcome. i feel like if i could replicate the few days i don't wake up with anxiety that my situation would improve.
bipolar,adhd,213,i promised a friend i'd make a poster and a pin the tail on the donkey game for his kid's birthday. then i forgot - because my own kid had a school project that i threw all my free time this week into. i remembered thursday at work abofeel stupid for this. i also had a twelve hour work day yesterday and it's a job that requires tons of running. i hope they're happy with it all. if they're not... i guess i'll just have to accept that and know that i gave it my best!!!
bipolar,depression,216,"i was just thinking today as i work on a painting and deal with soul sucking depression that i am extremely talented. i’ve gotten full ride scholarships for art school, i have won state awards, i don’t think i’ve ever not gotten into a juried show, i rule. i know how easy it is to get caught up in your negative qualities (especially with mental illness) but what are your strengths?"
adhd,depression,218,"yeah, i’ll try harder. and i’ll also try extra hard to leave on time today instead of sticking around past the point where they’re actually paying me to be here."
anxiety,depression,219,"i constantly feel like i’m being lied to. i overanalyze things, my brain always finds a way to twisted things people say so it seems like a lie. my head hurts and i often cry. things started to feel like this since i was being cheated on 6 years ago."

depression,adhd,229,"does anyone else ever feel like... they aren’t doing things for enjoyment but they’re just doing manual controls of themselves bc they have to? “ okay now it’s time to eat. okay that’s done, now it’s time to lay down. okay that’s done, now it’s time to see your friends” but everything really just feels like you’re going through the motions without any real enjoyment?"
anxiety,depression,231,"i love to grow flowers, it's pretty much my only hobby and the main way that i de-stress. i have flower beds all around my house and i view my plants as my ""babies."" but last year my emotional support cat passed away at 12 years old and i feel like my soul went with him, it was thet getting nervous and going back inside. now my beloved garden has its life back, and i feel a little bit better. now that i have new things popping up from the ground i have no excuse to ignore them. i hope i can muster up the strength to keep going. for today, i'm proud of myself."
bipolar,adhd,235,"i gotta vent. dad, you've been giving mixed compliments for the past week. backhanded praise and shit. ""i don't care if you fail, i care if you try."" too fucking bad dad, i care more if i fail than if i try, and i get that that doesn't get me anywhere; it feels pretty shitty to be reminded my ridiculous rejection sensitivity makes me a terrible person. fine, impedes my success. you didn't call me a terrible person. but that's what i'm getting at. the rejection sensitivity. what amounted to ""your not trying for the sake of avoiding getting hurt disappoints and irritates me"" turned into ""you're a terrible person."" or maybe i took it to mean ""you're broken."" i often think i am. how do you think it feels when i submit 10 job applications and my brain does the same thing about not hearing back? how do you think it feels to be constantly looking at jobs trying to balance what i'm qualified for, what won't be soul-crushingly mind-numbing, and what will actually move me forward in life? and then after beating myself up to get myself to start and continue that process, getting discouraged either not hearing back or hearing i didn't get the job. and then there's: what if i actually here back? interviews are std am now telling myself ""you're gonna be the lazy drug using social security beneficiary nobody wants to get their money"" while i tell myself i don't deserve it because i feel like a liar. but you know what? it may hurt, **but i take it on for you**. because i acknowledge my debilitating fear of trying on the job front and would rather take on shame than let my failure to launch weigh you down. when i was growing up, i used to tell myself ""no one can hurt you more than your own family."" i think that's still true for me today. thanks dad. *do you know why i changed therapists after you got your cancer diagnosis?* **i wanted to make sure you'd be proud of me before you died.** i sure as hell don't feel like you are right now. tl;dr: my dad hurt me and pissed me off by telling me he doesn't feel like i try and expressing frustration at how much time i put into videogames (where i can at least feel successful at **something**) when i spent less time on videogames today than half of what i spend most days in general. seriously, videogaming and weight loss are the only two things i've succeeded at since graduation. maybe not dying, too, but i don't think that should count. good to know i'm a disappointment."
anxiety,depression,239,feel free to message me anytime. i may not always be able to reapond right away but i always respond eventually and i never ghost away. i try my best to hold conversation woth anyone. i love you all.
bipolar,adhd,242,"i'm just curious to see if this happens to anyone else; the title is pretty self explanatory. (tl;dr at bottom) i don't mean like i'm ""out of it"" or even just fatigued for the day and my brain loses its train of thought one too many times. i feel like that happens to everyone at least once in a while (including myself). i mean like it takes an insane amount of mental energy for me to say a sentence from start to finish correctly, usually takes me a few tries to do so. so to say a 3 sentence response to somethiow to speak in general. anyone else have similar experiences? tl;dr: does anyone sometimes find their speech to be very impaired, like you feel as if you forgot how to speak at all? maybe due to an episode, personal issues, both, etc? edit: thank you so much everyone who replied to this post, sharing your experiences and such. one of my biggest insecurities is my speech (due to the issue mentioned in this post) and it's so comforting to have so much nice, supportive feedback and to know i'm not alone on this :)"
none,ptsd,246,"i was recording the police while they were using same mouthpiece to check for *drinking under influence* during march. i felt that this is wrong to do while there is a contagious virus out there, you fucking don't know who's got it. one traffic cop sneaked up to me and held me while he called all his colleagues, 7-8 guys surrounding me. their leader screamed and yelled at much law exists and people know about it, it will make a significant difference because the police will have a sense of ""someone's watching me"" and could bring down police brutality. edit: deleted the video, it made me feel uncomfortable having it in my gallery. i had nightmares about how it could have gone more wrong, for a week. you know it's bad when police gives you ptsd."

anxiety,adhd,252,"while the titles is pretty self explanatory, i’ll elaborate a little bit. my anxiety has gotten so bad that any time i go to add something to a conversation (whether irl or online) my brain just immediately starts telling me that what i have to say doesn’t matter. it could literally be me commentin my brain that there are people who do value my opinions and what i have to add to the conversation. but it’s at the point that it’s starting to effect my personal and professional development in life and it’s just this massive hurdle that i can’t seem to get over. has anybody else experienced this?"
anxiety,adhd,269,"you are not the boss of me. had i written this two days ago i would have said, ""you win; i surrender."" you took my thoughts and turned them against me. forcing me to question my actions and my trajectory. making me look negatively at everything thatch time i forget about everything and you come to the forefront. you are so clever but your days are numbered. just remember that i am doing the work. you are here because i am here and i will continue to be here. so buckle up and take all the seats!"
adhd,anxiety,273,"he observed that i’m always on my phone or reading or listening to music or watching television or working on something or (more often than not) some combination thereof. he’s never seen me sit and do nothing but think. my dude, my guy, i’m never not thinking. i wish my brain would just shut up every now and then. i’m always doing something because if i don’t direct that mental energy somehow, it turns into intrusive thoughts, anxiety, or self-destructive tendencies. stimulation is required."
ptsd,anxiety,277,i've started to use cbd oil to manage my anxiety and i feel like a person again. i have energy to both accept any negative feelings i have and still put out a positivity to other people. which is something i strugglebetter in public in general. i can focus when i read and not forget things because i don't have my brain going a mile a minute. this stuff makes me feel like my life has changed drastically. i'm so grateful it exists.
depression,adhd,283,"did my title catch your attention enough? good. because i have no idea what to write here. only time i need to use a subreddit like this is when i'm really freaked out, and when i'm upset like this i can't ll the responses. i'm going to be writing an update post which will be titled something along the lines of [""my fate rests in this title: creative.. i know.. thank you and have a good day! edit 2: added link"
bipolar,ptsd,291,i had the worst one of my life tonight. i was psychotic and had a flashback to my attempt. multiple times. my hand was talking to me and telling me bad things. i have 3-4 nightmares a week and they aren't getting better. i don't know why this is happening.
adhd,bipolar,294,i am line cook at a grill&amp;bar restaurant making minimum wage &lt;-- which sucks ass. i am tired of working in the restaurant industry after long hours and shitty pays. time for me to book an appointment with my psychologist (i haven't seen my psychologist since last year) and go to college for a better life.
depression,bipolar,295,i've been in a major depressive episode for the last two years or so and lately i find myself only brushing my teeth maybe once a day and showering only once a week. i was just wondering if anyone else struggles with this at different times during a depressive episode.
anxiety,depression,307,like i hate it for two reasons because first of all it either emasculating or infantilising. and second it implies that im not doing my best or at the least not trying or sometimes it comes off as someone making light of my feelings.
anxiety,depression,315,"hello, i'm about to ask my crush out in a few minutes via text message (lame, i know, but i can't find the right words in person and i don't want her to feel uncomfortablee i will probably regret it in a few years otherwise. wish me luck edit: just sent the message edit 2: she dumped me, great and friendly sub though thank you all very much."
bipolar,anxiety,318,"sorry for the rambling post. i just need a safe place to vent. i'm pretty much losing it. i haven't been to work all week because i'm crippled with anxiety and i've been super irritable, lashing out,t know if it will do much good as i know that when i get out i won't be able to afford the medication they'll put me on and i'll be back to square one. i'm sorry. i just feel so overwhelmed right now."
adhd,depression,333,"fairly new to this subreddit (been browsing it for about a week) and i'd just like to say that i absolutely love the energy on this sub. from your posts i've found people who understand exactly what it's like to be me and i've never felt as understood with anyone irl as i have on this sub. i wish we could be one big internet family because these are the types of interactions/friendships i crave irl. but for now, have this cyber hug of appreciated, you guys are the best."
bipolar,anxiety,334,"lately i've been having this issue with how time passes. i don't seem to feel it pass. like it's ten thirty pm for me right now, and i don't feel like a day has passed. i haven't been doing anything absorbing wween setting it and the alarm. it's kind of a problem. i don't seem to realize that i'm wasting as much as i am because time doesn't register at all. has anyone else experienced this? is there anything i can do?"
anxiety,adhd,351,"i can't sit still when i get my eyebrows done, and when i'm in class i usually doodle to focus. i pay attention very well in school regardless of that, and drawing helps me focus."
anxiety,depression,352,"been in a bad way the past couple of years, stuck in a rut with no light at the end of the tunnel. there’s been many times i thought about suicide. the other day i just thought fuck it i’m making something of myself, so step 1 of that was contributing to society (get a job), step 2 is to move to a better area somewhere i can feel more happy and fulfilled. still not out of the woods yet but i’m trying given the terrible circumstances."
depression,anxiety,353,"i hate it when my ""friends"" say this. i don't know if they don't care or don't know how to help or if they genuinely believe this. i've also gotten comments like ""stop being sad"" or (for my anxiety) ""stop worrying."" i don't knk anyone will even bother to try ever again. i don't fit anywhere. i don't belong here. i feel like at this point i'm just delaying the inevitable and that, if i did go, no one would miss me. no one would even fucking notice..."
anxiety,depression,354,"my doctor and counselor have me listed as extreme anxiety and depression, early childhood ptsd, bi polar, borderline personality disorder. it's a relief to have an answer to what my problems are. this has been an on going problem my whole adult life. my first job, i had reasons for being depressed. i dropped out of school, parents were divorcing and i didn't have a stable housing situation, i was falling behind and depressed, full of anger and anxiety. i didn't want to call myself weak though and admit i had a problem, so i attempted to self medicate by escaping reality. i skateboarded, played video games, drank, smoked weed, partied, did everything i could to feel numb. 5 years later, because i didn't seek help or medication early on, i was put on suicide watch due to my new medications not worki application. my point to all this is i would be homeless and probably dead without her. she has saved my ass countless times over the years,having a mental illness makes holding a job so fucking difficult, i've lost at least 6 jobs since being with her. i have nothing but respect and love for her to be putting up with all this, while we are both still fairly young (i'm 24, she's 21 later this year) i wish her parents understood mental illness, but it's kind of a taboo in her family so we keep things as vague as possible. i just hope that i get through to disability services and can make an income that way, to relieve some stress from her life. she put off school for me from the very beginning, the least i can do is help her get through school. sorry about the rant. i hope everyone has a great day."
bipolar,depression,357,"i didn't care to do anything this year. the only reason i bought a cake is because i have a six year old. the only reason i'm posting is because... those younger than me: you'll be 31 i am finally getting self discipline down and writing my books. i couldn't even imagine this all before. i've had the ups and downs but today, i am 31, and you'll get here one day, too."
bipolar,depression,361,"i have no motivation to do anything. i don’t go to my one online class, i don’t get off of my couch except for when my dog needs me to, i can’t clean, i can’t do the laundry, my dishes are piling up, and i still can’t make myself get off of this couch. how do y’all push through? what are little things you do to get out of this?"
anxiety,depression,375,i feel drained and exhausted. every day. even when i exercise. i'm so lonely but no one ever hangs out with me or talks with me. most of my friends left and now i'm back to where i started. :/ i feel guilty to and idk why. i've never experienced this type of sadness before
anxiety,bipolar,378,"i just saw a motivational speech tonight. the speech was fine, good advice, well written. but i left it feeling so hopeless and almost in tears. here's this guy who's wealthy, driven, positive, and fit as fuck. i'm struggling to work ou i feel like a fucking negative nancy and that by not fixing that *right now,* i'm sabotaging my own life. i don't feel motivated right now. i sort of want to curl up into a ball. does anyone else react this way to motivational speeches?"
bipolar,adhd,382,"but i kept having spoonfuls of honey? i guess that wasn't enough calories how come we don't have much of an appetite when in elevated states? i've heard this happening to others too. although, once i eat something, i remember i'm actually hungry, and want more. but it's easy to forget for a rather long time.."
ptsd,anxiety,391,"slithering around, i can sometimes feel it wrapping around my thoughts. sometimes it'll tempt and induce fear that it may strike and then sit back, other times it will strangle and constrict my thoughts, biting and injecting it's venom into my thought circuit. i feel like there's an ever elusive way to drive it out of my head, that frustratingly isn't a concrete, logical method to do."
anxiety,ptsd,393,"i took the first step. i’ve been struggling so much for the past few months. it’s gotten to the point that i’m barely sleeping and when i do, i have insane nightmares. a couple weeks ago i booked a therapy appointment and it was today. i stood outside the building and came very close to just leaving because the idea of opening up about what i’m strug; if you’re wondering if you should start looking for a therapist, do it. if you’ve found a therapist that seems interesting but you’re not sure if you should reach out, do it. if you’ve made an appointment but you’re not sure if you should attend, attend it. and if you’re standing outside wondering if you should go in, go in. it will help, i promise."
none,bipolar,405,"for my job, i can take 4 weeks off at once, starting january 1st. i'm very strongly considering antartica, as my only bucket list item is to go to all 7 continents. i've been to 4 and lived in 3... checking off antartica would be a dream! what can you recommend i do? when do think is best to go? i'd most likely go alone. money is a slight consideration... but i'd go into a little credit card debt for this :]"
anxiety,none,407,"1. despite the buffoon serving as the american president, there are other elected officials and higher ups whose voices matter too. despite the words coming out of his mouth, he doesn't have a giant dashboard of buttons he can shoot missiles out of. stop watching so many movies. 2. war is costly. nobody wants it, and all tas previously threatened both guam and hawaii, and is no stranger to threats. worse situations have happened in the past. just to list a few: the cuban missile crisis, the cold war, etc. and yet we are all still here. while the situation isn't a good thing, you and your friends will be fine. carry on with your daily lives."
adhd,anxiety,415,"i recently learnt that executive dysfunction can be broken down into two main categories: anxiety that your attempt won't be satisfactory, or confusion about where to start or how to break it down into steps. as much as we feel bad about it, it's extremely important to remember that it is not laziness and we in fact shouldn't feel bad."
anxiety,depression,417,"so the title sums it up. i'm almost 28, all my friends are engaged, married or have a clatter of children. i have never even had a boyfriend in my life. i've had ""friend with benefits"" who in reality were not friends and have not benefitted me. i can see now i was used a practice girl before they moved onto women they actually care about. i have social anxiety and hate myself so expect others to hate me too. things like eye contact are very difficult. i use alcohol as a tool to try and be fun but it never really works out. not e first time in my life, he dumped me before i got that far. i'm not angry, i don't blame him, he just didn't feel the same way i do. it's left me absolutely broken. i believe im not good enough for anyone and don't see the point in going on anymore. i just go through the motions every day without feeling anything. i am on meds and see a doctor regularly but nothing helps. i tried counselling and could not talk. i have a history involving suicide and sexual assault and so trust is hard for me. i don't know where to go from here."
ptsd,anxiety,425,"i’m incredibly nervous but i’ve decided to try some medical marijuana this week. maybe next if i chicken out. something has to change. i feel like i’ve been doing whatever i can for the last two decades and plateaued with my health in the last four years or so. my medication, support system, physical activity level, and therapy are helpful but i still feel very frostrain is tailored to my issues and i trust my “bud tender” but am terrified to lose control. but i think it could be the best type of exposure therapy for me. obviously my greatest fear is losing control but having a mild experience with some mj and facing it could be helpful. or it could be really, really bad. anyone relate to this or have tried anything similar ?"
bipolar,depression,426,"i'm so bored with my life. everything i do does not give me any satisfaction whatsoever ex: trying to be social, reading, watching movies etc. i just can't pay attention nor do i really want to. all i ever want to do is sleep because i'm so bored... been sles because i really do not care to go to class because i can't even pay attention there so i feel like its a waste of time. does anyone ever feel this way? i know what depression is like but being absolutely emotionless is new... i don't really know what to do"
ptsd,depression,429,"i have this regularly and destroyed my social life once again a while back. i pushed away all people i love and lost basically every human connection. i feel like i'd just justify my behavio me. i don't think it's ever going to be any other way, so i don't care anymore. i'm starting to think that i should stay in this totally emotionless state just to stop hurting my loved ones."

ptsd,bipolar,441,"so long story short, recently i’ve been noticing i have more stomach troubles. vomiting, diarrhea, etc. yesterday i had another “stomach bug” but i noticed as soona man had gotten too close to me and i almost threw up in my car on the way home. does anyone else experience this? is this something i should tell my psychiatrist?"
bipolar,anxiety,442,"i started new meds a few weeks ago, and i think i found a good combination that works for me. i don't wake up wishing i was dead, i don't get irritable as much and i can go out in public without becoming super anxious. it's been harder to fall asleep and i have a few other small side effects, but they're not terrible. it's just nice to not be in a terrible mood 24/7. i hope others can find medications that work for them too!"
ptsd,depression,446,i eat my feelings. sometimes it's worse than others. at the moment i'm going through a bad patch and i cant stop the feeling of needing to eat. does anyone else go through this? i just want to feel less alone
bipolar,depression,448,"i live in south texas. the weather here is always humid and hot as balls, however we are finally beginning to see some weather changes. it was pouring almost all day yesterday and this morning when i walked out of my apartment to leave for work, it was fresh! fresh and cloudy and so beautiful, but then i started to feel the depression creeping in. for fuck's sake *eyerolls so fucking hard*"

ptsd,bipolar,464,i've seen three different doctors and none of them will give me my meds. i'm literally getting to the point i will just buy the pills off the internet and risk going to prison just to function. they keep trying to tell me there are other meds that help that aren't addictive. why do they keep telling me this fucking lie and why the fuck do they believe it!!! i guess i'll just drink to function because that's what these people fucking want. i want to strangle these fucking doctors.
adhd,bipolar,476,"wow, i am overwhelmed by everyone's support! let me clarify a few things with some background info: after 4 1/2 long years, i graduate in a month. in fact, last night i was finishing up my capstone project that's due today and i was having the hardest time because i put half of it off until last minute and i'm stressed the fuck out. anyway, even though i made it through college, i'm now being faced with new challenges and a shit ton of deadlines. i'm graduating in a few weeks, yet i missed a doctors appointment recently because i forgot, still have trouble with not wasting my time for hours and have two labs that are kicking my ass and i can't keep up. however, this morning i woke up to a reminder that though it's an uphill battle, especially while managing bipolar disorder, that i really am doing better than i think. whether you're freshman in the same shoes i was in four years ago, or are thriving the career you worked your ass off for, your advice, encouragement and the courage to open up have inspired the hell out of me. every single one of you. that being said, i want to share something in return that i hope will encourage you as well: i was never a model student. i dicked around in high school (on the days i actually went lol). i was your standard class clown. my grades were average, but i was always late and had to work extra hard to keep up. senior year, i accepted that since nobody believed i would make it through my first year of college, it was probably true. my first year, i was eust like your heart, meaning mental health issues should be combatted just like you would any other part of your body. you can't just one day decide that because you've changed your mindset that you don't have heart disease, just like you can't do that with adhd. obviously. the good news is, is that together, by sharing our experiences and simple solutions, we can at least all go about this knowing that we are not alone. i understand not everyone has access to resources such as medication and therapy, and i truly respect anyone who has gone without. ultimately, it is coming to the realization that you are the one who has to initially seek help, which is hard when it's hard to do anything in the first place. if you are reading this, that means you are already one step ahead because you're on this subreddit. thank you to everyone who has taken the time to share your time management solutions, love and other things you've done that have helped you with daily tasks. these are valuable insights that can truly make a difference. i took some advice i read in a comment on another thread and had a productive day yesterday. it wasn't much, my damn it was satisfying when i looked at how much i'd crossed of my to-do list. alright, so i have to get back to my project but i could not ignore the outpouring of support from my fellow adhders. also, if anyone has any questions or just needs somebody to talk to, message me. i'm so glad i found this community. remember, you're awesome. go kick today's ass. cheers"
bipolar,depression,479,"i just want to thank all the great people out there i have “met” the past few days. i felt such a sense of loneliness, and this sub has given me renewed self worth. tinues. i hope the rest of you out there are putting some good days together as well, and if you are not, know you have a friend who is ready to listen. thanks again!"
bipolar,anxiety,482,"i’m in a good place in my life right now, and i finally found a good balance of medicine and therapy, etc. but i keep getting paranoid that people around me are going to wake up one day and dislike me or want to hurt me. i know that logically, mooughts or feelings, i’ve convinced myself that everyone has trouble with that. and that someday, they’ll all leave in the same way that i walked out of people’s lives in the past. it makes it really hard to form meaningful relationships sometimes."
adhd,anxiety,486,"fuck. i can't filter out certain noises and it makes my head feel likes it's gonna explode. it makes me really anxious. i feel like everything is on maximum volume at all times and i can't put it on mute. the walls in my house are thin, and i can hear every footstep and deep voices feel like they're vibrating and it makes me want to rip my hair out. noise sensitivty feels like an itch i can't scratch. if this happens to you guys, what do you do to help it? i'm quickly going mad!"
depression,anxiety,489,"that’s the best i can explain how i feel, i guess. it’s odd, but the only thing i’ve felt for a while now, so is strangely comforting due to its consistency. i feel as if i’m very detached from my own body, and am sometimes taken aback when i see myself ieverything (sometimes called creepily observant). i don’t know how to describe it, really. justa constant star of being “out of it”. i was just curious if anyone else feels the same way? let me know if you do and we can try and explain it to each other :)"
depression,bipolar,490,"this field needs higher barriers of entry and more active policing among its members. people always say ""see a therapist!"" but man, there are a lot of fucked up and dangerous therapists out there. therapists who are mists are often dangerously unethical and creepy. be careful."" of course what ""see a therapist!"" really means is ""stop bothering me with your problems, i'm trying to watch netflix in my pajamas."" such is life, eh? /rant"
ptsd,bipolar,495,i've had them for several years and i'm passed getting suicidal/etc but it just gets really hard to breath and always ends up disabling me for a good few hours. obviously i know what's happening and that it will pass but i just need advice that will help it pass faster. i have 2 jobs and they are setting me back time wise so much and i'm just really frustrated.
bipolar,depression,499,"i've noticed a theme in my negative thoughts about myself in the last year has been a focus on this idea that i'm a failure. it's something i think all too many of you can relate to, and something i hereby challenge you to do with me. i'll do it in the comments so it doesn't overshadow your accomplishments (because i want to hear about them and be proud of you!) or turn into nk of other things i've done i can be proud of, and maybe it'll help us see some of the awesome things you've done in life that you might not appreciate for its level of awesomeness. so...what in life was hard for you that you managed to do anyway? what was something you did that's been hard for other people that wasn't hard for you? what've you worked at? stay awesome, folks."

bipolar,depression,503,"i've been depressed for two months now, and panic attacks and prolonged crying jags from this week that have left me very depleted. this time around i'm feeling just so isolated. all of my close friends are in relationships, so they don't have much time to give me extra support. i understand that i can't be a priority for my friends and family all of the time, but a text checking that i'm ok every once in a while would go a long wacticing piano and reading, and today i even cooked for myself; but i'm just so tired. life is gray right now and it's hard, and trying to bring myself out of this depression feels almost impossible. i know it'll pass...i'm just not sure when, and waiting for it to lift is painful. i want my life back, dammit. sorry for the length and self-pitying nature of this post; i just needed to get this off my chest. thanks for reading &lt;3"

ptsd,depression,514,"i seem to get so agitated sometimes, whether it’s with my family or friends, and i’m just to afraid to tell people why. i just constantly feel worthless, and i’m always on depressed and on edge. i wish i could just tell people why."
bipolar,depression,517,"title says it all. i was bombarded this morning by my boss, essentially belittling me in front of the entire office. i sucked up like the man i am, and sat down behind my desk. and then it hit how that felt. i ran to the back half of the office, stood out in secluded section of the warehouse and wept. granted it was for only about 30 seconds, i haven't felt such relief in so long."
depression,bipolar,544,"kinda shitty advice. but i'll start with some backstory. i'm on mobile so forgive me. (this will be kinda rambly) i was diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety disorder after i checked into a psychiatric hospital a few years back, but i always felt as i grew up that something was wrong. when i went to go meet my biological mother (who is very bipolar) when i was 18 things started to click with me that i needed to figure out a way to find meaning. it didn't help that my step-mom was an abusive cunt. so overall i kinda suck at being a person.(still do) anyways, i've struggled with constantly feeling down, and also feeling a whole lotta shit i didn't really understand. because of this i turned to weed and alcohol when i was 15. went through a few phases of drinking hard, but really weed was my poison of choice(still dont think it's bad but that's for another sub). again anyways because of the plant i kinda regained a sense of what it meant to be a healthy functioning member of society, but it was  pay the rent, things get complicated with family, with work, with life. and all of it together makes me wanna opt out. but then i think of leaving him by himself to deal with it himself and what a living hell that would be. even if i cant do much, ill do what i can till i can't. because if i dont that would make me sadder than anything i can ever encounter in my life. my point is that out there there are strong, amazing, incredibly intelligent and driven people, who do this shit alone. while feeling everything. and its heart breaking. my dad spent his life trying to make me feel welcome when every fiber of my being says i don't belong on this earth. the least i can do is gtfo bed and try to do something. even if my battle that day is just to brush my teeth. so that he can see a good looking smile that he made. to make him feel just a little better. that's my part, my mission. thats what gets me up. there are people that can use your help, and you owe it to them. but that s just my opinion."
anxiety,depression,545,"i feel alone and useless unless i'm high or drunk. i might be failing classes at this point, or at least close to, but i can't go to class unless i'm on something without feeling like i want to kill myself or just give up completely. i'm even high right now, i haven't been sober in over a week."
none,adhd,554,"maybe this way of saying it is fine, but when people ask around and compare test scores, i genuinely believe and want to tell people that they shouldn't focus on what other people scored but focus on themselves and their own work. i don't want to sound too formal or even rude since i am a student. so how should i reply to people asking whatever test mark i received?"
anxiety,ptsd,555,"my wife passed out from a panic attack yesterday in the theatre while we were watching *a quiet place*. i was so scared and didn't know what to do. about an hour into the movie, there's a scene where someone steps on a nail. it wasn't even very gory, but i guess it triggered some bad memories for her. a few seconds after that scene, my wife's arm started twitching kind of like a seizure. at the same time, she started making sounds like she was snoring or maybe choking. when i looked at her, her head was lolled to the side and her eyes were closed. not realizing what was happening, i nudged her a bit, thinking she had fallen asleep. when her head rolled to the other side and there wasn't any other response my concern sky-rocketed. i took her head in my hands and gently shook her a little bit trying to wake her up. her eyes partially opened, and i could see her pupils were looking up like when you roll your eyes. there was no other response. i tilted her head forward and the ""snoring"" sound stopped, but she was still unconscious. at this point, about half a minute or so had passeder feel safe. i tried to just hold her and comfort her. after about a half hour she was doing better. i felt so helpless when she was unconscious. it's very scary when you suddenly realize your loved one is having a medical emergency. later in the evening, she revealed to me that when she was a teenager, she had an abusive boyfriend that would rape her, cut her with a scalpel, and poke her with needles. sick stuff like that i guess. she wouldn't say much more about it than that. i am angry. not at her, but at the thought some sicko did this to her. and i hurt. i grieve that she has experienced something so traumatic it causes this type of thing. she agreed we will get her into some therapy. she needs healing that i never knew she needed. i also know this isn't about me, but i feel a bit hurt this is just now coming out. we've been married about 5 years, and i never knew this stuff. what else don't i know? i don't know what type of advice i'm looking for. how can i be there for her? how can i help? what do i do if this happens again? did i do the right thing both during and after?"
depression,bipolar,575,"now that i've struggles with this bullshit for 7 years, i've come to the realisation that literally no one cares no one is genuinely there for you. everyone will claim to be there for you and beg you to open up to them because they want to be the hero who 'saves'd because you just can't quite bring yourself to talk to people. going through days of mania followed by weeks of lowness and having people expect you to be okay because of those few days of mania everyone wants to be there for you until you actually show symptoms"

anxiety,ptsd,739,"i’ve had the worst week of my life. pretty much lost the will to live. my anxiety has been at a all time high since i calmed it down a while ago. as seen via my last post i got sexually assaulted nearly 7 days ago and i’ve been going off the rails ever since. i’ve barely been sober and have been promiscuous which i’ve never been before and i have no idea why after my assault all i want it for boys to respect me and say the right things before any sexual activity occurs. i had a boy say to me he wanted to get to know me before we had sex even though it was a one night stand and if it wasn’t for that nothing would of happened between us. it gave me at the time some false sense of security knowing i’m worth something and i’m not actually just a disposable machine that’s only good for one thing and that’s it? i went out last night and i’ll spare the details as about 5 dknow a few of them don’t like me that’s evident and i’m not sure why because i’ve not personally met any of them that don’t seem to like me, a lot of it has to be because of the guy i used to see and another guy i used to see who was also there. there was also drama as on friday someone slyly took a picture of me with a boy who had his arm around me who has a girlfriend (which i didn’t know) so everyone knows it’s me but they’re only not saying anything because the boy would fight all of them and probably win and his girlfriend showed up and punched him in the face and said he cheated on her, so i was quite a big topic of conversation in that apartment clearly and it’s giving me such bad anxiety i’m just worrying what people think of me and what was said about me i just don’t know what to do... i feel like i need to redeem myself but yet i’ve just done nothing wrong?"
bipolar,depression,743,"last week i wore my hair up everyday to work. not because i particularly like the way it looks, but because i couldn’t will myself the effort to take a shower for 5 days. wearing my “depression” hoodie that is 3 sizes too big, just so i can ignore my weight issue and have it’s dog hair covered fabric drape around my already dirty pajama shirt that i wore the last 4 nights. being this kind of sad is funny that way even something as mundane and rudimentary as doing my laundry takes more effort f glitter about to explode taking shots at the bar with my friends and oversharing too much with too many people this happiness turns agitated and irritable every small inconvenience feels like i might just turn green, sprout some brown shorts and call myself hulk like a rubber band that is twisting tighter and tighter until it snaps. and cuts my arm with an exacto knife and down i fall again… when people ask me how i am they should just ask me who i am today and what does my laundry look like"

depression,anxiety,979,"which is wack, because we're all a bunch of strangers hiding behind usernames. but this is such a common theme for me. for example, if someone passes me on the freeway, i immediately assume it's because that person is angry at me and wants to run me over. where is this line of thinking coming from? is it anxiety? i've been depressed for 13 years and this ""everybody hates me empirically"" has only surfaced in the last 1-2 years. anyone else deal with this?"

anxiety,depression,1016,"the older i get, the worse i seem to be at, i don't know, functioning in general. i used to be really sociable, have plenty of friends, i did well in school, had hobbies and interests - i was weird, but enough people liked me that i didn't think about it. after high school it was like the blinders were taken off and i started to see all these things about myself that i really, really hated. i started struggling a lot in social situations, i flunked out of a really good university, i couldn't hold a job, i gradually lost contact with my friends... i was a mess. but i got back up. it was a little harder than before but i still had enough momentum to keep going. i moved back to my ollet myself become. i think a big part of my problems is that i'm so used to trying and failing that i'm afraid that's the only outcome if i try again. i look at myself and think ""i've given up,"" because i have. i don't want to! but i don't know how to make life work for me anymore. i don't know how to connect with people. i go out somewhere and it's impossible to think or talk clearly through the static in my head that makes me nauseous and stutter and my heart pound. what kind of a life is one where you can't even talk to someone without turning into an idiot or crying after? i can't function like this. i'll never be able to work like this. has anyone overcome a similar situation?"

ptsd,anxiety,1122,"long story short, when i was in elementary school, i was bullied relentlessly by a kid much older than me. he used to do all kind of unpleasant shit to me, but what i hated the most was being sat on or held down and tickled until i cried. he was too strong and i was defenseless. i hated it and finally broke down and told my parents. tworld just falls down around me. now, tickling is a fairly common things between families and friends, and i'm living in constant fear of it happening. i know, it seems incredibly strange and i hate talking about it. it's so embarrassing because it seems so trivial to everyone else. i haven't even managed to say it to my therapist yet."

ptsd,anxiety,1135,"it may be bizarre to say this but ... i cannot think, i cannot feel, i cannot do anything because i am too scared to do anything because i cannot trust anyone because i feel that i am living among a world of sharks, just like in the world of game of thrones. i aood people out there and i applaud you for that but just like in the world of game of thrones, the good people always lose because is a messy, messy place that is filled and made up of lies and dirty work because somehow humanity is inherently evil, to this point"

adhd,anxiety,1147,"video games, weed, watching porn, eating fatty foods, drinking, etc. these are all things i find very hard to control. when i smoke a bit of weed i crave more instantly and i don't stop smoking until i'm baked out of my mind. whenever i'm feeling bad i start overeating, which leads to me feeling worse, which leads to more overeating. whenever i feel bored (which is quite often) i play video games. this leads to me using only video games for pleasure and to esccult emotions, and i dull myself with unhealthy behaviours, instead of just accepting the emotions and processing them in a healthy way. when i stop using these behaviours the negative thoughts and emotions start hitting me very hard. but probably that's just a phase you have to go through, to get out better on the otherside. are there others who struggle with balancing life like me? if you've found a solution, please elaborate. is this just a discipline thing?"

ptsd,depression,1419,i really need some support i’m feeling over the edge semi suicidal because i feel like i’m failing at everything. i can’t even make friends. maybe i am just a bad person. maybe everything my ex ever said was true. i just feel like such a failure and just have no enthusiasm to keep fighting. need some encouragement. i have no one.
depression,anxiety,1423,"everyday in high school i see people who can be engaged in certain classes and discussions out of what seems like interest. sometimes i see or hear about a student who went above and beyond on something. or, at the very least, i notice people who can do work and study for tests reasonably ahead of time. every time i see one of these things i feel jealous, sad, and sometimes almosly interested in any of them. college is coming next year, and i have no idea what i'm going to do, or if i even have the motivation to make it through. it's been difficult enough pretending like i care in high school. any kind of work is just a massive mental chore to get through. if it weren't for my massive anxiety and fear of falling out, i probably wouldn't get anything done."
anxiety,adhd,1426,"hey all, i've noticed recently that i've been putting things where they don't belong, or opening cabinets to look for things that i know are in another cabinet. i'm 20. sometimes i'll be walking and i'll have to ask myself ""where  constantly or i'll remember that i never went somewhere i was supposed to and then think about it and think ""wait, yes i did do that/go there."" it's really scaring the shit out of me. anyone else have these types of memory lapses?"

depression,bipolar,1430,"i really let it get out of hand this time folks. i got an email today saying i’m being excluded from my academics (meaning won’t be able to go to class...) because i didn’t pass 2 of my classes. so now, my choices are 1. talk to the dean to see if i qualify for a cancellation of exclusion, 2. get suspended, or 3. drop out of school. this really pte limit. i’m not sure if i’ll be able to take it. i can’t live with my parents again. my dad doesn’t believe in mental illness whatever that means. thinking about this situation makes me hate everything. im so done with life. i don’t know why i even try anymore. i knew i wasn’t cut out for college and i might as well give up and go waitress again"
bipolar,depression,1439,because any kind of sickness is more tolerable than depression when it gets bad. i feel guilty for being around others when i might be contagious but it's what i have to do.

depression,anxiety,1468,i've been dealing with this long enough that i'm fairly certain things aren't going to get better. medication doesn't work. talk therapy doesn't work. hitting the gym doesn't work. getting degrees in psychology doesn't work. consulting expertn't really that helpful here. i just wanted to get the thoughts out of my head and articulate them to someone other than myself. please don't tell me to call a hotline and listen to some underpaid stranger try to convince me that i'm mistaken.
ptsd,anxiety,1471,"i was 21 at the time, now i'm 22. in may of 2017, i got really sick out of no where. in a matter of 3 days, i went from feeling slightly out of it, to intense thunderclap headaches, pale, body aches, delirium, and ultimately passing out. i didn't want to make a scene or go to the hospital because i was just starting a new full time job, but i had a feeling that i was going to die. i can't really explain that very well, but i just knew deep down that someone was very wrong. at 4am i took an uber to the hospital and when i got there, upon checking my vitals (very low blood pressure and 160 resting heart rate) the nurses helped me onto a wheelchair and wheeled me into a bed in the intensive care unit. at this point, my memory is very groggy but i remember multiple people helping me take my clothes off to change me into a gown, and then doing an ecg on me. they got an iv into me and gave me a valium injection, as well as nausea medicine. i thought that was odd because i didn't feel nauseous at the time. the doctor came in and asked me what was wrong. i just cried and said my head hurt so bad, adn't push me too hard my fist few weeks back (i have a very physical job). now i'm healthier, but i still have a constant fear of getting sick again. i try to explain this to my mom and friends, but they think i'm just being dramatic and a hypochondriac. i don't feel safe anywhere but the hospital. i'm constantly scared. i don't have a fear of death, but knowing that i could easily become diseased and suffer, and leave all that i love behind makes me sad. it makes me sad that people don't understand what i went through. they are not educated on sepsis and think well ""hey, she didn't have cancer"" (my coworker actually said that, and later attributed my sepsis to being a vegetarian). i really don't talk about it a lot, but when i do, i get eye rolls. it's like people think i enjoyed taking a month off work. i constantly suffer from panic attacks now, where i feel dizzy and can't breathe well, but there's not much i can do about that. ativan doesn't help. my body and mind have been through hell and no one understands, or gives a shit. thank you for reading, i just had to get this off my chest."
bipolar,ptsd,1483,i can feel the floor dropping out like the last time i was hospitalized. i can't go back there. it was traumatic. i've tried every med and i'm terrified. i turn into a fpecting from this. i can't live like this. how do people make it? i can't believe i have to lose myself over and over until i die. i can't fucking do this. i'm so scared.
