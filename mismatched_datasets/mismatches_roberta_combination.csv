bipolar,adhd,0,"wooooo i did it! so i have been working my ass off the past 2 1/2 years to get my head back together and take a bunch of classes i needed for education endorsements so i could get into masters in teaching program. i just found out i got into the program!!! wooo i'm going to grad school! 3 years ago i could barely get out of bed, this spring i'll be learning to teach at an excellent school and i just felt like sharing with people who would get how big of a deal this is to me. i am so happy."
adhd,depression,3,"got my prescription filled any time i manage to get to the doctor and get my prescription filled before i run out of pills i have this sense like i just dodged this enormous freight train of life mangling destruction. the pharmacy i use is attached to a grocery store so for some reason the i imagine the train dressed like strange danger and its waiting for me in the cookies isle. not much else to say, just felt like sharing."
depression,ptsd,5,"i got raped twice and get bullied about it. i started to cry myself into sleep again for a week now and i don't know what to do anymore [context in the comments] i tried to post this a few times, but for reason it won't show up in the ""news feed"" and i thought it may be because the more i wrote the more i just started to vent. i am sorry if this isn't the right sub to post this and will gladly delete it if that is the case. and apologize for losing myself in writing all that down. it actually kinda helped me just to write it down and get it off my shoulders!"
bipolar,adhd,7,"forfeited all my attendance points today. third week of school. one class has an attendance policy of forfeiting all attendance points if you miss more than two classes. i mean, attendance is 40/420 pts so it could be worse. i guess. just gotta blow them away with my assignments... i’ll start by drinking this bottle of vodka. fall 2019 is not going as planned."
adhd,anxiety,16,"don't you hate it when you lose track of what you were daydreaming about and can't get back to it often times i'll get distracted from my thoughts either by external influences or just another idea coming in, and then i have to spend a good 5 minutes trying to work out what i was thinking about again."
bipolar,depression,33,"first try at spoken word writing... last week i wore my hair up everyday to work. not because i particularly like the way it looks, but because i couldn’t will myself the effort to take a shower for 5 days. wearing my “depression” hoodie that is 3 sizes too big, just so i can ignore my weight issue and have it’s dog hair covered fabric drape around my already dirty pajama shirt that i wore the last 4 nights. being this kind of sad is funny that way even something as mundane and rudimentary as doing my lke a ball of glitter about to explode taking shots at the bar with my friends and oversharing too much with too many people this happiness turns agitated and irritable every small inconvenience feels like i might just turn green, sprout some brown shorts and call myself hulk like a rubber band that is twisting tighter and tighter until it snaps. and cuts my arm with an exacto knife and down i fall again… when people ask me how i am they should just ask me who i am today and what does my laundry look like"
bipolar,depression,40,"just let me enjoy the damn weather! i live in south texas. the weather here is always humid and hot as balls, however we are finally beginning to see some weather changes. it was pouring almost all day yesterday and this morning when i walked out of my apartment to leave for work, it was fresh! fresh and cloudy and so beautiful, but then i started to feel the depression creeping in. for fuck's sake *eyerolls so fucking hard*"
anxiety,depression,43,"i bury my best friend tomorrow. i bumped into my ex with another guy. i can't deal with this. i feel sick. tomorrow i bury my best friend who tragically passed away at the age of 25. i'm heartbroken and i will be speaking at his funeral. i am happy with the speech but i am nervous, petrified to mess up. he was an incredible guy and i want to send him off well, justify what he meant to me. my ex who broke up with me 2 months ago has kept contact to ask how i have been doing and if i ever needed anything go to her. i went to the gym yesterday evening just to pass the time and maybe work off a small hangover i was nursing from the night before. i felt okay but by the end of my session i was very tired. as i was walking back towards my flat i spot my ex with a guy next to her sitting down. i could have turned around but i didn't. i go up to her and say hi, she seems shocked to see me and asks if i'm doing okay. i say no, not really and say i'll leave them to it and say goodbye. as i walk down the road my ex has caught up with me aftst before the break up about a guy who has a family that makes her laugh, feel alive. this guy has a child. i recognise him from her xmas party. i'm really confused about why she chased after me. it's obvious she cares but is she feeling guilty, trying to spare my feelings in the hardest time of my life. i do want her back in my life but seeing her with another guy hurt big time. seeing them close to each other eating ice cream. she works with him, did she like him when we were dating. i also hate the idea of her sharing her sympathy and support with other people, especially a guy like that. and it hurts to hear her say to me he's going through a hard time. i'm going through the hardest time of my life. i feel like i can't use her as a crutch. i'm so confused, hurt, a mess. i bury my best friend tomorrow . i am absolutely terrified. i feel sick, like i'm going to mess up and ruin everything. the last 2 months has been the worst of my life, it just has. i want things to be better. i want him back. i want her back. i feel terrible."
adhd,bipolar,52,forcing yourself vs. understanding your limitations? i have an issue with balance. i never know when i'm on the path to burnout until i get there because i don't know how to differentiate between pushing through for discipline or pushing myself past my limits. does that make sense? does anyone have advice?
bipolar,depression,55,"finally i have a mental health appointment tomorrow!! (please read) so after months of feeling shitty, attempting things, the mh team fobbing me off and being a shell of myself i got my gp to speak to them urgently today. after having to call them back, they said i had an appointment tomorrow lunchtime with a psych nurse which is brilliant. hopefully they can get me back to where i used to be and fast track me an appointment with the psychiatrist. perhaps i'm speaking prematurely as i've not had the appt yet but if you have a change in your mental state please try not to give up, please try and kick your mh services up the proverbial to help you. don't be another statistic, as i was so close to being. wish me luck :) p.s. if anyone needs to talk feel free to comment below &amp; i'll respond. all the best."
adhd,depression,62,"why can't i do ""unhealthy"" stuff responsibly? video games, weed, watching porn, eating fatty foods, drinking, etc. these are all things i find very hard to control. when i smoke a bit of weed i crave more instantly and i don't stop smoking until i'm baked out of my mind. whenever i'm feeling bad i start overeating, which leads to me feeling worse, which leads to more overeating. whenever i feel bored (which is quite often) i play video games. this leads to me using only vial with difficult emotions, and i dull myself with unhealthy behaviours, instead of just accepting the emotions and processing them in a healthy way. when i stop using these behaviours the negative thoughts and emotions start hitting me very hard. but probably that's just a phase you have to go through, to get out better on the otherside. are there others who struggle with balancing life like me? if you've found a solution, please elaborate. is this just a discipline thing?"
bipolar,anxiety,64,"feeling okay for once i started new meds a few weeks ago, and i think i found a good combination that works for me. i don't wake up wishing i was dead, i don't get irritable as much and i can go out in public without becoming super anxious. it's been harder to fall asleep and i have a few other small side effects, but they're not terrible. it's just nice to not be in a terrible mood 24/7. i hope others can find medications that work for them too!"
anxiety,depression,75,"succes! i passed my english class, the first thing i've completed in 7 years! posting this is extremely nerve-wracking, but hey, i'm doing it! oh. my. god. i actually did it you guys! 6 months ago my psychologist convinced me to take an online english class... i was so reluctant and was about to quit more than a handful of times, but despite crying my eyes out my psychologist wouldn't let me quit. she knew i could do it, and i'm so thankful she didn't enable me when i wanted to run the other way. i owe this woman everything. it's been 7+ years since i finished school, and this is the only thing i have accomplished since then. it was without a doubt hard and it felt impossible at times, but i'm so proud of myself now - something that rarely happens."
adhd,anxiety,80,"what learned helplessness is like just in case anyone isn't aware of what learned helplessness feels like, and as a warning to people not to keep trying the same thing over and over, i've written the following. i will use the term ""brain"" to refer to the unconscious, impulsive parts of the brain, the parts that aren't ""you"", and ""you"" to refer to your conscious experience and rational brain. (disclaimer, this is only my experience, i don't know what other people's experiences are.) --- imagine walking around, going through life, except you don't decide what you do. your brain decides everything for you and you have no say. it wants to play video games, so you play video games. that isn't to say you don't fight it, but on those occasions that you do you either are simply unable to do anything, or every frustration with yourself for every past failure floods upon you, washing your willpower away in a tidal wave of anxiety. you quickly learn the only way to fight is to not fight at all. --- now, imagine somebody calmly tells you, ""i know it's hard, but you really need to just get up and do it. i have no magic bullet unfortunately."" this is nice, they know that you have a hard time ""just doing it"" but at this point there's no way around it, it just needs to be done. you wholeheartedly agree with them, and feel like the ultimate solution _is_ to ""just do it"". your brain however immediately reminds you how ""it's never worked before, so why will it work now?"" this isn't just a small voice, it is backed by the combined anxiety of every failure and inadequacy you have ever had. --- i'll attempt to explain what lies behind this sense of hopelessness: this sense of hopelessness, in its simplest form, is the feeling that ""it's never worked, so why would it change?"" however, it goes deeper than that. the following is the main thought process: - according to other people you just need to try hard enough to solve the problem - you feel ""i just don't care anymore"" ( ditto ) - ""i hate myself"" (when i metaphorically close my eyes, cover my ears, and run from what i need to do yelling ""lalalalalalalala"", also when i am sitting doing something i enjoy and remember what i'm supposed to be doing) - ""i just can't."" (when i try to calm myself or when i'm lying in a fetal position on the bed, spiraling deeper into depression) - ""i just want the world to go away"" (this feeling makes me realize why some people kill themselves. i fortunately just retreat to my bed or some form of entertainment that allows my brain to shut off temporarily) --- i'm not saying this is permanent problem, or that there aren't any solutions, just that it's incredibly difficult, more difficult than i feel most anyone can imagine. it's the torture of hopelessness, with the frustration of fully knowing with your rational brain that hope itself is all that is needed to solve the problem, yet finding that hope hopelessly far away. please, everyone. think before you tell someone to ""just try."" they may have forgotten how to. --- edit: some people may say that you just need to build in systems, and i agree that that is a good solution, but at least for me, i've tried so many of my own systems that even trying to talk with it causes my brain to lock up with anxiety. likely because it forces me to confront all my past failures, which further discourages me from trying. i'd still love to hear any advice people have though. --- tl;dr; learned helplessness isn't thinking you are helpless, it is feeling that you've forgotten how to try. if you really wanted to try it would have worked, since people say to just try, so you must not really _want_ to try, so you begin to instead want to want to try. in addition, confronting it in any way brings with it all the anxiety of every past failure, meaning that often, instead of doing something you often fail to do you just close your eyes and hope it'll go away."
ptsd,none,84,"article on female predators (possible trigger warning) i thought i would share this article that is over on /r/science, it's a take on equalizing efforts on male victims of abuse and sexual assault, something that seems to be rather taboo in mainstream society. if you're feeling like your mental faculties are able to handle the topic, it's worth the read. may trigger, even though it's not a particularly heavy handed article."
adhd,anxiety,86,"rejuvenate just a friendly reminder to unclench your jaw, and remember it’s one day at a time. you’re doing great, and even if you’re not it’s okay. you are worthy, you are loved, and if today isn’t your day; i speak peace and warmth for your tomorrow. ❤️"
bipolar,depression,98,i feel so attached i am attached to everyone. my roommate and i have been talking so much and my friends' roommates are just awesome and i had dinner with my roommate from last year (wow so many roommates) and people from the nami club are great and obviously my best friends because i love them a lot and tch. i'm even enjoying copying fucking portraits which is tedious and uncreative but i'm having fun! and the best part about all this is that nobody thinks i'm acting abnormally despite what my psych teacher said about abnormal behaviour because theeey like meee thiss waayyyy seriously this is my personality
adhd,anxiety,108,i bit the bullet finally decided to take the plunge. i'm in the office waiting to get tested and i couldn't be more nervous. thanks for all the support guys. today i take control of my life.
ptsd,depression,110,my emotional support dog is dead i can't function. i have a test in the morning and a final exam thursday that i won't be attending. she ran away and got hit by a car and died. i don't know how i'm going to go on. i can't live without her.
bipolar,depression,113,"ugh, the demands of holiday socializing ugh, i hate how this time of year means increased social pressure. i hardly have the energy to socialize to begin with, but add all this holiday stuff on top and it wears me the hell out. went to a christmas tree decorating party this afternoon and after an hour i started fantasizing about announcing ""i have a mental illness so parties are very draining to me ... so ... yeah ... thanks so much, but i have to go now."" i did manage to last a couple more hours but now i'm soooo tired. thank heavens my husband understands."
bipolar,ptsd,117,"i feel like i’m losing it i not insured and haven’t had any treatment in a few years. i’ve mostly been hanging on with a consistent sleep schedule, exercise, eating balanced, you know, being hyper vigilant about every aspect of my life. i moved a year ago, and i know no one here. i have no support system. and i feel not in control. my thoughts run away from me. i feel like i’m going psychotic, and i don’t know how to stop it, or where to turn for help. i wish i could get committed, but i don’t have the money, and i’m have college classes i already paid for starting at the end of august. i’m just not in a good place, and i don’t have any help. part of me knows that it’s just an episode and it’ll pass eventually but i don’t know how to ride it out. and i’m afraid if i continue with no treatment it’s going to become worse."
depression,adhd,137,"you ever just feel like shit whenever someone asks how your day went, or what you have been up to recently? like you're put on the spot, and suddenly feel this pressure to sound interesting because you realize how boring your routine must appear to a third party. suddenly realizing you spend 70% of your time aimlessly browsing the same 10 subreddits, watching porn, getting high, over-sleeping, and contemplating whether it makes sense to leave your room and show your face to the public. i'm fortunate to have maybe 1-2 days per week where i can gather the energy to participate in a productive activity, and i'll try to talk that up as much as possible before the facade cracks. maybe they'll realize one day that i've never actually finished any project in which i've expressed interest. i already know that i will like myself a lot more, have better conversations, and more fulfilling relationships if i can just manage to flip this balance of time."
anxiety,ptsd,138,"morning anxiety is totally debilitating. looking for tips. my anxiety when i first wake up everyday is so strong i struggle to leave my bed. i wake up from a typically sound sleep and get thrown into a shitstorm nearly everyday. i used to have ptsd related nightmares; thankfully those have died down but it sometimes feels like all the anxiety just builds up overnight and needs to get released every morning. i feel plastered to my bed with a racing mind that i can't control. i've tried things like ""you know this will go away in an hour. just ride it out"". i've tried grounding techniques. i've tried different types of weed and different benzos. i'm thinking about doing a small meditation everyday to see how that makes me feel- are there good apps out there i could try?"
anxiety,ptsd,140,"my name is kyle im suffering from serious trauma from my past. my father beat me and molested me. he also kissed me on the lips and demeaned me treating me like a girl. every time he looked at me, itd make me feel belittled and raped. my housemate has the same insecure belittling qualities my father has. i was also beaten and emotionally manipulated by an abusive mother who beat me with a stick, only yelled and never spoke, used me to polish her ego, used me to shame my father, shamed me, embarrassed and belittled me by objectifying me and herselfwn shit, call me fat and autistic, and just release his anger any chance he could in any way he could find using me. i need to get away from all this abuse. i want to love myself for who i am and comfort myself and be there for myself and love being me. i want my life back from all the abuse. i want to absolutely own my life. right now i need comfort and love and compassion and empathy for the little boy who was first beaten by his parents and left alone feeling abused and abandoned too young to do anything about it. its okay kyle. im here for you."
ptsd,depression,143,"is it normal to miss him? i was in an abusive relationship five years ago. i forgot about most of the abuse, but something triggered my memory and everything is flooding back at once. lately i've been getting really intensive mood swings, from hating him and wishing he were dead and thinking he's the worst person on planet earth, to thinking he's the most amazing guy i've ever been with and i need his approval to be anything in life. i know i shouldn't miss him this much, and i know i'll never have any contact with him again, as he basically told me i wasn't good enough and he didn't want to talk to me again, so i don't understand what's happening or why i feel this way. does anyone else ever feel like this?"
ptsd,anxiety,145,"therapist offered to look away and it worked my new therapist has been really great. today in our third session she asked if i would be more comfortable talking if she wasn't looking at me. i'm never comfortable with eye contact so i always look away, but no one has ever noticed before that i don't like being looked at. she turned away and i looked at the wall for the whole session and it really helped! i am so glad for this. it made such a huge difference for me and i feel a lot better about our sessions in general. i feel kind of stupid but holy shit! a small thing makes a huge difference!"
bipolar,adhd,150,"my meds work well: a story in how i can’t stay up late any longer. i’m trying to stay awake to go get my boyfriend from the airport. after i realized he was going to get in waaaay later than my bedtime of 9:30, and lamented about this with my aunt. she and i concocted a plan: i’d to drive over to her house, and then she’d give me a ride to thather than being upset about my early bedtime, i’m happy that my meds are working along with my habits. it feels nice to realize that my meds are working and now i can do a bunch of work in therapy, along with petting my cats and stuff. boy, i am tired. i hope this isn’t coming off as braggy, but it felt nice to realize that this is happening."
bipolar,anxiety,158,"forgetting how to speak correctly, or at all. i'm just curious to see if this happens to anyone else; the title is pretty self explanatory. (tl;dr at bottom) i don't mean like i'm ""out of it"" or even just fatigued for the day and my brain loses its train of thought one too many times. i feel like that happens to everyone at least once in a while (including myself). i mean like it takes an insane amount of mental energy for me to say a sentence from start to finish correctly, usually takes me a few tries to do so. so to say to speak, or how to speak in general. anyone else have similar experiences? tl;dr: does anyone sometimes find their speech to be very impaired, like you feel as if you forgot how to speak at all? maybe due to an episode, personal issues, both, etc? edit: thank you so much everyone who replied to this post, sharing your experiences and such. one of my biggest insecurities is my speech (due to the issue mentioned in this post) and it's so comforting to have so much nice, supportive feedback and to know i'm not alone on this :)"
anxiety,depression,160,"motivational speakers: do they upset anyone else? i just saw a motivational speech tonight. the speech was fine, good advice, well written. but i left it feeling so hopeless and almost in tears. here's this guy who's wealthy, driven, positive, and fit as fuck. i'm struggling to work out once a week. i'm struggling with eating issues. i'm gaining weight. i feel like i'm surrounding myself with people who encourage my bad habits. i feel cruel for thinking badly of my only friends. i feel like i'm constantly treading water, just trying to keep my current achievements on par with my previous ones. i feel like a fucking negative nancy and that by not fixing that *right now,* i'm sabotaging my own life. i don't feel motivated right now. i sort of want to curl up into a ball. does anyone else react this way to motivational speeches?"
adhd,none,163,"do you guys find puns extraordinarily hilarious? while most people i know can barely muster a tired smirk, even the lamest ones keep me snorting forever. just saw someone here say ""copypasta"" and it had me rolling for minutes. and i'm actually in a horrible mood."
depression,bipolar,165,"does anyone else find it difficult to keep up with personal hygiene (brushing teeth, showering, shaving, etc) when in a depressive episode? i've been in a major depressive episode for the last two years or so and lately i find myself only brushing my teeth maybe once a day and showering only once a week. i was just wondering if anyone else struggles with this at different times during a depressive episode."
anxiety,depression,180,"i'm 18 and i feel awful unless i'm drunk or high i feel alone and useless unless i'm high or drunk. i might be failing classes at this point, or at least close to, but i can't go to class unless i'm on something without feeling like i want to kill myself or just give up completely. i'm even high right now, i haven't been sober in over a week."
bipolar,depression,182,"my father died today. or yesterday, maybe. im beginning a 20h odyssey halfway across the world to get to my father's funeral in time. the man died young, and it came out of nowhere. just numb right now, flashes of memories. going to try and stay sane for the family. wish me luck."
anxiety,ptsd,192,"i quit my job. i quit my job today. it was fucking terrible. not quitting, but being there. from september, i've had the worst time working there and trying my best for an abusive relationship. it took every fiber of my being to go through with it, but i feel like i've shed a ten ton husk. long time lurker, but i had to make an account to post this."
bipolar,anxiety,198,keep getting impulsive rapid thoughts when i'm alone. (nsfw) i've been struggling to rationalize myself right now. i have thoughts to hurt or kill myself. or walk for hundreds of miles. that my family and friends hate me that they are judging me and laughing behind my back. i feel like i constantly have to reassure myself that these perceptions aren't real. i have coursework i'm doing for an online course i really want to pass. i don't want to fail.fail.fail.fail.fail. i don't know how to control this my speech is being affected by this either too fast or slow and slurred. this anxiety has to stop now.
adhd,none,200,"do any of you ever fear people might think you are a liar because you can't remember details of anything, even things you actively enjoy? i often have people bring up songs/albums/bands or movies/tv shows during conversation. they might say, ""have you seen or heard x?"" and if i have i will say ""yeah, i liked it, enjoyed it etc etc etc"". however, as soon as they go into more details such as band members or actor names, favourite lines from movies or lyrics from songs i can't actually remember any information beyond a couple of bits even though i know i've seen/heard it and i liked it. i fear it makes me appear as a compulsive liar who says they like things just to fit in when in reality i just cannot remember many details, lines, names or lyrics, just i enjoyed said movie/show/album etc. anyone else get this? feelsbadman.jpeg."
bipolar,anxiety,201,my new cat i got a cat almost a month ago. i got him because cats have been shown to help with anxiety. his favorite thing to do was to lay on my chest and purr while knocking my phone out of my hand to have me pet him. i looked forward to coming home every day to him. i made sure to put him first and always snuggled him to show him how much i loved him. but he kept getting sick. it finds out he had an incurable autoimmune disease. notice how everything is in past tense? that's because i had to put him down an hour ago. i don't understand how life has given me this many hardships in my life and especially 2 days before my birthday. all i wanted to do was spend it with him. i really do not know what to do. i'm just really sad.
bipolar,depression,202,tfw you go to work sick so you can save your sick days for depression because any kind of sickness is more tolerable than depression when it gets bad. i feel guilty for being around others when i might be contagious but it's what i have to do.
bipolar,none,206,"i really need bernie to win i’ve been on obamacare for years, but it covers next to nothing. i can’t hold down regular employment and can’t get disability as of now. i’m rationing psych appointments and stretching meds. i’m the most stable i’ve ever been, and my pdoc is even tempted to call it “remission,” but i know all of that could change in an instant and i can’t afford any major medical bills. i’m so desperate for a medical system that i can rely on outside of employment. for me, this disability is political, plain and simple. i need relief. i need something i can count on. and for some stupid reason my future rests on the opinions of people who know nothing about me or my struggle. i just have to hope there’s enough us voters in important states out there with the same problems i have. what a broken system we’ve built for ourselves. here’s hoping for change in 2020."
bipolar,depression,218,"i had ect and it changed my life i was hospitalized over a week ago for a suicide attempt. since i've been on around 30 different meds without much results, i requested etc (electro convulsive therapy) since they did it at the hospital i was in. i got three rounds of treatment and my depression has been zapped out of my brain. i feel so much better. just had to share. :)"
ptsd,depression,221,"does it ever get better? i don't mean for this to be a huge downer, i've just been stuck in this rumination for a while now. even on my best days i feel disconnected and never able to fully live in the moment. i'm worrying about the past or future, i'm overthinking a million different moments and possibilities at once. ior 5 am. idk. i just feel like everyone is behind a glass wall can't cross. people are graduating and marrying and forming families and i just feel perpetually lost despite my efforts to get better. i think i just need a bit of hope. i'm trying though, i really am. i'm no longer on rock bottom but it's all just difficult."
depression,bipolar,224,"if you feel shitty, help someone else not feel shitty. kinda shitty advice. but i'll start with some backstory. i'm on mobile so forgive me. (this will be kinda rambly) i was diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety disorder after i checked into a psychiatric hospital a few years back, but i always felt as i grew up that something was wrong. when i went to go meet my biological mother (who is very bipolar) when i was 18 things started to click with me that i needed to figure out a way to find meaning. it didn't help that my step-mom was an abusive cunt. so overall i kinda suck at being a person.(still do) anyways, i've struggled with constantly feeling down, and also feeling a whole lotta shit i didn't really understand. because of this i turned to weed and alcohol when i was 15. went through a few phases of drinking hard, but really weed was my poison of choice(still dont think it's bad but that's for another sub). again anyways because of the plant i kinda regained a sense of what it meant to be a healthy funcnt know how we'll pay the rent, things get complicated with family, with work, with life. and all of it together makes me wanna opt out. but then i think of leaving him by himself to deal with it himself and what a living hell that would be. even if i cant do much, ill do what i can till i can't. because if i dont that would make me sadder than anything i can ever encounter in my life. my point is that out there there are strong, amazing, incredibly intelligent and driven people, who do this shit alone. while feeling everything. and its heart breaking. my dad spent his life trying to make me feel welcome when every fiber of my being says i don't belong on this earth. the least i can do is gtfo bed and try to do something. even if my battle that day is just to brush my teeth. so that he can see a good looking smile that he made. to make him feel just a little better. that's my part, my mission. thats what gets me up. there are people that can use your help, and you owe it to them. but that s just my opinion."
depression,bipolar,255,i just asked my crush to a night out. currently awaiting a response. send me your energy pls. i don’t really care what happens but i’m proud to have done this and gotten to know someone like her. first time really putting myself out there since the start of my depressive episodes. i haven’t known her for long but since i’ve met her i have constant butterflies and i feel sick almost. i knew i didn’t really have a choice other than to tr of pace for the usual stuff on this sub and thanks for the good energy :-) edit 2: hey friends she just responded like 15 hours later. she said it sounds fun and she still wanted to study later. she said she has an exam she needs to study for so she may not be able to go but all and all at least i didn’t get rejected! i’m ok with this result wish me luck guys. edit 3: i’m at the show alone and ok with it. thanks for the energy and all.
bipolar,depression,263,"not feeling after witnessing an attempted suicide i was waiting for the bus after my group ended at the outpatient clinic outside the hospital. i was walking when i saw a male, on hospital grounds near the emergency room and outpatient clinic entrance, slitting his wrists with a razor. there were people everywhere. a group of women were sitting right next to him- but they all did nothing! i ran back into the hospital and told security ab stretchers to help him. we were also across the street from a mental health emergency clinic. last week, i traveled outside the state to visit my brother who lives in a homeless shelter, and suffers from schizophrenia. i was just given a surprise diagnosis of add as well which has me worried sick. i also just celebrated my 30th birthday, but i feel like a complete mess! i don't know what to do besides remind myself 'that this will pass.'"

anxiety,none,404,"the media is profiting off people like us ok i had to make this post. the media, nowadays, lives off fear and clickbait. the scarier the headline, the more clicks that will come about. the more clicks, more money! when you read a headline, breathe in, and out. and we are the targets. the ones who legitimately have health issues surrounding world events. i was spurred on to make thisy are totally different things!! one implies trump is about to launch a full on attack onto the country, one simply reinforces what america's been saying for years, if nk attacks sk, america will defend sk. this pisses me off, it hurts me and many others physically and mentally, it affects our lives but these greedy editors and will go to the greatest lengths to make a bit more cash."

bipolar,ptsd,418,"i cried today, but out of appreciation. so, as we all know, many managers are very unforgiving and aren't very keen on helping you out when you're not doing well. most of my past managers have treated me poorly, and when i tell them of my bipolar, they scheduled me less or looked at me differently, in a bad way. my current job as a manager, i cannot allow any of my emotions to clog me. and i'm quite good at it, especially since i've been put on medications that have made me so stable i often forget to worry about mood swings. but, a while ago, i was sexually assaulted and it comes and goes in waves all the ptsd stuff. but i deal and move on. a few days ago i had a completely meltdown at work and i couldn't shake it ofknew rhat it had blown up and i was angry and upset. i told him i would need a few days in november for court and he gave a look that wasn't the standard ""i'm so sorry"" look but the ""i'm surprised i didn't know"" look. and where i was going the entire time was, he told me if i ever needed pto that i could tell him. i didn't need to tell him what the court was about, but he told me that if i needed time, let him know. this guy i've fought with since day 1 understood my situation with clarity and empathy and told me to tell him if i needed pto. i didn't think that would ever happen, but it did. i appreciate him so much more than i did before. i love being validated and understood by someone who has never experienced this."

""i don't care if you fail, i care if you try."" too fucking bad dad, i care more if i fail than if i try, and i get that that doesn't get me anywhere; it feels pretty shitty to be reminded my ridiculous rejection sensitivity makes me a terrible person. fine, impedes my success. you didn't call me a terrible person. but that's what i'm getting at. the rejection sensitivity. what amounted to ""your not trying for the sake of avoiding getting hurt disappoints and irritates me"" turned into ""you're a terrible person."" or maybe i took it to mean ""you're broken."" i often think i am. how do you think it feels when i submit 10 job applications and my brain does the same thing about not hearing back? how do you think it feels to be constantly looking at jobs trying to balance what i'm qualified for, what won't be soul-crushingly mind-numbing, and what will actually move me forward in life? and then after beating myself up to get myself to start and continue that process, getting discouraged either not hearing back or hearing i didn't get the job. and then there of performing work and am now telling myself ""you're gonna be the lazy drug using social security beneficiary nobody wants to get their money"" while i tell myself i don't deserve it because i feel like a liar. but you know what? it may hurt, **but i take it on for you**. because i acknowledge my debilitating fear of trying on the job front and would rather take on shame than let my failure to launch weigh you down. when i was growing up, i used to tell myself ""no one can hurt you more than your own family."" i think that's still true for me today. thanks dad. *do you know why i changed therapists after you got your cancer diagnosis?* **i wanted to make sure you'd be proud of me before you died.** i sure as hell don't feel like you are right now. tl;dr: my dad hurt me and pissed me off by telling me he doesn't feel like i try and expressing frustration at how much time i put into videogames (where i can at least feel successful at **something**) when i spent less time on videogames today than half of what i spend most days in general. seriously, videogaming and weight loss are the only two things i've succeeded at since graduation. maybe not dying, too, but i don't think that should count. good to know i'm a disappointment."

bipolar,depression,1430,"""1) nothing makes you happy/all you do is complain/2) everytime we talk, there's conflict, so i'm anxious whenever we speak/ 3) every time you talk, you complain."" i'm afraid of being this unhappy person who pushes people away. anyone hear else? 3 long stories; tldr at the bottom. so in the title, within quotation marks, are what i've heard from people i spent the most time with. 1) my mom, 2) a now-ex boyfriend, and 3) a former friend. 1) my mom kinda blew up in the parking lot of a hospital. the doctor said i didn't need a cough pill for my infection, and would be fine with only the prescription she gave me, and then my mom asked if she could prescribe me with a cough syrup. the doctor agreed to prescribe a strong cough syrup, and i asked if i don't need a cough pill, ""do i need cough syrup?"" the doctor said no, but said ""the medicines won't react with one another,"" and ""if you want a cough syrup, i can prescribe one."" *but i don't.* my cough won't go away (respitory infection) until the steroids kick in, but it will go away. i don't like taking meds i don't need. i'm defensive about this, because every time i have respitory issues, my mom asks the doc for a cough syrup ""for my own good"" and i feel like shit bc it's got some depressive drug in it, and i feel ultra sluggish the morning after i take it. i don't need it so i'm adverse to taking it. my mom says it's ridiculous that i have a cough and won't take a cough syrup, when no cough syrup was prescribed or suggested. the steroids will take it's course. but mothers will be mothers. i just hate taking drugs i don't actually need. (and i'm 18 so i'd think the doctor would have asked me first. guess not.) anyway she called me ungrateful and wouldn't let me speak and i dunno. it hit me. she said: ""i'm better off dead than i am alive to you, because nothing i do as your mother makes you happy."" i wanted to shoot myself in the mouth right there and then, ngl. i know that isn't the (logical) answer to this, but she isn't the only one who's said stuff like this. 2) my ldr boyfriend of two years broke up with me last night. he says he doesn't feel like he can talk to me, because he says offhanded things, and for a while, i didn't address them until months later (which is toxic). and now he feels that he'll fuck up no matter what he does, so what's the point. in the past i've addressed things as they came up and he either made fun of me, got super defensive, or asked ""so what's the problem?"". for example: he didn't speak to me for long periods of time. for like. a year. cancelled majority of skype dates at the last second. i said that i knew he has other obligations, but that still felt a bit emotionally neglected. (being left on read for days and sometimes weeks, not hearing from him for months, reading an ""i love you, too"" from him was rare. i felt like he didn't like me.) but he said that i had no reason to believe that. he had a roommate who made me cry, and he didn't defend me. even if i say that i didn't appreciate a comment, he would just join him. of course, he didn't mean to be rude, and of course he didn't mean to overlook my crying, didn't mean to misunderstand me. but he refused to buy earbuds because of his ""indispoable income"" (even if he went out to drink once a month). which gave his roommate ammo to be a bully. so i mailed my then-bf earbuds and he lost them. it felt as if he didn't put any effort into the relationship, and was justifying himself. when i asked if he wanted to break up, he sounded surprised and confused as to why. said that he loves me. i wasn't angry, just hurt and confused with all the mixed messages. but i said i believed him and ignored my gut. plus, on holidays, he drives six hundred miles in one go to visit me (and his family. so contrary to what he says, i'm not the only reason he comes to the city i live in.) but he said ""you think i wanna see my family? barely anyone there wants to see me. i'md avoiding me, too. avoiding everyone. got in a real bad funk. said uncalled for comments to me and to other people. i understand how depression can be; but that doesn't excuse her from being mean. from playing rough and with scissors (as a seventeen year old). from going out of her way to patronize people. but she put on her snapchat story her suicidal thoughts, talking about how everyone she knows is against her. so i swiped up, let her know that i apologize if i wronged her, and that i want her to be okay. that i don't think anyone is against her. that i am here if she needs to talk. she said that i can't make her pity me, and i was baffled. that she doesn't have the energy for my bullshit. (yikes.) that i shouldn't play nice if i don't feel nicely about a person. (still don't know what's she was talking about but it was childish. but still yikes.) and then she said all i do is complain about my family problems and boyfriend and do nothing to fix it. (that was when i said ""good to know,"" and blocked her. hehe.) it's so funny that she *asked me* what's wrong, didn't accept ""nothing"" for an answer, and then secretly hated when i was open and honest. i thought she was my friend. but i guess only therapists are meant to hear your problems. anyway. i digress. days after i blocked her, she came around me in person. went out of her way to sit next to me. acted fearful, as if i would reject her. took every single chance she got to be overly nice. for example: i was presenting and the class (of 13 people) was talking over me. she stood up, cupped both hands over her mouth, and projected: ""everyone! chris is talking! it is important to hear what they say, so that they can finish their presentation!"" sat down, then grinned at me. the class had the same weirded-out expression as i did. like. ugh. that was so artificial that it hurt me. i have a floridan friend who i tell some of these situations with, and he says it sounds like the other person has some unsolved problems of their own. my therapist said the same thing about all three scenarios. that nothing i complain about is like. ""i'm so sad my dad got me a blue car. i wanted a red one."" y'know? like the problems that bother me are literally ""so i'm homeless and don't know where i'm sleeping tonight "" or ""i got 27 spider bites in my sleep"" or ""my mom is threatening to kick me out and i'm an unemployed student"" or something that can't be given advice, because it's totally out of anyone's control. like when my car got totalled and i kept having flashbacks about the crash throughout the day. i couldn't sleep at night. for weeks. or when three of my classmates died. or when i was in a sexually abusive relationship for six months, got assaulted everyday on school grounds, and didn't tell anyone for eight months. i have flashbacks and awful dreams about *that* one to this day. but i don't say anything until someone asks me what's wrong. and even if they do, i'm reluctant to say so. bc none of this can be hugged better. it's heavy. it's uncomfortable and nobody wants to hear it. those are the only things that get to me. those are the things i go to therapy for. but my therapist doesn't believe in dwelling on (talking about) past traumas and griefs. i don't know what anyone wants me to do anymore. do i just let go of *everything*? i do not exagerrate; these things happened in the same twelve months. i'm not trying to excuse my complaints, but, yikes. i don't know what to make of any of this. anyway. tldr: nobody i open up to stick around. are all of these situations like. situations where both parties have made acceptable mistakes in handling their situation? or am i this unhappy person who makes people miserable because i complain so much? am i ungrateful? am i being crazy for saying the things i do? does anyone else hear statements like these from people who see you the most? it's times like these that makes self destructive behavior so easy."
anxiety,ptsd,1432,"i attended a therapy appointment today i took the first step. i’ve been struggling so much for the past few months. it’s gotten to the point that i’m barely sleeping and when i do, i have insane nightmares. a couple weeks ago i booked a therapy appointment and it was today. i stood outside the building and came very close to just leaving because the idea of opeg to say is; if you’re wondering if you should start looking for a therapist, do it. if you’ve found a therapist that seems interesting but you’re not sure if you should reach out, do it. if you’ve made an appointment but you’re not sure if you should attend, attend it. and if you’re standing outside wondering if you should go in, go in. it will help, i promise."

bipolar,none,1436,"an ode to the dirge it's happening again. time has slowed by the tiniest of fractions all the infinite of paths have become slightly less infinite, and slightly less impossible impossibility is eroding...again yesterday's tasks, which seemed so heavy, so futile, so devoid of hope are now infused with the knowledge that all tasks are as light as you make them, as important as you deem them, and hoping that this feeling can stay it's happening again. time is reminding me that it can't cease to exist the click of time's tongue can change it's tone depending on how i choose to unwrap it's gifts like friendship, it can never leave you, it can never speed up, iut at our nothingness my ego claims the well-known eyes are kinder with their gaze, but it knows better they know better i know better. it's happening again. the arena of my mind changes with each breath, with each thought from challenge to shelter to prison to dead end my arena transforms until it doesn't until it's a step behind until it's steps behind it's happening again. my mind cannot keep up with my arena my arena will not keep up with my mind the clock ticks slower now until it doesn't. time is up. the focus is narrowed. the narrowed is focused. this is all gibberish nonsense...time has changed it all. impossibility is growing. it's happened again."
adhd,none,1457,"small win made my boss smile pretty much come in at 7:50 as usual, boot up my computer. my boss rushes in which is unusual this early, asks for all stock holders for a big tech company in excel. he needs it within the next 5 mins. so lets do this copy the data, format it, even create some fast charts, print 2 copies with out being told and e-mail it to him in 4 mins. he comes in going so lets see what you got i explain the charts and the info to him. he seems impressed for the short notice. turns out he's on his way to the ceo's office with my data, and he said thanks for saving me no one else is in yet. for me was a win, did everything on time and didn't just do the minimum asked."
ptsd,anxiety,1459,i got a phone call today and im getting a call to sort out a counsellor im so happy man. i was kinda a dumb teenager who figured i could “do it myself” but now as a adult i know i can’t do that so i’m super excited to be getting help. ahhhhhh
ptsd,depression,1467,how can i accept the fact that nobody cares about me? i understand that it says more about them but i can’t help but feeling pain whenever i see yet another person that shows deliberate apathy towards me. everyone in my family and everyone i thought was my friend have been narcissistic. incapable of empathy.
ptsd,anxiety,1472,"i'm not afraid. i don't feel anything. the most i'm granted is the sick, gut churning nausea that nearly comes up but i force myself to swallow. i either feel sick, or nothing. i never truly sleep. and i wake up wishing i wouldn't. just needed to vent. thanks for listening."
ptsd,depression,1476,"anyone else live an almost entirely solitary life? outside of my husband and my mother in law, i have no one. i work from home so, no coworkers. i go grocery shopping and can do things outside the house if i need to so it’s not severe social anxiety or agoraphobia. i can have a conversation and i’m pleasant. i just honestly have no desire to have people in my life at all. i don’t want that. i don’t mind that i don’t have a single friend, aside from my husband and mother in law. i don’t mind that i probably don’t even exist to most people. in fact, it’s comforting to me to think that i don’t exist to anyone else. i don’t want anyone to think about me, or know me. i’ve even told my husband that if i die before him, please don’t have a funeral for me because i don’t even want anyone to know i’ve died, if at all possible. anyone else find themselves totally and completely okay with solitude?"
