anxiety,bipolar,0,"i am just posting this to ease the minds of people who have gad who sometimes wonder whether it is ""real"" as a disability or not or whether we are making it up, its in our heads, etc.. i came across the stat as i was writing a formal letter requesting an extension on a deadline for my section 8 voucher because of my gad. i was googling whether it was considered a disability or not (i already knew it was...), and i came across that stat which exemplifies how disabling it can be."
anxiety,depression,2,"i love how no one knows how to cope/ counter this thought. i asked my therapist but he didn't even know. he just said ""u don't work all the time"". no one knows. cause it's the truth. edit: thanks for all the awesome answers !"
anxiety,depression,9,"this is an idea i've been sitting on for about 3 months and now i'm willing to do it. i see posts about people having no friends and how making friends is hard all the time and i get it, i'm in that boat too. s yes or no, or you can spill your guts to me and i'll do my best to give you good advice or at the very least give you a ""fuck that * insert person* for being such a * insert derogatory name.*"" ok that is all :)"
bipolar,anxiety,11,i've been struggling to rationalize myself right now. i have thoughts to hurt or kill myself. or walk for hundreds of miles. that my family and friends hate me that to fail.fail.fail.fail.fail. i don't know how to control this my speech is being affected by this either too fast or slow and slurred. this anxiety has to stop now.
adhd,anxiety,12,"the two are actually quite similar, so i would definitely take a look to make sure that you are going down the right path. it is also called ""emotional dysregulation disorder"" and it includes impulsivity, trouble concence of a 3-year-old, and you lack object constancy. so basically, you are constantly suspicious and worried about a close person's emotions changing when they aren't constantly talking to you or directly in your area."
adhd,ptsd,13,ever since i can remember i've always been an extremely curious person and if i ever overheard someone talking about something like a secret or drama i would be dying to know what they were talking about and beg them to let me know too. right now i find myself absolutely torturing myself over my ex girlfriends in i grew to be such a manipulative person. so am i just nosey or you guys like this too? i also hate hate hate when someone starts to tell me something then says never mind and cuts it off. it can literally ruin the rest of my day if they refuse to tell me what they were gonna say (until i forget about it at least)
anxiety,depression,21,"thank you for reading this. i would just like to let you know that you are a wonderful, amazing person. you can do anything as long as you put your mind to it! if anyone of you reading ever need to talk, know that i am here for you. i believe in you! have a great day and don't forget to smile!"
bipolar,depression,26,"i was feeling suicidal a few weeks ago, so maybe my barometer is all messed up and this is just run-of-the-mill happy. but i kind of hope it's not. i've been med compliant for over a decade so i'm not gonna do anything _really_ stupid, but i am really tempted to let this spin out for a bit. i probably won't. but i mean....it's been fucking godawfully miserable, can i just have this one thing."
bipolar,anxiety,28,"i'm a 19 year old female, currently at university. i was diagnosed when i was 17. i have questions for those of you who are older and have lived with this disease for a long time. i feel hopeless. like i don't have a future. does it ever get better? what has helped you and what hasn't? how did you keep yourself alive all this time? do you have any advice for me?"
adhd,depression,32,thank you to this [wonderful who went waaaay out of their way to try and hurt my feelings but ended up turning a bad day into a good one because it reminded me that some people have it worse. there are people out there who only feel good when they make others feel bad and those are the people to feel truly sorry for. i'm so flattered that they saw me as a target :)
depression,ptsd,33,"my 17 year old son committed suicide six months ago. it was frustrating for me to read the top thread here today. people did care. his friends cared. his dad, me and his two brothers cared. we supported him. we got him help. we listened. we hugged him a lot. i spent hours and hours in conversation with him. it wasn't a burden. he had a unique perspective and was wise beyond his years. he was never seen as a burden. we didn't patronize him. we didn't tell him stupid nonsense. we did our best to understand. when he was having a bad stly because we miss him so much but also our resulting trauma. even so, i hold no anger towards him. i still cry every day. so much of who i was, was tied to being his mom. i'm at sea as to what meaning and purpose i now have... anyway, i wrote this to mark the anniversary of the last time i looked into his beautiful blue eyes only to see the spark that made him a compassionate, intelligent, loving soul was gone. also, to dispel the idea that all suicides happen to people who were not loved and/or supported. thank you for reading."
anxiety,depression,39,"edit: so last i heckled this was at like 40 likes and i thought “well ok. a few people feel like this so that’s nice i’m not alone.” now i know i’m not alone out there in this. thanks for the support, peeps"
depression,anxiety,52,"i feel like i almost get some weird sense of satisfaction when i'm in a cycle of self loathing. i don't feel happy during it, but there's something addicting about having that nasty inner critic voice just shit on me and my seld any resistance to it feels straining and requires a lot of mental effort. tl;dr anyone else feel a sense of catharsis when you have a spiral of negative thoughts of yourself? any tips for getting out of that cycle of thoughts?"
adhd,depression,62,"edit: i would say that a comparison to how a ""normal"" person functions is this - a normal can stand in the middle of the room and softly bounce the ball repeatedly off one wall, but i am only able to throw the ball with extra strength and it essentially shoots out of my hand and requires other walls to bounce to."
adhd,none,66,"i often have people bring up songs/albums/bands or movies/tv shows during conversation. they might say, ""have you seen or heard x?"" and if i have i will say ""yeah, i liked it, enjoyed it etc etc etc"". however,lsive liar who says they like things just to fit in when in reality i just cannot remember many details, lines, names or lyrics, just i enjoyed said movie/show/album etc. anyone else get this? feelsbadman.jpeg."
depression,anxiety,68,"i feel pretty good right now, guys. just a little bit of info, i've been self harming since i was 10. for 7 years i've never worn short sleeves outside because i was afraid that someone would find out or judge me because of it. today, i'm finally ending this cycle of self harm. i've kept myself clean and resicar wilde. all represents individuality, finality, and pride in being ""different"". these works and people kept me alive through the years. thanks for listening. i don't post often, only when i feel really, really bad. this time i'm glad to be posting something good. :) edit: here's a proper look at the tattoo:"
depression,anxiety,79,"everyone says people are wired differently. some people are more shy than others, some people are bigger than others, some are smarter etc. then there are those whose propssful? some people simply can't be happy. no matter where they are, who they are with, or what they are doing they still don't want to be here. and it really fucking sucks."
ptsd,anxiety,83,ive come to the situation where i have a brand new partner who wants to hold my hand and this is coming to a head for me again. the second this happens i start to cry and they get put off. they ask if im uncomfortable literally every time no matter the person and i have to say no because its not normal. ive tried to muscle through it but the moment the hand holding gets to hand rubbing i cry again and so on. im 19 what do you think i should do? understandably all of my relationships are very short
bipolar,adhd,89,"so i have been working my ass off the past 2 1/2 years to get my head back together and take a bunch of classes i needed for education endorsements so i could get into masters in teaching program. i just found out i got into the program!!! wooo i'm going to grad school! 3 years ago i could barely get out of bed, this spring i'll be learning to teach at an excellent school and i just felt like sharing with people who would get how big of a deal this is to me. i am so happy."
adhd,depression,95,"edit: i said this as a joke, but that was before i saw just how many people end up owing ridiculous amounts of money. i am 100% going to talk to my university library about this now."
bipolar,anxiety,96,"i was offered a full-time job recently and turned it down due to mental health concerns. time has passed, i've had time to consider things further, and my circumstances regarding treatment and my life. yes, a crap ton of stuff is going against me. but i feel like i can do this. for once, i'm taking that chance. as my best friend says, watch this space. it's about to get interesting."
ptsd,anxiety,98,"i find it hypocritical that i am sometimes called a crazy person or a freak when i tell others that i suffer from a mental disorder, while in fact, the entire world is like a planet sized mental institution with various levels of crazy. it's just that ... some forms of craziness are more acceptable than others i find it funny that the enitre world is full of crazy, and then people who are reading this os posting on this tread for help and compassion becuase we unfortunately have to through some pretty harsh and intense mental battles ... they have the luxury to call **us** crazy **edit** ... i'm sorry ... maybe crazy is too much of a strong word. maybe weird is better - we have plenty of academic fields which have their own levels of weirdness *(some of them are truly more weird than others with abstract theories and assumptions that some people still beleive like left-handed people are criminals or pathological people)* - on this year, we were shown what extreme measures some world leaders are willing to do to get what they want. discrimion - we are now, in some way, slaves of social media. wanting to post plenty, sometimes even, unnecessary posts to please others because we don't want to feel alone or rejected or even ostracized by others becuase of how the internet often involves a lot of clickbait and using it for drama or even discriminating or humiliating others becuase we simply can and then, when someone knows that i have to go through a variety of mental battles which have affected by a number of factors, could be social like my past experiences or could be biological like genetics or could be internal like a part of personality that making me act in neurotic ways ... .... but still ... i am the one who is treated as this so-called **""freak""** and probably the same treatment for many other people around the world. *(i'm sorry if this hurt you. i just wanted to get this out of my chest)* *(also, sorry if there are my grammatical errors ... i have no idea why but my mental disorders affects my language skills. i don't know why or how but it annoys me and i apologise)*"
none,adhd,100,"basically what she's been doing since she was roughly 10 years old is keep track of all the tracks and songs she liked from the first day of a year to the last, then put it aside and start on a new list. with the rto it, the smells, how you felt at that period in life. it's a great way to see how you've grown as a person. and it's not too late to start! i started in 2014, and i already appreciate it. anyways, wanted to share!"
anxiety,adhd,102,"i ordered a pizza online but after i submitted it i realized i put the wrong toppings. normally i'd just accept my fate and pick off the mushrooms i accidentally ordered, but this time i picked up the phone right away and called to correct it. thought this would be a place with some people who would understand how big of a deal that can be... woo"
anxiety,depression,104,"been in a bad way the past couple of years, stuck in a rut with no light at the end of the tunnel. there’s been many times i thought about suicide. the other day i just thought fuck it i’m making something of myself, so step 1 of that was contributing to society (get a job), step 2 is to move to a better area somewhere i can feel more happy and fulfilled. still not out of the woods yet but i’m trying given the terrible circumstances."
adhd,depression,106,"am i the only one that waste days effortlessly? like, i can plan a whole day but never do anything. i cycle through snap, ig, and youtube and get nothing done. when i do get urges to do something it’s 2/3 am but that would waste my mornings. so what do i do? i legit can’t get anything done and i hate it. people i care about look down on me and i feel worthless. i know people move at different paces to reach like goals but i don’t feel like i’m moving if i do absolutely nothing."
bipolar,anxiety,112,"just wanted to share that i finally got myself together enough to book an appointment with the therapist. i kinda stopped going and kept putting it off (it's ok i'll go next month, etc.) three years later i find myself on the edge, i'm relieved to have made the call. wish me luck!"
anxiety,ptsd,120,"i feel like i've cried a dozen times since hearing about it, watching parents speak on the news and reading tweets from the kids who went to school there (including some who were horribly killed). for some reasoke everyone else i strongly believe children should be protected and put first no matter what so things like this are just... so unspeakable. i hope the gun laws in america change for the sake of school children."
anxiety,adhd,124,"i can't sit still when i get my eyebrows done, and when i'm in class i usually doodle to focus. i pay attention very well in school regardless of that, and drawing helps me focus."
bipolar,depression,132,"i didn't care to do anything this year. the only reason i bought a cake is because i have a six year old. the only reason i'm posting is because... those younger than me: you'll be 31 i am finally getting self discipline down and writing my books. i couldn't even imagine this all before. i've had the ups and downs but today, i am 31, and you'll get here one day, too."
bipolar,depression,134,"i was recently pming with someone about relationships, heartbreak, and feeling broken and picked up on a shared sentiment. that our mental illnesses made us less deserving of love from healthy people. which my rational mind tells me is total bullshit, but it's still a sentiment i have to put effort into rejecting. it's no secret i've been investing serious time into online dating, but i think it's progress on my part that most of the time i don't feel like my mental illness disqualifies me from relationships with healthy people. i still feel like i'll be better understood by people who experience depression and whatnot and like my issues will be less of a burden to someone with their own struggles for me to give back to, but as i was thinking abouto more broken than any ""normie."" *how many of you have struggled to feel like it's okay to have relationships with healthy people, and of those of you who have, what if anything has helped you chip away at that feeling?* as broken as i've felt and as flawed as i've been, i've never been broken and i've never stopped being worth loving. there have been things about me that have made it harder to love me, like my former bmi of nearly 40 as a barrier to that kind of attracted attention, but even then i was sometimes shown that kind of love. **however broken you may feel and however unlovable you may feel, you are most certainly mistaken. you are complete and just as flawed as everyone else and worthy of love, however hard it may be to find that love.**"
ptsd,anxiety,136,"i seem to get so agitated sometimes, whether it’s with my family or friends, and i’m just to afraid to tell people why. i just constantly feel worthless, and i’m always on depressed and on edge. i wish i could just tell people why."
adhd,anxiety,137,"every time i get into an argument/ debate i’m either a second away from crying or a second away from an angry outburst. it’s so hard to keep my cool and as a result... i learned to stop talking/ people please/ avoid the topic whenever thin the rest of the day because i feel like i’ve been rejected. everytime i feel rejected i suddenly think everyone is going to abandon me, and i get stuck in that feeling. i’m learning slowly and taking my time... but god does this shit suck!"
bipolar,anxiety,143,"i feel like every time i have a conversation or try to, i’ll have em in the first half, but by the second i imagine the -2 social points from sims. it’s not just imaginary. after i get that feeling, i notice the people from those situations liking me less. i’ at me and my gut is telling me to stop and continuing on until i’ve ruined the atmosphere. telling a joke that is insensitive/being annoying/rambling/etc it feels awful because it does numbers on my reputation. it gets in the way of dating and making friends."
bipolar,anxiety,144,"hi everyone! we just want to take a moment to celebrate hitting 20,000 subscribers!!! it has been great being part of such an amazing community. i know that this sub has helped a lot of us here. feel free to comment on what you really like about this sub or how this sub has helped you."
depression,anxiety,171,i can't stand how people these days are patting themselves on the back for spreading awareness about mental health. there is still so much farther to go. we have not made nearly enough progress for complacency.
adhd,anxiety,172,"any time i manage to get to the doctor and get my prescription filled before i run out of pills i have this sense like i just dodged this enormous freight train of life mangling destruction. the pharmacy i use is attached to a grocery store so for some reason the i imagine the train dressed like strange danger and its waiting for me in the cookies isle. not much else to say, just felt like sharing."
depression,anxiety,175,"you want certian people to always be there for you but they just can't be. they're busy and have their own lives. or maybe they just don't understand how much you're going througlly maybe showed concern for my well being. i just want to spend time with someone my age who actually also wants to hangout with me, and not just me wanting to hangout with them."
bipolar,adhd,177,"i was waiting for the bus after my group ended at the outpatient clinic outside the hospital. i was walking when i saw a male, on hospital grounds near the emergency room and outpatient clinic entrance, slitting his wrists with a razor. there were people everywhere. a group of women were sitting right next to him- but they all did nothing! i ran back into the hospital and told security about the man- but they also stood thhelp him. we were also across the street from a mental health emergency clinic. last week, i traveled outside the state to visit my brother who lives in a homeless shelter, and suffers from schizophrenia. i was just given a surprise diagnosis of add as well which has me worried sick. i also just celebrated my 30th birthday, but i feel like a complete mess! i don't know what to do besides remind myself 'that this will pass.'"
depression,anxiety,185,"i tried to post this a few times, but for reason it won't show up in the ""news feed"" and i thought it may be because the more i wrote the more i just started to vent. i am sorry if this isn't the right sub to post this and will gladly delete it if that is the case. and apologize for losing myself in writing all that down. it actually kinda helped me just to write it down and get it off my shoulders!"
anxiety,depression,194,"i came into this year in a good place after years of wading through shit. i was kicking ass at my job, i have sorted a long term medical problem, i achieved dreams this winter by freeride snowboarding a mountain. i came out as bi / genderfluid to my family and it went well. but this year since then has fucked me up. i haven't touched another human in three months. i've been single for 12 years. i happening again every day recently. i don't want to see any more fucking therapists any more i hate the idea of it. i can't go through reopening all that painful old stuff again i don't want to deal with this bullshit any more. i don't want to burden my family with this, i've put them through enough. fucking 2020. its a good job i don't have a gun because its sure looking like a way to escape recently."
adhd,depression,197,"this cycle repeats itself until we/i get depressed--a low level but long lasting state of depression without swings, without strong emotions, a sort of vacant aand ashamed, but because of circumstance theres nothing that kicks us into gear. feel free to vent and support others, different perspective is good perspective!"
depression,anxiety,199,"my best friend visited my city last weekend. i found out from a facebook post about how great it was seeing all his friends. 'had a great weekend thanks to all my london friends, see everyone in a few months!' shit man. when i get married he'll be my best man, and he didn't even think to text when he spent a weekend in my city."
bipolar,ptsd,205,"i was cleaning out my closet &amp; emptying out drawers i haven’t touched in years... i found the box where i used to stash my shit. it looked like there was some 5 year old shake, my favorite old bowl, &amp; what looked like a little under a gram of coke (which still smelled potent). it definitely took me ab i know we’ve all been in dark places, but you can get out. things will get better. and one day you’ll look back and not even recognize the old you. stay faithful. keep your heads up. i hope any of you struggling with substance abuse like i was before i was diagnosed could experience what i just did one day. x"
bipolar,depression,206,"i live in south texas. the weather here is always humid and hot as balls, however we are finally beginning to see some weather changes. it was pouring almost all day yesterday and this morning when i walked out of my apartment to leave for work, it was fresh! fresh and cloudy and so beautiful, but then i started to feel the depression creeping in. for fuck's sake *eyerolls so fucking hard*"
bipolar,depression,209,i love how easy it is to go from not giving one shit about what other people think to giving all the shits. the paranoia that people are talking about me.t thought i really was just a horrible person. at least now i know that i just have a broken brain and not just a completely broken/ defective as a person.
bipolar,depression,210,"i've noticed a theme in my negative thoughts about myself in the last year has been a focus on this idea that i'm a failure. it's something i think all too many of you can relate to, and something i hereby challenge you to do with me. i'll do it in the comments so it doesn't overshadow your accomplishments (because i want to hear about them and be proud of you!) or turn into nk of other things i've done i can be proud of, and maybe it'll help us see some of the awesome things you've done in life that you might not appreciate for its level of awesomeness. so...what in life was hard for you that you managed to do anyway? what was something you did that's been hard for other people that wasn't hard for you? what've you worked at? stay awesome, folks."
depression,none,211,"i'm having a really hard time keeping up with life, especially since the lockdown started. i just don't feel like i have anything to live for. i *do not* want to be happy. i just don't understand what happiness is to be completely honest. that is not to say that i'm unhappy and miserable, what i'm saying is that happiness and sadness has become the same thing for me. i just can't separate the two. on top of that, there's this feeling of guilt i keep having about everything. i *am* from a rich family, people hot*. i just like having those kinds of imaginations. the only thing i do to keep my mind off of these feelings these days is that i listen to music. even my genres are new age, or shoegazing or doom metal, which used to be uplifting epic music. now i'm not going too much into that stuff, but i hope i've made my point clear. i'm not looking for concrete advice. perhaps simply writing these down and sharing might help me a lot. thank you for taking the time to read through this whole post. i truly appreciate it."
depression,ptsd,216,"i came home from work and my husband had moved out. we had been together for more than 15 years. no desire to discuss what went wrong, no chance of reconciliation, no warning... he was just gone. i’ve had mdd for 9 years following a traumatic brain injury. now i’m in the deepest depression i can imagine. i’ve been hospitalized. i’ve been thru 7 weeks of outpatient. i can barely get myself out of bed. i f how long until everything physically starts falling apart around me because i’m not functioning and i’m alone in this house. i try to keep it clean. i care for my pets. i try to talk to someone every day so i’m not completely isolated. i’m working part time again and slugging thru it. it’s torture. i just needed to share this with someone other than my journal. the struggle to just survive is so painful."
adhd,none,223,i just got finished with an interview and as the boss was walking me to the door he asked me what kind of music i listen to. i had absolutely no answer. i listen to music every single day. i listen toan listen to an album 100 times and not know what the album name is or what my favorite song off that album is called. it's so frustrating talking to people about music because i can't recall anything.
none,adhd,229,so i don't know where else to vent this frustration so i figure you guys will appreciate it here. i just spent the last half hour watching the ticketmaster page for bon iver's december 10th concert at the hammerstein in nyc. as soon as the timer ran out g street numbers goddamnit) and then the page loaded and said there were no more tickets. there was a maximum of 30-45 seconds between when the tickets went on sale and when i got through the security check. buying tickets is nonsense and has to be fixed.
bipolar,anxiety,230,"[screaming, crying, laughing, and vomiting - excerpts via i wish i could be ecstatic about this right now but my boyfriend broke up with me and moved out last night. not something to post about here though, that's a whole borderline personality mess between the two of us and for that specific reddit sub. anyway, here is my book. i'm gonna be working on making it into an ebook this week and buying it for myself so it can go onto amazon and other distributors."

anxiety,ptsd,254,"so the title sums it up. i'm almost 28, all my friends are engaged, married or have a clatter of children. i have never even had a boyfriend in my life. i've had ""friend with benefits"" who in reality were not friends and have not benefitted me. i can see now i was used a practice girl before they moved onto women they actually care about. i have social anxiety and hate myself so expect others to hate me too. things like eye contact are very difficult. i use alcohol as a tool to try and be fun but it never really works out. not e first time in my life, he dumped me before i got that far. i'm not angry, i don't blame him, he just didn't feel the same way i do. it's left me absolutely broken. i believe im not good enough for anyone and don't see the point in going on anymore. i just go through the motions every day without feeling anything. i am on meds and see a doctor regularly but nothing helps. i tried counselling and could not talk. i have a history involving suicide and sexual assault and so trust is hard for me. i don't know where to go from here."
bipolar,depression,258,"i wrote a post on here a bit ago about the troubles i was having with my mom and my situation has gotten a lot worse. i owe her a lot of money, they were paying for my car, phone, and treatment. basically everything. i got so angry at her that i told her to and the only plan i ever had for it was finally going through with killing myself. even at my most stable, that was always the plan. so now i'm here. the worst has finally happened. i'm trying to find reasons not to go through with my plan and can't find any."
adhd,anxiety,261,"i took my last one today, and luckily i can get the prescription one more time from the apothecary(?) before i need to have a doctor's appointment.

bipolar,depression,269,"i'm definitely in a depressed episode right now. it is easy to tell because i cry for no reason, think about hurting myself, and plan my death. i think i'm starting to notice patterns. i tend to buy and eat a lot of sweets during these times. have you noticed patterns?"
bipolar,ptsd,270,"i not insured and haven’t had any treatment in a few years. i’ve mostly been hanging on with a consistent sleep schedule, exercise, eating balanced, you know, being hyper vigilant about every aspect of my life. i moved a year ago, and i knowust. i’m just not in a good place, and i don’t have any help. part of me knows that it’s just an episode and it’ll pass eventually but i don’t know how to ride it out. and i’m afraid if i continue with no treatment it’s going to become worse."
ptsd,adhd,275,i bought a couple of bluetooth led lights from homedepot for around $15 each. through their app i setup 'schedules' that automatically dim the lights slowly on and off in till have plenty of nights of insomnia but it has helped me create a better routine and it helps so much that it happens automatically. anyone else tried something like this?
ptsd,depression,282,"i know that's a very ""wtf"" topic title, but weird times call for weird celebrations. just googled him for the first time in eons and found new news articles. now i'm just sitting here laughing at how thoroughly he's fucked up his life. probation violation :) actually, twelve of em, but who's counting? **he has** ***nothing*** **left**. he has forfeited a high-paying licensed career, almost a decade of life outside prison now, his well-kozen lives is probably never going to be happy again. :) *was it worth it, my good bitch? would you make the same life choices and still be a degenerate piece of shit...or do you regret it a lil by this point?* i'm just so fucking jazzed at this news. that violent waste of oxygen can eat shit and taste his own karma. **may all the terrible people in your life end up ruining their own lives with their gratuitously awful decisions too :)**"

anxiety,ptsd,325,"my wife passed out from a panic attack yesterday in the theatre while we were watching *a quiet place*. i was so scared and didn't know what to do. about an hour into the movie, there's a scene where someone steps on a nail. it wasn't even very gory, but i guess it triggered some bad memories for her. a few seconds after that scene, my wife's arm started twitching kind of like a seizure. at the same time, she started making sounds like she was snoring or maybe choking. when i looked at her, her head was lolled to the side and her eyes were closed. not realizing what was happening, i nudged her a bit, thinking she had fallen asleep. when her head rolled to the other side and there wasn't any other response my concern sky-rocketed. i took her head in my hands and gently shook her a little bit trying to wake her up. her eyes partially opened, and i could see her pupils were looking up like when you roll your eyes. there was no other response. i tilted her head forward and the ""snoring"" sound stopped, but she was still unconscious. at this point, about half a minute or so had passeder feel safe. i tried to just hold her and comfort her. after about a half hour she was doing better. i felt so helpless when she was unconscious. it's very scary when you suddenly realize your loved one is having a medical emergency. later in the evening, she revealed to me that when she was a teenager, she had an abusive boyfriend that would rape her, cut her with a scalpel, and poke her with needles. sick stuff like that i guess. she wouldn't say much more about it than that. i am angry. not at her, but at the thought some sicko did this to her. and i hurt. i grieve that she has experienced something so traumatic it causes this type of thing. she agreed we will get her into some therapy. she needs healing that i never knew she needed. i also know this isn't about me, but i feel a bit hurt this is just now coming out. we've been married about 5 years, and i never knew this stuff. what else don't i know? i don't know what type of advice i'm looking for. how can i be there for her? how can i help? what do i do if this happens again? did i do the right thing both during and after?"

adhd,depression,342,"**warning:** even i barely have the attention span to read this post, and i wrote it. i tried to break it up with ***~~excessive formatting.~~*** i don't think i succeeded. --- i've spent my whole life wondering why i procrastinate on things i enjoy doing. i think i've figured it out, and it's really fucking stupid. intellectually, i know that the future is a real thing. there is, in fact, a time other than now. i *know* that. but i don't *believe* it. my brain thinks time is a myth and there's no such thing as tomorrow. no matter how many times tomorrow comes, it refuses to believe that it will happen again. it's like i think the world is going to end in 15 minutes. and if the future doesn't exist, future happiness can't exist either. i should be writing right now. i enjoy writing. but i'm not currently writing, so the happiness i would derive from writing is obviously fake. ~*obviously*~. i do this shit with everything. writing, reading, talking to friends, going to the gym, throwing the ball for my dog, even playing a fucking video game. i like all those things, but at this precise moment i'm not experiencing pleasure derived from them, so it clearly can't be real. instant gratification is the only gratification i understand. if it doesn't make me happy in the next .04 seconds, it's never going to, right? that's why i spend hours dicking around on the internet. i'd enjoy going to the gym more tha the conscious person, and my brain, the subconscious asshole who's actually got the reins, can disagree on something. she doesn't get the difference between *knowing* and *believing*. and i don't get why she doesn't get it. hasn't she ever had to fight a part of herself? do normal people never feel like their brain is a separate entity that they have to fight for control? the constant struggle between your innate-but-baseless beliefs and your rationality seems like such a fundamental part of being a person. is it really not a thing for her, or am i just explaining it poorly? the part of me that tells me ""the future isn't real"" is the same part of me that screams ""you're gonna die"" every time i see a moth. both statements are wrong, and i know full well they're wrong, but that doesn't change anything. my heart rate still triples like the moth is an acid-spitting honey badger. i still fuck around like i'm frozen in time. i've been banging my head against this wall my entire goddamn life and made minimal progress. i don't think i'm making any progress now. i have no idea where to even start. i guess the moral of this rambling bitchfest is that adhd is really, really dumb. --- **tl;dr**: my adhd thinks the future is fake. i know the future is real, but i'm not in charge. i can't get started on things i enjoy because the enjoyment is in the future, which doesn't exist to me. the fuck am i supposed to do?"

ptsd,anxiety,484,"i was 21 at the time, now i'm 22. in may of 2017, i got really sick out of no where. in a matter of 3 days, i went from feeling slightly out of it, to intense thunderclap headaches, pale, body aches, delirium, and ultimately passing out. i didn't want to make a scene or go to the hospital because i was just starting a new full time job, but i had a feeling that i was going to die. i can't really explain that very well, but i just knew deep down that someone was very wrong. at 4am i took an uber to the hospital and when i got there, upon checking my vitals (very low blood pressure and 160 resting heart rate) the nurses helped me onto a wheelchair and wheeled me into a bed in the intensive care unit. at this point, my memory is very groggy but i remember multiple people helping me take my clothes off to change me into a gown, and then doing an ecg on me. they got an iv into me and gave me a valium injection, as well as nausea medicine. i thought that was odd because i didn't feel nauseous at the time. the doctor came in and asked me what was wrong. i just cried and said my head hurt so bad, adn't push me too hard my fist few weeks back (i have a very physical job). now i'm healthier, but i still have a constant fear of getting sick again. i try to explain this to my mom and friends, but they think i'm just being dramatic and a hypochondriac. i don't feel safe anywhere but the hospital. i'm constantly scared. i don't have a fear of death, but knowing that i could easily become diseased and suffer, and leave all that i love behind makes me sad. it makes me sad that people don't understand what i went through. they are not educated on sepsis and think well ""hey, she didn't have cancer"" (my coworker actually said that, and later attributed my sepsis to being a vegetarian). i really don't talk about it a lot, but when i do, i get eye rolls. it's like people think i enjoyed taking a month off work. i constantly suffer from panic attacks now, where i feel dizzy and can't breathe well, but there's not much i can do about that. ativan doesn't help. my body and mind have been through hell and no one understands, or gives a shit. thank you for reading, i just had to get this off my chest."

bipolar,adhd,834,"so last time i saw them they flat out said they don't trust me to take my meds and that even though i said i would, they don't believe me. then they told me i'm a liar because i've gone off meds before and told no one. first, yes i did go off my meds before for a lot of reasons but i always ended up getting back on them. this time i stopped for a stupid reason and i acknowledgeto take my meds without even asking why i stop them in the first place. they said they will cancel my prescription if the blood test results are low and they are not concerned that i'll be without meds. they were like, go to your gp if you like but i'll leave her a note. so i can't even go to my gp. tl;dr: i can't trust my own team anymore and i don't know where to go from here."

bipolar,adhd,857,"i've been having a weird feeling lately, a lot like what i experienced two years ago when i first went off all psych meds. i'd been on medication since i was 11, for more than half my life (most of which only made things worse) and it felt like i was seeing the world for the first time. i had missed out on so many normal teenage/early 20s experiences and there was just so much i hadn't figured out. but while i'm still not sure my medication is even helping me, the one thing i do know is that quitting drinking has given me a similar sense of clarity. not that i was drung your medication as prescribed but still abusing substances, i'll be honest and say... you're probably going to have a rough time. while i don't think complete abstinence is necessary for everyone, i feel like just not drinking at all makes things a whole lot easier for me. of course alcohol is pretty much unavoidable in our culture... and yeah, it does get lonely at times. but i don't have to stress my brain thinking about when i'm crossing the line. and that just makes everything so much easier. believe me, it's better on the other side. i'm doing good. you will too."

adhd,anxiety,971,"just in case anyone isn't aware of what learned helplessness feels like, and as a warning to people not to keep trying the same thing over and over, i've written the following. i will use the term ""brain"" to refer to the unconscious, impulsive parts of the brain, the parts that aren't ""you"", and ""you"" to refer to your conscious experience and rational brain. (disclaimer, this is only my experience, i don't know what other people's experiences are.) --- imagine walking around, going through life, except you don't decide what you do. your brain decides everything for you and you have no say. it wants to play video games, so you play video games. that isn't to say you don't fight it, but on those occasions that you do you either are simply unable to do anything, or every frustration with yourself for every past failure floods upon you, washing your willpower away in a tidal wave of anxiety. you quickly learn the only way to fight is to not fight at all. --- now, imagine somebody calmly tells you, ""i know it's hard, but you really need to just get up and do it. i have no magic bullet unfortunately."" this is nice, they know that you have a hard time ""just doing it"" but at this point there's no way around it, it just needs to be done. you wholeheartedly agree with them, and feel like the ultimate solution _is_ to ""just do it"". your brain however immediately reminds you how ""it's never worked before, so why will it work now?"" this isn't just a small voice, it is backed by the combined anxiety of every failure and inadequacy you have ever had. --- i'll attempt to explain what lies behind this sense of hopelessness: this sense of hopelessness, in its simplest form, is the feeling that ""it's never worked, so why would it change?"" however, it goes deeper than that. the following is the main thought process: - according to other people you just need to try hard enough to solve the problem - you feel like you have tried counn't care anymore"" ( ditto ) - ""i hate myself"" (when i metaphorically close my eyes, cover my ears, and run from what i need to do yelling ""lalalalalalalala"", also when i am sitting doing something i enjoy and remember what i'm supposed to be doing) - ""i just can't."" (when i try to calm myself or when i'm lying in a fetal position on the bed, spiraling deeper into depression) - ""i just want the world to go away"" (this feeling makes me realize why some people kill themselves. i fortunately just retreat to my bed or some form of entertainment that allows my brain to shut off temporarily) --- i'm not saying this is permanent problem, or that there aren't any solutions, just that it's incredibly difficult, more difficult than i feel most anyone can imagine. it's the torture of hopelessness, with the frustration of fully knowing with your rational brain that hope itself is all that is needed to solve the problem, yet finding that hope hopelessly far away. please, everyone. think before you tell someone to ""just try."" they may have forgotten how to. --- edit: some people may say that you just need to build in systems, and i agree that that is a good solution, but at least for me, i've tried so many of my own systems that even trying to talk with it causes my brain to lock up with anxiety. likely because it forces me to confront all my past failures, which further discourages me from trying. i'd still love to hear any advice people have though. --- tl;dr; learned helplessness isn't thinking you are helpless, it is feeling that you've forgotten how to try. if you really wanted to try it would have worked, since people say to just try, so you must not really _want_ to try, so you begin to instead want to want to try. in addition, confronting it in any way brings with it all the anxiety of every past failure, meaning that often, instead of doing something you often fail to do you just close your eyes and hope it'll go away."

adhd,bipolar,1006,something i see mentioned a lot in this sub is people mentioning thy carry their daily doses in pill containers on keychains instead of the prescription bottle. just wanted to remind everyone that these are controlled substances and illegal to carry without a prescription. i don charge. obviously this charge would be dismissed once you show proof of prescription but please keep this in mind. a good way to have proof on you at all times is to take a picture of your pill bottle each time you fill your prescription since you always have your phone on you.

adhd,depression,1192,"video games, weed, watching porn, eating fatty foods, drinking, etc. these are all things i find very hard to control. when i smoke a bit of weed i crave more instantly and i don't stop smoking until i'm baked out of my mind. whenever i'm feeling bad i start overeating, which leads to me feeling worse, which leads to more overeating. whenever i feel bored (which is quite often) i play video games. this leads to me using only video games for pleasure and to esccult emotions, and i dull myself with unhealthy behaviours, instead of just accepting the emotions and processing them in a healthy way. when i stop using these behaviours the negative thoughts and emotions start hitting me very hard. but probably that's just a phase you have to go through, to get out better on the otherside. are there others who struggle with balancing life like me? if you've found a solution, please elaborate. is this just a discipline thing?"

depression,bipolar,1199,"kinda shitty advice. but i'll start with some backstory. i'm on mobile so forgive me. (this will be kinda rambly) i was diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety disorder after i checked into a psychiatric hospital a few years back, but i always felt as i grew up that something was wrong. when i went to go meet my biological mother (who is very bipolar) when i was 18 things started to click with me that i needed to figure out a way to find meaning. it didn't help that my step-mom was an abusive cunt. so overall i kinda suck at being a person.(still do) anyways, i've struggled with constantly feeling down, and also feeling a whole lotta shit i didn't really understand. because of this i turned to weed and alcohol when i was 15. went through a few phases of drinking hard, but really weed was my poison of choice(still dont think it's bad but that's for another sub). again anyways because of the plant i kinda regained a sense of what it meant to be a healthy functioning member of society, but it was  pay the rent, things get complicated with family, with work, with life. and all of it together makes me wanna opt out. but then i think of leaving him by himself to deal with it himself and what a living hell that would be. even if i cant do much, ill do what i can till i can't. because if i dont that would make me sadder than anything i can ever encounter in my life. my point is that out there there are strong, amazing, incredibly intelligent and driven people, who do this shit alone. while feeling everything. and its heart breaking. my dad spent his life trying to make me feel welcome when every fiber of my being says i don't belong on this earth. the least i can do is gtfo bed and try to do something. even if my battle that day is just to brush my teeth. so that he can see a good looking smile that he made. to make him feel just a little better. that's my part, my mission. thats what gets me up. there are people that can use your help, and you owe it to them. but that s just my opinion."

adhd,bipolar,1249,"hey everyone, can we talk about a serious topic for a moment? i want to hear the community's experience on masturbation and medication. **is anybody else experiencing porn addiction or extremely long fap sessions that are hard to stop early?** --- my story: i've always had some elements of porn &amp; masturbation addiction but it never got out of hand (pun intended) nor did it ever affect my life. i wouldn't have  way to overcome it or mitigate it, but failed. this week i've started nofap since my own personal measures didn't work. if i can't fix it myself by the next time i see my psych, it's too serious for me not to tell him about all this. --- **am i the only one that experiences this? do you guys have any similar experiences?** thank you for your thoughts or anything at all. i just ask that you keep it serious. thanks."
bipolar,depression,1256,"hi everyone, i hope you are all well. i'm a filmmaker currently developing a short documentary about mental health in its various forms - depression, anxiety, bipolar, ocd, etc. it is an important subject and should always have the attention it deserves, which is the reason i'm working on it. **i messaged the mods of the forum asking if it was ok to post a series of questions to help understand how people feel about their mental health** **any responses that i get will not be used in the film. this is purely research on my part** while researching the topic, i saw a lot of films and articles that are maybe a bit 'preachy' rather than being supportive or being something that can stimulate people to talk abo have you spoken to anyone about it? does it help? * how do people treat you? have you faced stigma over mental health? * what do you want people to know about mental health? what don't they understand? * do you feel that society/social media affects your mental health (facebook/instagram etc)? * are the situations/places/times of the year that have a greater impact on your mental health? * what are your hopes for the future? again, if there is anything that makes you feel uncomfortable, then i am happy to remove it/the thread. **ultimately, the well-being and confidentiality of the users is my prime concern. i would never betray that for a film** i honestly appreciate your time for reading this post. marty"

depression,ptsd,1266,"this field needs higher barriers of entry and more active policing among its members. people always say ""see a therapist!"" but man, there are a lot of fucked up and dangerous therapists out there. therapists who are mists are often dangerously unethical and creepy. be careful."" of course what ""see a therapist!"" really means is ""stop bothering me with your problems, i'm trying to watch netflix in my pajamas."" such is life, eh? /rant"
ptsd,depression,1271,i really need some support i’m feeling over the edge semi suicidal because i feel like i’m failing at everything. i can’t even make friends. maybe i am just a bad person. maybe everything my ex ever said was true. i just feel like such a failure and just have no enthusiasm to keep fighting. need some encouragement. i have no one.
anxiety,ptsd,1274,"my doctor and counselor have me listed as extreme anxiety and depression, early childhood ptsd, bi polar, borderline personality disorder. it's a relief to have an answer to what my problems are. this has been an on going problem my whole adult life. my first job, i had reasons for being depressed. i dropped out of school, parents were divorcing and i didn't have a stable housing situation, i was falling behind and depressed, full of anger and anxiety. i didn't want to call myself weak though and admit i had a problem, so i attempted to self medicate by escaping reality. i skateboarded, played video games, drank, smoked weed, partied, did everything i could to feel numb. 5 years later, because i didn't seek help or medication early on, i was put on suicide watch due to my new medications not worki application. my point to all this is i would be homeless and probably dead without her. she has saved my ass countless times over the years,having a mental illness makes holding a job so fucking difficult, i've lost at least 6 jobs since being with her. i have nothing but respect and love for her to be putting up with all this, while we are both still fairly young (i'm 24, she's 21 later this year) i wish her parents understood mental illness, but it's kind of a taboo in her family so we keep things as vague as possible. i just hope that i get through to disability services and can make an income that way, to relieve some stress from her life. she put off school for me from the very beginning, the least i can do is help her get through school. sorry about the rant. i hope everyone has a great day."
anxiety,ptsd,1280,"i took the first step. i’ve been struggling so much for the past few months. it’s gotten to the point that i’m barely sleeping and when i do, i have insane nightmares. a couple weeks ago i booked a therapy appointment and it was today. i stood outside the building and came very close to just leaving because the idea of opening up about what i’m strug; if you’re wondering if you should start looking for a therapist, do it. if you’ve found a therapist that seems interesting but you’re not sure if you should reach out, do it. if you’ve made an appointment but you’re not sure if you should attend, attend it. and if you’re standing outside wondering if you should go in, go in. it will help, i promise."
ptsd,anxiety,1281,"i went to a pool party this weekend for a friend's birthday i made playing dnd. one of the guys there picked me up in the water, i said ""i don't like touching,"" and he dunked me. he brought me back up, and i said ""stop! i don't like touching,"" and he dunked me again. a group of his friends was standing very close and could have stopped it, but i wasn't listened to with the respect i deserved. so, this guy got to grab me, put me in a panic attack, and have a great party with no repercussions. meanwally my mother failed to believe me and extract me from a nightmarish situation. just like i did everything right at the party and a group of my so-called nerd friends left me to deal with the situation on my own. i've also been struggling with feeling like i'm making a big deal out of a small flirtatious move. but it's the speaking my boundaries and wishes and having them ignored that feels so, so much like i'm 8 again. i'm 8, and i just have to acquiesce to a man's wishes and not consider my own."
anxiety,ptsd,1285,"i’ve had the worst week of my life. pretty much lost the will to live. my anxiety has been at a all time high since i calmed it down a while ago. as seen via my last post i got sexually assaulted nearly 7 days ago and i’ve been going off the rails ever since. i’ve barely been sober and have been promiscuous which i’ve never been before and i have no idea why after my assault all i want it for boys to respect me and say the right things before any sexual activity occurs. i had a boy say to me he wanted to get to know me before we had sex even though it was a one night stand and if it wasn’t for that nothing would of happened between us. it gave me at the time some false sense of security knowing i’m worth something and i’m not actually just a disposable machine that’s only good for one thing and that’s it? i went out last night and i’ll spare the details as about 5 dknow a few of them don’t like me that’s evident and i’m not sure why because i’ve not personally met any of them that don’t seem to like me, a lot of it has to be because of the guy i used to see and another guy i used to see who was also there. there was also drama as on friday someone slyly took a picture of me with a boy who had his arm around me who has a girlfriend (which i didn’t know) so everyone knows it’s me but they’re only not saying anything because the boy would fight all of them and probably win and his girlfriend showed up and punched him in the face and said he cheated on her, so i was quite a big topic of conversation in that apartment clearly and it’s giving me such bad anxiety i’m just worrying what people think of me and what was said about me i just don’t know what to do... i feel like i need to redeem myself but yet i’ve just done nothing wrong?"

ptsd,anxiety,1290,"i typed out a whole long vent post but then realized i really just wanted to know if anyone else had the same problem. my ex is the first out of many different guys who respected my boundaries and always made sure that our sex was fully consensual. we dated for a year, broke uherapy and that i will eventually find a man i can trust, although i am worried that i'll run into the wrong men before i find him. i'm just curious - how many of you have gotten too attached to people who treated you well after your diagnosis (or after you developed symptoms)?"
none,anxiety,1291,"maybe this way of saying it is fine, but when people ask around and compare test scores, i genuinely believe and want to tell people that they shouldn't focus on what other people scored but focus on themselves and their own work. i don't want to sound too formal or even rude since i am a student. so how should i reply to people asking whatever test mark i received?"
anxiety,bipolar,1312,"sounds conceited, but i am. and nobody to talk to about it. kids dad ended up getting a damn dui with our two kids in the car. 😡 cys (child protective services) ended up coming to my house to talk to me and the kids  and i didn't even cry. everything is fine now. it wasn't as hard as i thought it was! :,) to do something that makes me proud of me... im in a happy daze. now if only i can be brave enough to leave this post up.. lol"

depression,anxiety,1340,"everyday in high school i see people who can be engaged in certain classes and discussions out of what seems like interest. sometimes i see or hear about a student who went above and beyond on something. or, at the very least, i notice people who can do work and study for tests reasonably ahead of time. every time i see one of these things i feel jealous, sad, and sometimes almosly interested in any of them. college is coming next year, and i have no idea what i'm going to do, or if i even have the motivation to make it through. it's been difficult enough pretending like i care in high school. any kind of work is just a massive mental chore to get through. if it weren't for my massive anxiety and fear of falling out, i probably wouldn't get anything done."
ptsd,depression,1349,i eat my feelings. sometimes it's worse than others. at the moment i'm going through a bad patch and i cant stop the feeling of needing to eat. does anyone else go through this? i just want to feel less alone

bipolar,ptsd,1354,"facebook seriously stresses me out. does anyone else struggle with social media? i have a hard time staying connected to friends and family because the things people post can be serious triggers for me. it doesn't matter if i'm upcycling or downcycling, something is bound to either agitate or depress me. sometimes i go on binges of unfollowing people. that doesn't help because then i don't have those connections and my feed fills up with promoted crap thaationships. i have my immediate family, and a couple of close friends (that's funny. i haven't seen them in literally a year and a half) but everyone else is an acquaintance at best. i don't even talk to my mother unless i have to, and that's after we've mended our relationship (as much as possible at this point). i'm not asking for advice, i just want to know that i'm not alone in feeling like this. do others have the same experiences? can you share some?"

bipolar,depression,1375,i simply couldn’t handle the monotony and soul crushing nature of an office job for myself....and while that may be true of being a dishwasher it’s at least more mind numbing. i feel like i failed societal expectations and my family’s as well by ending up this way but it truly is the disease. this happen to anyone else? were you able to find contentment in simpler work?

bipolar,depression,1436,"so in the title, within quotation marks, are what i've heard from people i spent the most time with. 1) my mom, 2) a now-ex boyfriend, and 3) a former friend. 1) my mom kinda blew up in the parking lot of a hospital. the doctor said i didn't need a cough pill for my infection, and would be fine with only the prescription she gave me, and then my mom asked if she could prescribe me with a cough syrup. the doctor agreed to prescribe a strong cough syrup, and i asked if i don't need a cough pill, ""do i need cough syrup?"" the doctor said no, but said ""the medicines won't react with one another,"" and ""if you want a cough syrup, i can prescribe one."" *but i don't.* my cough won't go away (respitory infection) until the steroids kick in, but it will go away. i don't like taking meds i don't need. i'm defensive about this, because every time i have respitory issues, my mom asks the doc for a cough syrup ""for my own good"" and i feel like shit bc it's got some depressive drug in it, and i feel ultra sluggish the morning after i take it. i don't need it so i'm adverse to taking it. my mom says it's ridiculous that i have a cough and won't take a cough syrup, when no cough syrup was prescribed or suggested. the steroids will take it's course. but mothers will be mothers. i just hate taking drugs i don't actually need. (and i'm 18 so i'd think the doctor would have asked me first. guess not.) anyway she called me ungrateful and wouldn't let me speak and i dunno. it hit me. she said: ""i'm better off dead than i am alive to you, because nothing i do as your mother makes you happy."" i wanted to shoot myself in the mouth right there and then, ngl. i know that isn't the (logical) answer to this, but she isn't the only one who's said stuff like this. 2) my ldr boyfriend of two years broke up with me last night. he says he doesn't feel like he can talk to me, because he says offhanded things, and for a while, i didn't address them until months later (which is toxic). and now he feels that he'll fuck up no matter what he does, so what's the point. in the past i've addressed things as they came up and he either made fun of me, got super defensive, or asked ""so what's the problem?"". for example: he didn't speak to me for long periods of time. for like. a year. cancelled majority of skype dates at the last second. i said that i knew he has other obligations, but that still felt a bit emotionally neglected. (being left on read for days and sometimes weeks, not hearing from him for months, reading an ""i love you, too"" from him was rare. i felt like he didn't like me.) but he said that i had no reason to believe that. he had a roommate who made me cry, and he didn't defend me. even if i say that i didn't appreciate a comment, he would just join him. of course, he didn't mean to be rude, and of course he didn't mean to overlook my crying, didn't mean to misunderstand me. but he refused to buy earbuds because of his ""indispoable income"" (even if he went out to drink once a month). which gave his roommate ammo to be a bully. so i mailed my then-bf earbuds and he lost them. it felt as if he didn't put any effort into the relationship, and was justifying himself. when i asked if he wanted to break up, he sounded surprised and confused as to why. said that he loves me. i wasn't angry, just hurt and confused with all the mixed messages. but i said i believed him and ignored my gut. plus, on holidays, he drives six hundred miles in one go to visit me (and his family. so contrary to what he says, i'm not the only reason he comes to the city i live in.) but he said ""you think i wanna see my family? barely anyone there wants to see me. i'm driving for nine hours straight just so see you. of course i love you."" he gave multiple examples of his responsibilities, asked if i understood, and still asked what the problem is. i couldn't teents to me and to other people. i understand how depression can be; but that doesn't excuse her from being mean. from playing rough and with scissors (as a seventeen year old). from going out of her way to patronize people. but she put on her snapchat story her suicidal thoughts, talking about how everyone she knows is against her. so i swiped up, let her know that i apologize if i wronged her, and that i want her to be okay. that i don't think anyone is against her. that i am here if she needs to talk. she said that i can't make her pity me, and i was baffled. that she doesn't have the energy for my bullshit. (yikes.) that i shouldn't play nice if i don't feel nicely about a person. (still don't know what's she was talking about but it was childish. but still yikes.) and then she said all i do is complain about my family problems and boyfriend and do nothing to fix it. (that was when i said ""good to know,"" and blocked her. hehe.) it's so funny that she *asked me* what's wrong, didn't accept ""nothing"" for an answer, and then secretly hated when i was open and honest. i thought she was my friend. but i guess only therapists are meant to hear your problems. anyway. i digress. days after i blocked her, she came around me in person. went out of her way to sit next to me. acted fearful, as if i would reject her. took every single chance she got to be overly nice. for example: i was presenting and the class (of 13 people) was talking over me. she stood up, cupped both hands over her mouth, and projected: ""everyone! chris is talking! it is important to hear what they say, so that they can finish their presentation!"" sat down, then grinned at me. the class had the same weirded-out expression as i did. like. ugh. that was so artificial that it hurt me. i have a floridan friend who i tell some of these situations with, and he says it sounds like the other person has some unsolved problems of their own. my therapist said the same thing about all three scenarios. that nothing i complain about is like. ""i'm so sad my dad got me a blue car. i wanted a red one."" y'know? like the problems that bother me are literally ""so i'm homeless and don't know where i'm sleeping tonight "" or ""i got 27 spider bites in my sleep"" or ""my mom is threatening to kick me out and i'm an unemployed student"" or something that can't be given advice, because it's totally out of anyone's control. like when my car got totalled and i kept having flashbacks about the crash throughout the day. i couldn't sleep at night. for weeks. or when three of my classmates died. or when i was in a sexually abusive relationship for six months, got assaulted everyday on school grounds, and didn't tell anyone for eight months. i have flashbacks and awful dreams about *that* one to this day. but i don't say anything until someone asks me what's wrong. and even if they do, i'm reluctant to say so. bc none of this can be hugged better. it's heavy. it's uncomfortable and nobody wants to hear it. those are the only things that get to me. those are the things i go to therapy for. but my therapist doesn't believe in dwelling on (talking about) past traumas and griefs. i don't know what anyone wants me to do anymore. do i just let go of *everything*? i do not exagerrate; these things happened in the same twelve months. i'm not trying to excuse my complaints, but, yikes. i don't know what to make of any of this. anyway. tldr: nobody i open up to stick around. are all of these situations like. situations where both parties have made acceptable mistakes in handling their situation? or am i this unhappy person who makes people miserable because i complain so much? am i ungrateful? am i being crazy for saying the things i do? does anyone else hear statements like these from people who see you the most? it's times like these that makes self destructive behavior so easy."

adhd,depression,1440,"you know that feeling when your willpower gas tank is empty, all your energy to keep pushing is burnt, and you have to take a break? getting to that point and working through makes me extremely uncomfortable, and it's the closet thing to physical pain i can imagine without actually being it. hard things cost even more energy than theyseriously when i tell him i need break, or i can't do this alone, especially when we're behind schedule on things. which is always. can anyone help me explain to him why i can't just ""buckle down and ride it out"" like he always has? edit: thank you everyone for your responses! i hope others find them as helpful to their lives as i have"

bipolar,depression,1449,"i had my goals lined up for this week in this sub. my sunday line up looked good. and yesterday for mid week checkin i was feeling good. i had one con though which was going to the bank with my mom and fixing up finances aka debt. i was proud that i held in crying in front of the awesomely nice bank consultant. had to bite my tongue a couple of times in the office. but i lost it in the car. heres what triggered me: the bank consulant was 25 with a good job thats steady. im turning 28 in a month to this day and my job is in retail re under her name, i have no idea where my checks from work go. i just quietly assume they just go on paying my debt to my parents, i have no relationship, i have no interests or passion. im sorry im just spiralling down a rabbit hole on my break from my 10 hour shift at work. the worst part was yelling at my mom when shes just trying to be there. sometimes i just feel like a raging monster. how the hell am i to be with a so in the future? thank you for reading. if i didnt vent i may not have the energy for my last 3 hours of work."
bipolar,depression,1453,"like many of you, when i get depressed i tend to stay in my room, unshowered, and pass the days bingeing on netflix, hulu or amazon prime. i canceled netflix so i could afford movie pass. (i'm on a fixed income.) it's a subscription service that allows you to see one movie a day, every day, for $10 a month. (this is not an advertisement, just an idea. i don't work for movie pass.) i spoke to my private showing. so maybe if you're like me and love movies, a subscription service may be the thing to help you leave the house. amc theaters also has a subscription service for $20 a month if you can afford that. (this is in the us). sinema has plans starting at $4.99 a month. if you love movies and want to have a motivation to leave the house once in a while, this may be a good idea for you."
bipolar,depression,1455,just like the title says lose shit and can’t remember shit most of the time just going to motions super hyper to super depressed n seconds don’t know how to talk to nobody can’t express emotions cuz it’s a billion of them hate everyone cry randomly always tired stupid tic from pass meds multiple personalities nobody understands or take the time to understand wat a great fucking life i live :/
adhd,depression,1459,"most days my depression drains me of all motivation to accomplish even the smallest tasks. and when i finally gain the motivation to work on something, i find myself distracted by something else completely irrelevant. in the end, a lot of time is wasted, and little (if anything) is accomplished. unfocused motivation is just as bad as no motivation."
anxiety,bipolar,1461,"""the evening is a time to be calm,"" they said. ""monday is the worst part of the week."" i have never related to either of these statements for as long as i can remember. for as long as i can remember, in fay have created this earth, be it humanoid or not, leaves us every sunday night between 6:00pm and the end of my waking hours. i fear that my brain is too small to comprehend the reasons for their foul play."
ptsd,anxiety,1463,"this week has been god awful, but finding this sub and being able to relate / not feel so alone is really helpful and i’m really happy that this community exists."
anxiety,depression,1464,like i hate it for two reasons because first of all it either emasculating or infantilising. and second it implies that im not doing my best or at the least not trying or sometimes it comes off as someone making light of my feelings.
bipolar,anxiety,1465,"i ordered a baby turtle! the backstory is that i had a turtle i found lost and wandering away from the water when i was about 8 and took him home and made a pet of him. he lsite you can order turtles from and finally made the jump to order a baby turtle that looks just like him. i can't wait for him to come, i can see this really cheering me up."
depression,ptsd,1466,"i live a very mediocre, sometimes even luxurious life. i’ve never been through any trauma or abuse or loss. and yet i’m severly depressed and i hate life so much. when i seor i exaggerate the somewhat bad experiences i’ve been through just so i can validate my depression. is there a name for this phenomenon? and does anyone else experience it?"
bipolar,ptsd,1467,"so i'm applying for a new job and they require a drug test. obviously i would not like my employer to know about my illnesses and i was wondering if they show and how long i would need to be off them for them to not show? hope that someone can help, ki"
bipolar,adhd,1468,"it's happening again. time has slowed by the tiniest of fractions all the infinite of paths have become slightly less infinite, and slightly less impossible impossibility is eroding...again yesterday's tasks, which seemed so heavy, so futile, so devoid of hope are now infused with the knowledge that all tasks are as light as you make them, as important as you deem them, and hoping that this feeling can stay it's happening again. time is reminding me that it can't cease to exist the click of time's tongue can change it's tone depending on how i choose to unwrap it's gifts like friendship, it can never leave you, it can never speed up, it can never enour nothingness my ego claims the well-known eyes are kinder with their gaze, but it knows better they know better i know better. it's happening again. the arena of my mind changes with each breath, with each thought from challenge to shelter to prison to dead end my arena transforms until it doesn't until it's a step behind until it's steps behind it's happening again. my mind cannot keep up with my arena my arena will not keep up with my mind the clock ticks slower now until it doesn't. time is up. the focus is narrowed. the narrowed is focused. this is all gibberish nonsense...time has changed it all. impossibility is growing. it's happened again."
anxiety,depression,1472,"i just saw a motivational speech tonight. the speech was fine, good advice, well written. but i left it feeling so hopeless and almost in tears. here's this guy who's wealthy, driven, positive, and fit as fuck. i'm struggling to work ou i feel like a fucking negative nancy and that by not fixing that *right now,* i'm sabotaging my own life. i don't feel motivated right now. i sort of want to curl up into a ball. does anyone else react this way to motivational speeches?"
depression,bipolar,1475,"i'm on the long long road to recovery and the past few months have been comparitively really stable and happy for me. i don't cry nearly as often, i'm much more productive, and much more hopeful. but the ng at me a lot yesterday and i was so close to just ending it right there, even though i know i don't really want to, and i know i'm gonna be in a better place in just over a month (going back to college)."
bipolar,anxiety,1481,"i gotta vent. dad, you've been giving mixed compliments for the past week. backhanded praise and shit. ""i don't care if you fail, i care if you try."" too fucking bad dad, i care more if i fail than if i try, and i get that that doesn't get me anywhere; it feels pretty shitty to be reminded my ridiculous rejection sensitivity makes me a terrible person. fine, impedes my success. you didn't call me a terrible person. but that's what i'm getting at. the rejection sensitivity. what amounted to ""your not trying for the sake of avoiding getting hurt disappoints and irritates me"" turned into ""you're a terrible person."" or maybe i took it to mean ""you're broken."" i often think i am. how do you think it feels when i submit 10 job applications and my brain does the same thing about not hearing back? how do you think it feels to be constantly looking at jobs trying to balance what i'm qualified for, what won't be soul-crushingly mind-numbing, and what will actually move me forward in life? and then after beating myself up to get myself to start and continue that process, getting discouraged either not hearing back or hearing i didn't get the job. and then there's: what if i actually here back? interviews are std am now telling myself ""you're gonna be the lazy drug using social security beneficiary nobody wants to get their money"" while i tell myself i don't deserve it because i feel like a liar. but you know what? it may hurt, **but i take it on for you**. because i acknowledge my debilitating fear of trying on the job front and would rather take on shame than let my failure to launch weigh you down. when i was growing up, i used to tell myself ""no one can hurt you more than your own family."" i think that's still true for me today. thanks dad. *do you know why i changed therapists after you got your cancer diagnosis?* **i wanted to make sure you'd be proud of me before you died.** i sure as hell don't feel like you are right now. tl;dr: my dad hurt me and pissed me off by telling me he doesn't feel like i try and expressing frustration at how much time i put into videogames (where i can at least feel successful at **something**) when i spent less time on videogames today than half of what i spend most days in general. seriously, videogaming and weight loss are the only two things i've succeeded at since graduation. maybe not dying, too, but i don't think that should count. good to know i'm a disappointment."
depression,adhd,1482,you know the sound a plastic cup makes when you squeeze it too hard? when you are standing and talking to people and you look normal but you are trying so hard not twhite lines running down the side from where it bent. i feel like i am making the crackling noise and i am covered in white lines. it is stupid but it seemed fitting.
anxiety,depression,1483,i haven't worked for 3 and half years due to my mental health being so bed that i couldn't face it. i worked in a stressful job but had to quit... my new non sunch etc. i am 30 years old and finally my life is getting back on track. please don't ever give up if you're struggling. you will make it out at the other end.
