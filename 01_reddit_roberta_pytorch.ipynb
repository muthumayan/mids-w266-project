(this will be kinda rambly) i was diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety disorder after i checked into a psychiatric hospital a few years back, but i always felt as i grew up that something was wrong. when i went to go meet my biological mother (who is very bipolar) when i was 18 things started to click with me that i needed to figure out a way to find meaning. it didn't help that my step-mom was an abusive cunt. so overall i kinda suck at being a person.(still do) anyways, i've struggled with constantly feeling down, and also feeling a whole lotta shit i didn't really understand. because of this i turned to weed and alcohol when i was 15. went through a few phases of drinking hard, but really weed was my poison of choice(still dont think it's bad but that's for another sub). again anyways because of the plant i kinda regained a sense of what it meant to be a healthy functioning member of society, but it was only a sense. a taste of what its like to kinda face things with some objective stoicism. a new perspective. but its a fading remedy, a bandaid. it doesn't address the core of the problem. well, new years eve 2018 i get arrested for an ounce of pot and a gram of shrooms. as i stood there with those cuffs on i couldnt help but think \\\"damn, cant catch a break..\\\" that was a low point, sitting in that cell. in my own cell with anklets as if i were the most dangerous person in there. statistically speaking i kinda was, at least the type of person most frequently shot by police, a mentally ill colored man mid 20s. but i just wanted to feel better. for the past 15 years constantly thinking of the relief dying would be. those thoughts popped right back into my head with my ass on that cold bench. how nice it would be to not be a burden to my dad. i'm tired of feeling that way and to this day i feel that way. but... a human life doesnt last that long and i know one day ill die anyways. its the only thing promised when you're born is that you'll die. so i observe those thoughts and counter them with the former. \\\"i wanna die. -you will.\\\" so how do i make this time count if none of it really matters. what do i do with this big cosmic joke of an existence? i make it worth it for my dad. we struggle. sometimes we dont know how we'll pay the rent, things get complicated with family, with work, with life. and all of it together makes me wanna opt out. but then i think of leaving him by himself to deal with it himself and what a living hell that would be. even if i cant do much, ill do what i can till i can't. because if i dont that would make me sadder than anything i can ever encounter in my life. my point is that out there there are strong, amazing, incredibly intelligent and driven people, who do this shit alone. while feeling everything. and its heart breaking. my dad spent his life trying to make me feel welcome when every fiber of my being says i don't belong on this earth. the least i can do is gtfo bed and try to do something. even if my battle that day is just to brush my teeth. so that he can see a good looking smile that he made. to make him feel just a little better. that's my part, my mission. thats what gets me up. there are people that can use your help, and you owe it to them. but that s just my opinion.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"class_name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"adhd\",\n          \"depression\",\n          \"none\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"class_id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 5,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          3,\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

(disclaimer, this is only my experience, i don\\'t know what other people\\'s experiences are.) --- imagine walking around, going through life, except you don\\'t decide what you do. your brain decides everything for you and you have no say. it wants to play video games, so you play video games. that isn\\'t to say you don\\'t fight it, but on those occasions that you do you either are simply unable to do anything, or every frustration with yourself for every past failure floods upon you, washing your willpower away in a tidal wave of anxiety. you quickly learn the only way to fight is to not fight at all. --- now, imagine somebody calmly tells you, \"i know it\\'s hard, but you really need to just get up and do it. i have no magic bullet unfortunately.\" this is nice, they know that you have a hard time \"just doing it\" but at this point there\\'s no way around it, it just needs to be done. you wholeheartedly agree with them, and feel like the ultimate solution _is_ to \"just do it\". your brain however immediately reminds you how \"it\\'s never worked before, so why will it work now?\" this isn\\'t just a small voice, it is backed by the combined anxiety of every failure and inadequacy you have ever had. --- i\\'ll attempt to explain what lies behind this sense of hopelessness: this sense of hopelessness, in its simplest form, is the feeling that \"it\\'s never worked, so why would it change?\" however, it goes deeper than that. the following is the main thought process: - according to other people you just need to try hard enough to solve the problem - you feel like you have tried countless times, but it has never worked - if your trying doesn\\'t work, you must not be trying hard enough, thus you must not _really_ want to try - your desire to try is inadequate, so your brain shifts focus from trying to the desire to try itself. so at the end, you stop wanting to try, instead your focus is diverted toward wanting to want to try. of course you didn\\'t just give up at this point, no, you tried everything at your disposal, except none of it worked. every time you tried to force yourself, you got so anxious about your own lack of ability that you either disregarded your own rules or curled up in your bed until you could forget about what you needed to do (you never really forgot, you just ignored it and it was added to the \"reasons to be hopeless\" pile) --- one day you become aware of the name of what you have: learned helplessness. you feel the first glimmer of hope in what feels like forever, you feel like now you might be able to finally control your brain! there\\'s one problem: how does one reverse learned helplessness? you realize that what seems to be the best way to reverse it is to force yourself to succeed. well, that poses a problem. you\\'ve been struggling for so long that you don\\'t know if you can succeed enough anymore to start changing how you feel. you feel like you\\'ve fallen so far down the hole there isn\\'t a single handhold nearby to pull yourself up, as if you had the strength to pull yourself up even _with_ a handhold. beyond that, for the past few years your newfound depression has been telling you how much you hate yourself every time you screw up (screwing up is quite broad according to your brain: it includes every time you remember that you should be doing something else, every time you realize you\\'re just giving in but don\\'t care any more, every time you remember how often you mess up, and more) depression and anxiety feed off of learned helplessness, which, in turn, feeds off of them. it becomes a viscous cycle where your successes are minimized, failures amplified, and problems are focused on. this in turn causes you to fail even more at getting stuff done, which makes those feelings even worse. the only way you\\'ve found to escape this cycle is to be productive, which works until you fail to do something (even a tiny insignificant thing) you should have. --- having learned helplessness, plus the depression and anxiety that come with it, the most common things my brain repeats over and over and over and over to me are the following: - \"i hate this\" (when i\\'m overwhelmed and just try to numb myself) - \"i just don\\'t care anymore\" ( ditto ) - \"i hate myself\" (when i metaphorically close my eyes, cover my ears, and run from what i need to do yelling \"lalalalalalalala\", also when i am sitting doing something i enjoy and remember what i\\'m supposed to be doing) - \"i just can\\'t.\" (when i try to calm myself or when i\\'m lying in a fetal position on the bed, spiraling deeper into depression) - \"i just want the world to go away\" (this feeling makes me realize why some people kill themselves. i fortunately just retreat to my bed or some form of entertainment that allows my brain to shut off temporarily) --- i\\'m not saying this is permanent problem, or that there aren\\'t any solutions, just that it\\'s incredibly difficult, more difficult than i feel most anyone can imagine. it\\'s the torture of hopelessness, with the frustration of fully knowing with your rational brain that hope itself is all that is needed to solve the problem, yet finding that hope hopelessly far away. please, everyone. think before you tell someone to \"just try.\" they may have forgotten how to. --- edit: some people may say that you just need to build in systems, and i agree that that is a good solution, but at least for me, i\\'ve tried so many of my own systems that even trying to talk with it causes my brain to lock up with anxiety. likely because it forces me to confront all my past failures, which further discourages me from trying. i\\'d still love to hear any advice people have though. --- tl;dr; learned helplessness isn\\'t thinking you are helpless, it is feeling that you\\'ve forgotten how to try. if you really wanted to try it would have worked, since people say to just try, so you must not really _want_ to try, so you begin to instead want to want to try. in addition, confronting it in any way brings with it all the anxiety of every past failure, meaning that often, instead of doing something you often fail to do you just close your eyes and hope it\\'ll go away.', 'text_b': None, 'label': 0}, {'guid': 46, 'text_a': 'rewatching the fellowship of the ring for the millionth time

entire night. the next day he messaged me that he was at a crisis walk in center for feeling suicidal with \"jay\". guys, i wanted to be supportive so bad but for 3 years i\\'ve been trying to get him to go to a therapist. i felt fucking useless and unappreciated and every un- you could think of. i couldn\\'t help but feel stoic and cold throughout him trying to explain. they eventually told him that he was being trasferred to a psychiatric hold. very similar to the type i was. even if it was a low risk hold i felt it in my gut and terror set in. back when i was a teenager, i had a lot of issues stemming from chemical imbalances as well as how i grew up. i had a really bad break one day and ended up downing my exes mom\\'s medication in his room. his mom (god bless her soul) got me to the hospital she worked at and i was transferred to a rehabilitation center that dealt with severe trauma. i was initially on a 72 day hold converted 14 day hold due to my silence and uncooperation throughout the entire process. honestly, they were some of the worst days of my life and it completely ruined hospitals for me. i don\\'t only panic now a days. if i\\'m in a hospital, i get nauseous and throw up due to everything that happened while i was being held. it just brings back terrible memories and terrible people i met while there. i knew i had to go and see him at the hospital to make sure he was okay. i knew i had to support his first steps towards mental health and support his parents but holy shit. i broke. the fuck. down. i cried with him because i love him of course. it hurt to see him so scared. i cried even harder in the car going home. i pulled over to a median on the freeway and just cried and screamed for what seemed to be forever because i felt so god damn terrible about having to still deal with things like this. i feel so guilty about not being 110% supportive of whats going on but i feel so fucking useless. no matter how much people say i\\'m helping, i feel so fucking selfish for wanting all of this shit to stop. earlier in the day before all this, i felt like i was breaking down because i felt so lonely it physically hurt. it felt so intense and vivid and painful and i felt so hopeless. i\\'ve made so much effort trying to counteract my symptoms by trying to put myself out there and it didn\\'t seem to work.. it made everything taste terrible. i snapped and had to ask a friend if they felt any kind of loneliness that intense just so i could gauge what was normal and he tried but it felt like it wasn\\'t remotely close. my day was already off at me wanting to accept a \"shooting in the woods\" invitation from some acquaintances so i could wander off with a gun and shoot myself where no one would find me. and then this happened. i\\'m driving over for visiting hours now after trying to call his payphone 18 times today to no avail. i bought him a card and a stuffed animal considering thats what i got when i was in care. i don\\'t know. i\\'m not ready for this. i feel so selfish i\\'m not fucking ready for this shit for the rest of my life. i don\\'t expect any advice really. i just needed to vent, but if anyone for some god

people, and things i once enjoyed. my life became small. this past february while on a family vacation i couldn’t sleep, and a week after the vacation i still couldn’t sleep. then the nightmares came.

once someone would find out my history, it would be huge red flags. i have become so used to sitting alone by myself, that i have no clue what to do even if i want to do something. i have no interest in sitting in bars or going to clubs. all i want to do is sit around and practice guitar and piano. my idea of a good time is sitting with someone playing video games, or watching netflix/youtube and discussing what we are watching, etc. i always had an interest in producing music, but i feel like i can\\'t focus on those things because they are isolated activities and i have this large looming cloud over me telling me i better get moving because i have no friends and girlfriend. i have been saving up for a downpayment on a house, and i\\'m pretty much there, but now i don\\'t even know why i want that. a house is for a family, why the hell would i want a 3 bedroom house all to myself?

[intro] [vent] [question] i\\'m new here (24, f). i\\'ve always crept on reddit for good reads about various things. it was this subreddit that got me to finally make an account. like many, i identified as an anxious person for as long as i can remember. i was in a four year relationship up until this past august in which i was depressed more often than not, or at least on the verge of depression. there were many days i couldn\\'t leave my bed and had no motivation to do anything. my ex boyfriend struggled with alcoholism and the denial of it, he was an angry drinker and damaged my self-concept pretty profoundly. when i finally was strong enough to get out of the situation, i was sleeping in my car till i found a new place to live in september, then i had no money because i poured it all into the move, i couldn\\'t buy food some days as all my dollars went into my gas tank to get to work and school. in september i also started a new job in addition to my other one, i started my clinical psychology doctoral program, and an internship. i was reunited with friends from middle/highschool after my breakup who many i hadn\\'t seen since before my undergrad career and my crappy relationship. i found myself going out every single night but still maintaining everything else in my life because i seemed to not need sleep like my peers. i engaged in risky behavior much more than ever before (excessive drinking, though i handle my liquor well, as well as unsafe sex, reckless driving, impulsive spending (particularly on travel and basically anything i wanted), etc.) i have the hardest time going home alone and often don\\'t. after only being with two people before this breakup, i\\'ve now been with 6 more, men and woman, and its only been almost 6 months. when i have sex it\\'s usually multiple times at night and then in the morning with the person. i still meet with more than one of these people to do so. between sex and alcohol and no sleep, i was starting to surprise myself with who i was becoming. as a student in the field of psychology and with experience working with others, i naturally started looking at my new behaviors and the almost \"high\" or \"stimulated\" feelings i\\'d have for days at a time. i seemed to have a newfound confidence and could appear to some as downright arrogant i feel, which is strange because i normally feel insecure and pretty self loathing after my bad relationships. it was almost like i was overcompensating to the highest degree, and i felt like i could accomplish anything, and it seemed these episodes helped me do so. i began researching bipolar but realized it wasn\\'t that severe, and then i was looking into cyclothymia. seeing as i do study at a school that is full of actual psychologists, i contacted my adviser about my thoughts and went to meet with him to get to the bottom of my behaviors and if it was something to be concerned about. he confirmed that i had hypomanic episodes followed by periods of, not depression, but low periods that seemed much more intense after coming down from them. this resonated with me, and he also identified my feelings of insecurity and emptiness that i\\'d get frequently after an episode. i did not get a diagnosis because it was apparent that instead of hindering my everyday functioning, it seems to benefit me to not need sleep and i won\\'t deny it, i love the hypomanic episodes (not so much coming down from them though). i have missed days of work/class because of these times, but not enough to cause concern i\\'d think. i just needed to get my story off my chest because there\\'s not many people i can open up to about it, one person i did already stopped talking to me because i used to seem so much more \"positive\" and \"driven\" and he doesn\\'t approve of my impulsive behaviors. this was upsetting, but i feel like he was overreacting. what are your negative repercussions like in your relationships? do you care? do you think they interpret your behaviors inaccurately or is it us that does so? will this condition get worse as i continue to welcome the episodes (i.e. by not getting sleep, engaging in impulsive behavior willingly, enjoying it, even)? how did you come to realize your hypomania/mania? what would you consider to be the point at which it is effecting my life negatively enough to seek an actual diagnosis?

house in a gorgeous and expensive city with a 6-figure career working as a computer engineer. my wife cheated on me, which resulted in our marriage ending. to prove to myself that i could make it as a provider on my own, i left an 'okay job' for what i thought would be a better opportunity. i was failing at my new job, which led me to get treated. the treatment was working, but i failed to improve in time for hr to give a fuck and they canned my ass only 4 months in to my new job. really really disheartening, because i was on an upward swing. i was really improving! vyvanse changed my life for the better! so, things i've learned: 1.) my marriage was horrifyingly co-dependent. my wife literally took care of me. i did not realize how much she did until i did not have her anymore. once i lost this unhealthy coping mechanism the house-of-cards from which i'd built my life started to collapse. 2.) since i've changed careers every 2 years, i don't have the depth of knowledge necessary to find work in this area easily. people don't seem to want a jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none. 3.) i'm behind on all of my bills. i have so much paperwork with unemployment i need to get done. i have debts that i need to get paid. i have divorce papers that i need to deal with. all of this on top of cleaning, eating, and all of that other daily stuff that there isn't enough time for. 4.) i'd be lying if i were to say that depression and anxiety weren't through the roof right now. 5.) oh yeah, and my son went to the er a while back, and i have to figure out how to make my insurance (which i also just lost...) pay for it, because i can not afford the $3000 bill they're charging me for a tube of over the counter cream. 6.) i'm so afraid of appearing as a disappointment and failure that i haven't even told my ex that i lost my job, and i won't be able to keep up child-support or alimony much longer, and that i'll probably have to move, and i'm scared to death of her reaction. i'm scared of

absolutely critical information. i'd rather fucking put a bullet in my skull than feel her wrath (this is hyperbole, i plan on living, but seriously... ugh.) there's a lot more to the story i guess,

he sometimes starves me and selfishly spends the child tax cheque on himself. when he yells at me, i usually never say anything. he can go on for an hour and i\\'d say nothing. it always just feels pointless to use my words on someone who won\\'t listen. even i say something, he\\'d tell me to shut up. my dad has slapped me a lot as a child and never stopped, but this fight was different. we were arguing in the morning, i was getting ready for school but he wanted me to do the laundry if i\\'m not attending school. i said, \"i\\'m going to school!\". he took it as if i don\\'t want to do the laundry. he threw insults at me(idiot, dependent, lazy, failure, ungrateful, ignorant, \\'stupid runaway\\'), he was guilt-tripping me, and was talking about how i\\'m a failure, he was saying i can\\'t live on my own. i started to cry because he doesn\\'t care about whatever i say, he doesn\\'t stop to apologize or try to make things work, he just wants things to always go his way. i try to please him, i try to get his approval, but you know what? i can never get it. i don\\'t even have his respect. i expressed the words, \"i don\\'t want to live here anymore...\" i always feel unsafe at my home, like an impending doom that he will go absolutely crazy and kill me someday. i want to survive and live. i know out there somewhere must be a safe and loving place... i was crying, \"i don\\'t want to live here anymore...\" i was holding my keys, and my dad came storming towards me with that terrifying murderous look in his eyes, he was trying to grab for my keys but i ran for the bathroom and tried to close the door on him. he got jammed in-between the door, and i slammed the door on his body, it looked like it hurt him, and he got more furious. he pushed the bathroom door open and it flung me onto the wall, squashing me like a sandwich. i was screaming \"fuck off!\" (i never use this language on my dad! he looked red!) his hands were crushing my tiny frail fingers, i was trying hard to hold onto my keys, but he sunk his nails into my hands, causing them to bleed. i was screaming, \"you\\'re hurting me!!\" he responds, \"you always hurt me!!!\" he got my keys and broke the keyring decorations. he walks away satisfied that he got my keys. my hands were shaking and i look at them, they\\'re dripping all over the floor. i felt like i lost my mind. i felt like that is not even my dad. so i decided to stand up for myself for once, i pushed him really hard from behind, he goes crashing and flying into some plastic rigid milk crates (we use those for holding our clothes). he was surprised, and then i started to punch him hard with my good left hand, i was punching as hard as i could, holding him down with my knee, he looked terrified. i was crying and screaming, \"you hurt me!!!\" i was punching at his body for a few times, but he stumbled and got up and just ran away holding my keys. violence solved nothing. he was still being himself. he told me to just \\'run away, get the hell out of his life\\'. i could only break into more tears. so i decided to do what he says... i packed a backpack of clothes, toothbrush/toothpaste, a book, my bus pass, stuff that should keep me out for a week unless i find a washer and dryer to wash my clothes. i managed to survive 2 days and shower and keep clean. i decided to call my dad after 2 days. he said he was sorry, and that \\'he knew that he crossed the line by making me bleed\\'. but i felt like it was a lie, and he said i don\\'t know forgiveness. that isn\\'t true, i\\'ve forgiven him many times but he still manages to continue to make these mistakes. i asked if he wants to make this work, and i made a formal proposal for respect. \"you don\\'t have to like me, you don\\'t have to love me. you just have to stop insulting me, stop fighting me, stop harassing and abusing me like this. let me be responsible for myself, stop nagging me. i can take care of myself, you must be aware that i will age, dad.\" \"no, come home tomorrow morning. you\\'ll do as i say.\" he didn\\'t take it or even listen to what i said, of course... he threatened on the phone that if i don\\'t come home, he will move out of the province and let me run away. he hung up the phone when i called him an abusive parent. he wants things to go the way he wants, he wants someone to yell at, someone to \"vent at\", someone to hurt, i\\'m just his stress ball, aren\\'t i? if he can\\'t have that, then there\\'s no deal... his common habits are lying, when i confront him about his abuse, he says i\\'m crazy and making things up in my head and tries to make me question my sanity. it doesn\\'t work, i\\'m too smart for that. i have incredible sense of memory. he can\\'t admit that he\\'s an abusive parent. it\\'s been 6 days i\\'ve been away. 2 days, i haven\\'t heard or seen from him since. i\\'m scared he\\'s packing his bags and getting ready to leave for the next province. there\\'s 20 days until i turn 18. (this is a whole separate thing, but i feel like i should include this) i have a boyfriend in ireland that i\\'ve been with for a year now, i have never met him in real life. but he wants me to live with him in ireland and get me out of this situation as fast as he can. believe me, he\\'s real, he\\'s 16 and i was friends with him for longer than 4 years. his family really wants to rescue me too. i\\'ve met his family on video calls. he wants to fly me out of canada so i can get away from my dad and be with people that love me. i think my boyfriend is tired of hearing about this... i don\\'t think it matters much if i go back home, or stay out and live on my own and go to ireland to live with my boyfriend... but i\\'d like to go home and try and see if things work out with my dad... but i don\\'t think he\\'ll change. he\\'s always been refusing to change... is this how he wants me to remember him when he dies of cancer? i want things to work with me when or if i come home... i have a bit of doubt in myself that i can live on my own... it\\'s only been 6 days, i miss my crappy bed and great computer... tl;dr: expressed the words \"i don\\'t want to live here anymore\" from all the emotional abuse, dad made my hands bleed, beat the living crap out of my old man, he told me i have a choice of whether to leave or stay, i decided to leave, i\\'m on the run(6th day), gave him a phone call and he said i have a choice to come home or he will move out of the province, or i will live completely on my own. i\\'m going to turn 18 soon. not sure what to do now, whether to come home to an abusive dad that seems unwilling to change and potentially hurt me very badly this time, or try to grow up early, get a job and keep going on the run and wait until i make it to ireland where my boyfriend resides. additional details are in the post. i\\'m sorry for the really long post! please help! edit: i feel like i should\\'ve added how i\\'m feeling about all this. i feel sad, empty, like no one wants to care for me. i feel like the only person who cares for me in my life is my boyfriend. but i\\'ve been trying really hard to stay strong throughout all this... i feel like i have no time for tears anymore, i have to keep pushing forward for change. my tears can wait for now. the next kind of tears i want are to be happy ones... i gotta keep pushing through this tough wind. i\\'m scared i\\'ll become depressed and not want to continue this one last push... i\\'m scared i\\'ll just stop and give up and not try anymore... i wish someone would tell me that i can hang in

black tbh we more identified with tribes) was 'bad'. i had no idea that how i looked meant so much till i got to the usa. i had no idea about the history of slavery, racism etc in america. oh boy, imagine arriving in a new place at age 11 and finding out all this...... moving to the usa perhaps gave us a marginally better existence materially (healthcare and education mainly) but outside of those two i found my general mental health experience worse, i missed my village, family, friends. i missed just being a girl not having to deal with so much racial politics. it was all so tirying. i hated america... in africa we did not know the names of certain mental illnesses and if someone went 'mad' we often would pray for them or perform rituals to heal them. i realise now that my father was bipolar (this is the western word for it) and my mother who would often hallucinate was schizophrenic. neither has been medicated. they chose to pray to the gods instead. when i was 16 it became apparent i was battling the same disorder as my mother and my mother took me around to see people from our country (here in the usa) to pray for me. it never worked. i was still very ill. i'd have psychotic breaks from time to time and episodes. when i was 18 it became apparent if i could not do the 'good immigrant' thing like go to college to study stem i had to somehow go out and provide for myself. i went out and tried, i worked in retail, call centres, tried trade school...i wasn't very good at many of them. racism was complex. i learned very quickly that it worked in and out of my favour. by 19 i was aware i had these 'fetishist' who would follow me around. i was tall 5ft8, slim etc and i'd constantly have men propositioning me to pay for sex. i found my place in the sex work

mumble, and talk super fast. plenty of the girls at my school share interests with me that i'd love to talk about, but i have no idea how to bring them up to people without coming off as incredibly awkward. plus, i never want to admit any of my interests to people, anyway. be it bands, video games, or what i like to watch on youtube, i won't tell anyone anything about it. i've even started to

all she was told was this week. i have had multiple breakdowns over this whole situation over the weekend, but i haven\\'t checked out yet. i know that will only solve the problem for me. she has had a couple of her meds changed and she was finally started on an anti depressant today. i know i am blessed that she didn\\'t succeed in her attempt; however my heart aches for my wife. edit v: if anyone is still interested in this thread or not. i\\'m editing because i\\'m happy. both of us spent the past few days guarded \\'ly\\' optimistic. however she is coming home tomorrow morning. just

quietly get up and leave the room. she didn\\'t sign up for this shit. the worst, however, came when we split. i told her the thought of waking up and not seeing my boy in the morning anymore was making me want to jump on the train tracks. i needed help to make this transition easier. for the first time since his birth, she was comforting. assured me we could make it easy on the two of us. she didn\\'t hate me and i wasn\\'t sick or broken. i woke up the next morning hopeful that this drastic change in my life would be overcome. after i left for work she took my son out of daycare and fled the state to go stay with her mother. she said \"i don\\'t know what people with your condition are capable of.\" she finally came back 6 days later with him but still, to this day, insists she

hobbies as if tomorrow would never come. now it\\'s as if i\\'m always living in tomorrow, never the present. i lost my mother at 14 years old to a fatal asthma attack. from there i started pushing everyone away because i just couldn\\'t be happy and carefree like everyone else was. their problems seemed so small and i couldn\\'t stand what normal people considered a \"bad day\". it began to sicken me, and i became envious and angry at everyone. i discovered marijuana shortly after my mom passed and it was a godsend. i could escape to a place where i felt content with everything and everyone. when i was 19 i met the woman of my dreams and we moved in together. i continued to experiment with drugs and eventually it led to me trying methamphetamine. i was actually sold meth instead of cocaine by someone i thought i could trust at the time. ending up doing too much and almost lost my life. nothing has been the same since then. i was able to quit meth but the near death experience changed me forever. my body was completely numb that night and i was barely able to dial 911. this was my first panic attack of many and became the ptsd event i\\'ll never forget. talking to the responder as the ambulance arrived calmed me down enough that i decided to turn away the ambulance when they arrived, but this night is as fresh in my memory as if it just happened yesterday. ever since then i get panic attacks from any unfamiliar body sensation. like, heart palpitating, limb-numbing, im-about-to-die panic attacks. some days are okay, some no so okay, and some just miserable. something as natural as bad gas will send me into a panic because i think my heart is about to stop, the cyclical thinking takes over and i\\'m done for. i found alcohol at a young age and became a severe drinker for about 5 years (21-26). alcohol made everything okay. i started drinking all day every day. the girl i mentioned earlier was a heavy drinker as well. we got married. last year she was driving drunk and got into a fatal accident. we had been togther for 7 years. i\\'ve also lost a sister to heroin and my closest friend to a heart attack. all of these instant deaths just reaffirm my belief that i\\'m going to die instantly at some point, so i\\'m constantly anxious and plagued with apprehension about when this will happen. i gave up drinking last year after my wife passed. it has been hard but i\\'m doing a little better with the alcohol dependancy out of the picture. i\\'m currently clean and sober but have been taking kratom occasionally. i go to therapy and i like it, it helps, but it\\'s no cure for my problem. i barely eat or sleep these days. i can hardly breathe. i have no friends. i had to move back home with my dad and stepmom but i don\\'t get along with either of them too well. i\\'m just a weirdo and no one understands me. i feel like i\\'m going to die any moment and it\\'s tormenting me. i\\'m always on the verge of the next panic attack. i don\\'t know what to do. i want it to be over but i also fear death. i feel so hopeless.', 'text_b': None, 'label': 4}, {'guid': 2052, 'text_a': 'celebrating small victories i’ve taken to drawing and

they won't be anymore. a few weeks ago, i noticed that my sister had been going through a bit of a rough patch, but me being selfish, i never talked to her about it, i never tried to help. then, one day i came home from an evening of hanging with my girlfriend. i walked up the stairs and called out hello, and i received nothing but silence. i looked back and saw my sisters car parked in front of the house, so i knew she was home, so i walked up to her room, and knocked on the door calling out her name, once again i got no answer. i figured she was asleep or wanted to be alone, so i went to my room. i went to go heat up some leftovers, and i wanted to know if she wanted any. i knocked on her door, but got no response. puzzled by this, i walked to the side of out house, where you could see through her window. her curtains were closed, but her lights were on, and through the translucency of her curtains i could see the shadow of something large hanging. at that moment my heart dropped. i ran as fast as i could back inside to her room, screaming her name. i ran full speed into her locked door, ripping out one of the hinges. as i climbed over the door, i looked up to the most horrifying sight i could ever imagine. it was my sister hanging from her ceiling fan. that image has been seared into my mind, and no matter where i am, or what i'm doing, it's always there, haunting me. i blame

filled with these stupid posts about suicide awareness shared by people who don\\'t really care, but are sharing posts to make them feel better about themselves. finally i couldn\\'t take it anymore and i posted this on facebook. i figured it was time that i let people know what it is like for someone who struggles with suicidal thoughts on a regular basis to be bombarded with these posts. below is what i posted on facebook: &gt;\\\\*\\\\*okay so this might trigger some people because it\\'s going to be a rant about suicide (hence the title) so if that bothers you please skedaddle\\\\*\\\\* &gt; &gt;okay friends... let us explore a sensitive topic for a moment. what topic you ask? why suicide of course. okay so by know i am sure you have heard about the latest celebrity suicides in the news or the 1.3 million posts on facebook. so i feel dumb for even having to say this but suicide is a really serious topic and whether you realize it or not there are people on your friends list who are currently struggling with suicidal thoughts and may also have a history of suicidal tendencies. now while you may mean no harm when you are sharing that post about celebrities (celebrities that you didn\\'t know or care about until their suicide became news) committing suicide, you are inadvertently triggering several people who are actively working to keep suicide and suicidal thoughts out of their stream of thoughts. these people might not be presently in danger of committing suicide and they may not even seem depressed, but trust me they are out there. &gt; &gt;faq: &gt; &gt;q: if you are so easily triggered than why do you go on facebook? &gt; &gt;a: facebook is a place where people go to connect with friends and share ideas. unfortunately facebook lacks the ability to allow users to block certain posts/words from their feed because they are triggering so we all have to see them whether they like it or not. don\\'t be an ass. &gt; &gt;q: isn\\'t it important to share these posts to raise awareness for those at risk of committing suicide? &gt; &gt;a: absolutely not. suicide is not a new topic of discussion. it\\'s not a topic that should not be \"trending\" along with other pop culture topics. also, people seem to care about suicide while posts like this are trending, but stop caring after a short amount of time. it\\'s important to realize that suicide is always a problem that affects our community and not just after someone famous does it. in fact, in the us, someone dies from suicide every 12 minutes (thanks for the stat cdc) but there are no trending posts for those people is there? that\\'s right mate. &gt; &gt;q: what can i do to help myself or one of my friends who is currently suicidal? &gt; &gt;a: most importantly.. listen to them. don\\'t give them some patronizing shit like \"it\\'ll get better\" or pretend you can relate if you\\'ve never struggled with suicide or suicidal thoughts before. just be a good friend and hear them out. now if that person seems to be actively suicidal or has a plan in place to commit suicide advise them to contact the national suicide prevention lifeline at 1\\\\-800\\\\-273\\\\-8255. also if you/your friend does not like to talk on the phone (who does, amirite?) they can contact the crisis text line by texting \"connect\" to 741741. the wonderful people at these numbers will give you/them some resources to help get through this rough patch. and of course if you feel that you or someone you love (or someone you don\\'t love) is experiencing a true psychiatric emergency and needs help right away, please call 911 or go to the nearest er. &gt; &gt;now if you made it to the end of this post i applaud your patience and i appreciate you hanging in there with me. suicide is a topic that has really affected me personally and i created this post to help share what it is like for someone who is suicidal or has a history of suicidal tendencies to be bombarded with these posts that have been going around facebook lately. suicide is always out there and it\\'s important to support those you love (and even those you don\\'t love) who are battling with depression and experience suicidal thoughts all the time. &gt; &gt;i hope you got something out of this because while the idea for this post may have been inspired by feeling hurt, it was written out out of love. please stop sharing

disgusting, disrespectful pieces of s\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* with me. but my answers weren\\'t that good either. they were weak, stupid and immature. id say, \"oh thats because of my low self steem... so i do this and that to cope and blablabla\". but that doesnt mean they werent horrible with me. regardless, they were bad to me, very toxic in fact...and at the time i had no clue how to defend myself... i was a young teen at the time. i cared so much about their opinions about me, i overthought about them and what they would think if i did x in y situation... mainly because eveyone was on their side all the time and it made me feel like i was the bad guy here. but if you ever, ever feel like you\\'re alone and everyone is against you, you\\'re actually far from alone. when i started growing i noticed how disrespectful they actually were to me and they apologized but it was too late i didnt give a damn. i moved out to college and never spoke to them again or intend to do so. and if you have those called \"friends\" who drain you, make you feel horrible for who you are or who you\\'re not or make you feel so down about your traits, drop them on the nearest bin. or the
